0,1,"This cute home was absolutely perfect for our wine tasting weekend! The views from the house were spectacular, the rooms were cozy, and the getting in hot tub was a great way to end the day. Jason was super helpful, responsive, and thought of everything to make this experience the best it could be. We can’t wait to come back!"

5,1,"Absolutely stunning view! The place was clean and so inviting. Jason and Mary went above and beyond to ensure we enjoyed our stay - the cinnamon rolls were a delicious surprise! Close to surrounding wineries and restaurants in Elkin (~10 min drive). The bed was so comfortable! We had so many friends reach out for details on how to stay here, for good reason. We will 100% be back to watch the sunset and gaze at the stars from the hot tub!"
6,1,"Swan Creek A-frame is a MUST!

I booked Jason’s cabin for a surprise anniversary getaway and I am so pleased with my experience! This beautiful cabin has everything you need to escape your busy city life. Rolling hills, gorgeous green pastures full of grazing cows, fresh air, picturesque views and all the comforts of home. Plus a HOT TUB!
The cabin was easy to access, stocked with essentials extremely cozy and the cleanliness was top notch. I’m a neat freak and can easily find something unkept but this cabin had me 100 percent satisfied and comfortable. I would absolutely recommend a trip to Swan Creek and can’t wait to visit again!"
7,1,Thankyou Carrie ! We appreciate the kind review. So glad you enjoyed your stay !
8,1,Jason’s place was beautiful! So clean with all of the amenities you could need. We appreciated the quiet hillside but also loved being close to Elkin for their great bars and restaurants. The quality coffee beans and the fresh cinnamon rolls were such a nice touch! We’ll hopefully be back

11,1,"We truly enjoyed our getaway weekend. Jason was very helpful and attentive. We just loved the location on the hillside, which allowed for some amazing views of the valley and mountain ranges.

This A-frame house is a thing of dreams! It’s wonderfully modern and sleek, but with a variety of cute, personal touches, which make it very cozy. I especially loved the chair swing near the window!

We also enjoyed a great evening around the fire pit, roasting marshmallows and reading together.

We came here to unwind and reset, and that’s just what we were able to do! This will definitely be high on our list of places to visit again."
12,1,We had a great time staying here! Such a peaceful and relaxing spot right next to wineries.

Its within driving distance of stone park, the andy Griffith museum and the town of Mayberry . Pirates landing is a great seafood restaurant and theos Italian restaurant we enjoyed as well. Definitely book this unique getaway"
15,1,"This little A frame has been one of our best Airbnb experiences! It was spotless and had everything we needed, including binoculars for the mountain views. We loved using the hot tub and drinking coffee on the porch while looking out over the farm fields. Jason is a great host with wonderful recommendations and always quick to respond to messages. We got to celebrate our 2 year anniversary here and it was the perfect place for it. Would highly recommend!"
16,1,"Jason was so friendly, helpful,
and responsive, and accommodated a slightly early check in. He was so kind to leave us roasting sticks for the fire, even though we ended up being too busy enjoying the view of the mountains from their beautiful hot tub to use the fire pit and cornhole boards! He was so helpful and even added kitchen photos to help us plan what to bring to cook in their lovely kitchen. The view during the day and night was stunning. The interior was cozy (loved all the blankets) and well designed and spaced for four friends. As others have mentioned, Jason and Mary went above and beyond by leaving a note and handmade coffee cake ❤️We could not have been more pleased with the stay and would love to visit again some day."
17,1,"My fiancé and I booked this get away with my sister & her husband, and were very happy with our stay. The host was very responsive. The aframe house is very unique with beautiful views from inside the house. Our favorite part of the house was watching the sunset and looking at the stars from the hot tub. There were also lots of places to hike and beautiful wineries in the area. Highly recommend!!"

29,1,Thankyou Duane ! We appreciate the kind review!
30,1,"We loved this stay! It was a perfect place for our short couples retreat.

The aframe is stunning both inside and outside with the views! We loved the hot tub on the deck that overlooks the mountains and peaceful farm lands.

It was all very private and quiet.

The bedding was clean and comfortable!
The bathroom was fresh and clean.

Just enough space in the kitchen and living area to relax and have nice home cooked meals.

We loved that there was plenty of space for us to practice yoga either inside or on the deck.

The host was really on top of the communications before and during our stay.

We loved it and would stay again ☺️"
31,1,Thankyou Rachel ! We’d love to have you back !
32,1,"The a-frame was easy to find, and spotlessly clean. We had a relaxing girls weekend here, and spent hours enjoying the view and the hot tub. The only problem we had was deciding which winery to visit for a wine tasting. Check-in and check-out were very simple, and the a-frame was furnished very well. I would definitely stay here again."
33,1,Thankyou for the review! We can see how the winery decision could cause an issue 😃Thankyou again for the kind review !
34,1,Such a wonderful stay! Would 100% return. So exciting so see such a beautiful part of NC! Jason is so helpful and responsive.
35,1,This place is beautiful we will return again soon ❤️ ♥️
36,1,"This stay was absolutely perfect and exactly what we thought it would be. With a beautiful view of the mountains, a gorgeous sunset, a fun hot tub, and a relaxing, intimate space, we were able to have a wonderful weekend. Jason, the host, was responsive and attentive to all of our needs. He was easily reached and quick with communication. We took advantage of his suggestions and got dinner at one of the local seafood restaurants (a great date night place). Overall, a lovely weekend, enjoying each other and God’s beautiful nature views."
37,1,"We had an amazing stay. Cozy place, wonderful view, Jason is very helpful and quickly answers our calls helping us. We will definitely be back ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"

40,1,Such beautiful views and an aesthetically cute A-frame stay. The host was easily reachable and was quick to respond. Definitely worth the money and would consider staying again!
41,1,"We really loved staying at Jason’s. It had 180° views of the mountains and felt very much at home.
It had anything and everything we didn’t even know we might want including candles, French press, robes, and plenty of pillows and throw blankets.
There was a coffee cake for us when we arrived and had it with breakfast for the three mornings we got to spend there. It was absolutely delicious and I would book this place again just for it.
Food lion, restaurants, and snack bars are less than a 10 minute drive away.
The house is very well lit, clean, and the perfect amount of space for the two of us to cook three dinners and relax. The surrounding cows were very nice to look out on in the mornings. Would move in tomorrow if we could.
Jason was very a helpful and responsive host who recommended local wineries, breweries, and coffee.

We’ll be back, out of the other airbnbs we’ve stayed at this is our favorite"
42,1,Great cozy place to get away from the hustle and bustle. Amazing views and centrally located to quite a few things with just a short drive. Coffee cake was also amazing and the coffee blend was superb. Great stay and would recommend
43,1,"Jason and Mary’s place looks even better than the pictures. Don’t think twice about staying here! The modern A-frame cabin is such a beautiful aesthetic. The surroundings are so peaceful and there are plenty of gorgeous wineries to tour if you’d like. Raffaldini’s was my favorite and it’s just down the road. The hot tub was clean and cozy on a cold night, the space was clean and full of thoughtful touches—don’t forget about the fire pit above the cabin and corn hole set up to the side. It’s so nice to see cows settled down in the nearby pasture when you wake up in the morning! Overall my favorite Air BnB I’ve ever stayed in."
44,1,"Jason’s place was very nice & we enjoyed all the amenities it offered. The hot tub was super relaxing and clean and seeing the cows outside was awesome! The home was immaculately cleaned, the bed was EXTREMELY comfy & the loft was super cool. We enjoyed our Christmas getaway. Jason was very kind and accommodating to our small hiccup we had on the trip, which we were very grateful for! Stay here if you love antique shopping and thrifting :)"
45,1,This place is beautiful and fun. A great place for a getaway with my wife.
46,1,We are coming back!
47,1,"Our stay at the A-frame was incredible! Easily one of our top places we’ve stayed in since joining Airbnb! Such a beautiful, private and peaceful place to get away with incredible views from every angle of the property. Highly recommend!! Jason and Mary were very friendly as well! Mary even baked us a coffee cake that was incredibly delicious and it added that extra spark to top off our amazing stay. If we’re ever looking to go back to this area, without hesitation we will be booking this spot again!"
48,1,very nice little place. everything was as expected.
49,1,Thank you ! We’re glad you enjoyed your stay!
50,1,"Perfect little getaway spot! The cabin was clean and stocked with anything you could possibly need.

The area is quiet and the views are amazing. Would love to come back again soon!"
51,1,"This cabin is the perfect little romantic getaway! Jason is very helpful and promptly responds if you need him. The cabin was pristine, and quaint. It had everything we were looking for! The views are absolutely stunning, and it’s situated less than 2 miles from the newest up and coming wine regions in the country! I’ve been to California, Charlottesville, Asheville, and some between and I would put these vintages against any I’ve tried! If you like Italian grapes or French, you can find wine within a 30 minute drive!"
52,1,Thankyou for your Feedback! We appreciate it. We’re so glad your stay was enjoyable!
53,1,Very peaceful and relaxing stay. Cozy and comfortable. Loved watching the cows right from the house.

Cozy, homey, romantic place to stay with amazing views of mountains and valleys.
All the attention to details made it a very special experience.
They even offer a specialty coffee ~ it is amazing! You will want to try it!
A well stocked kitchen ~ very nice. And a very cozy bedroom!❤️"
60,1,We appreciate the feedback. Thanks!! Glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay!
61,1,"We had a really good stay here! It was far enough off the road to be nice and quiet, beautiful views of the surrounding mountains. The space is very unique with the angled windows in the front. Not super big inside but it didn’t feel crowded. The view from the loft is amazing! If you are looking for a quiet weekend getaway in the country and enjoy watching the sunset from the hot tub then you will probably like this place!"
62,1,Thankyou for the review Jacob . We appreciate the feedback and are glad you enjoyed your stay !
63,1,Nice place for a mini vacay!
64,2,The treehouse was amazing! It was very private and cozy. My fiancé and I arrived late at night and they had turned on the heater for our arrival which was much appreciated. We stayed for 4 nights and Chris and Torie checked in multiple times to make sure we were all set and to see if we needed anything. Their guidebook was perfect and there was so much to do in the area. Highly recommend.
65,2,Staying in this treehouse was nothing short of magical! The perfect mountain getaway that's cozy and intimate without leaving any of the comforts of home behind.
66,2,Everything was great and completely what we expected…loved it!
67,2,The treehouse is just as magical as it looks in the pictures! It was chilly our first night (low 40s) and we were cozy and warm. Beautiful deck for coffee in the morning and wine in the evening. You feel like you are isolated deep in the woods while you are right in their backyard! It is an experience you dont want to miss!
68,2,such an amazing experience and such great hosts! definitely will be back :)
69,2,"Wow! One of my favorite Airbnb stays! It was the perfect treehouse in nature, but still close to the city. It was private, thoughtful, and the perfect getaway for a solo adventure! Perfect for two people as well.

I enjoyed the outdoor shower and composting toilet. Got me back to my roots ;). I will def be back!

The deck porch was so cute and loved the fire pit!"
70,2,Such a sweet spot and perfect for a little photography project my friend and I had in mind. so glad they let us use the treehouse!!
71,2,"So thankful for this opportunity to room WOTH Christopher and Torie! They were amazing! The place was so peaceful and exactly what I needed to relax and take a few days off from ADULTING 😂
I highly recommend the tree house!
I’ll be back very soon!"
72,2,The Beacon Treehouse was perfect for a cozy night in!
73,2,"This spot was very cozy and warm during the cold nights with the overhead heating and blankets. It was a little close to the highway, but still private enough. We had some weather issues with the shower, but the hosts were communicative and honest about it."
74,2,"It was lovely. A little close to the main house but very cool to stay in a tree house with a coffee maker. it had heated blankets, and boy did they work. very close to everything. Sitting outside next to the fire 🔥was the highlight for me. if you want to get away and disconnect this is perfect."
75,2,"Their place was great! I stayed the night before going hiking, and it was perfect! The lights made it magical and it was private and well-kept! Worth it!"
76,2,"The treehouse was exactly as described! Dreams do come true! Caring hosts, a nice little town with friendly people!"
77,2,such a magical little place! thank you so much for making our trip special!
78,2,We really enjoyed our stay. It was a great place for a weekend getaway to unplug and unwind. We absolutely loved the place. Look forward to going back
79,2,Cozy little tree house perfect for time away from everyday stresses
80,2,trip was for my fiancé and i! we had so much fun her and i felt safe and cozy! small peaceful town with great food and vibes for all walks of life :) Christopher and Torie have a great bnb and i hope everyone gets to enjoy it!
81,2,"Its was a beautiful place to stay, we loved the whole set up! The fireplace is adorable and thank goodness for the heated-blanket thanks to the cold weather this weekend. The string lights add just the right touch, and what a beautiful place to stay in general.

The only things I’d say, is I wish there wasn’t such a large opening that was covered by a screen in the room where lots of wind came in so it was hard to keep warm. As well as not knowing the shower wasn’t going to work. There also isn’t any running water other than the shower so make sure to bring your own water."
82,2,The stay was amazing ! Super clean and beautiful and peaceful! Close to town which was nice too!
83,2,"This place is adorable! It brought my fairytale fantasy to life. Super cozy, so thankful for the cute decor and heated blanket. Thank you so much, I would definitely stay again"
84,2,"We had the best time at Christopher & Torie’s place! It was so cozy and peaceful and was perfect for a weekend getaway. Even though it was freezing out, we stayed warm with the heated blanket and never felt uncomfortable. Overall it was a beautiful location and the stay exceeded my expectations. We will definitely be back!"
85,2,"What a cute and cosy place !! It was a dreamy evening we spent here. It was warm and comfy in spite of the chilly winds outside.
The decorated bedroom and amenities are very convenient. We couldn’t use the shower as the temperatures were below freezing, but we were given sufficient heads up. We would definitely return in spring for another experience and use the fire pit 😍 100% recommended for a romantic evening!"
86,2,loved this treehouse! we had a great time!
87,2,The treehouse was beautiful and Christopher and Torie were helpful and accommodating. Would definitely stay here again!
88,2,"We have wanted to stay in a tree house for years. Well let me tell you this place did not disappoint us at all! It is so cute and peaceful! We listened to the rain on the roof and snuggled. The bed was so comfortable and I wanted to take the comforter home with me! The lighting is something out of a fairy tail! The heated blanket and the heater are top grade! We ended up turning both off after and hour because it stayed warm all night in the room. The ladder is something I was a littler nerves about but not after I went up it one time. It’s very well made. It’s not straight up so very easy to go up and down. We went downtown and had an amazing
meal some drinks. It only a couple of minutes from everything but feels like it own secluded world. Definitely recommend this tree house if you want a romantic quite get away or just peace."
89,2,"This was our first tree house experience, and it did not disappoint. The bed and pillows were very comfortable, and the room was beautiful. It was 40 degrees outside, but we didn't even need to turn on the heater or heated blanket. We stayed warm through the night. The traffic is a little loud, but ear plugs were provided, so it didn't bother us much. Would recommend this to anyone who loves the outdoors and glamping!"
90,2,"Chris and Torie’s treehouse is the stuff that dreams are made of. Everything fit the description and pictures to a T. My husband and I visited for a quick get away to celebrate his birthday and couldn’t have had a better experience. Chris and Torie were very responsive, offered great recommendations, and made sure to check on us multiple times. The treehouse was comfy and cozy and beautifully decorated. We enjoyed a nice fire in the fire pit and loved the ambiance of the lights. Of course, our favorite part was the heated blanket and bed. We stayed nice and warm despite the temperature being in the 20s. My husband said “this is how kings sleep”. Our favorite Air BnB experience so far by a long shot!"
91,2,Such a romantic and peaceful night!
92,2,We loved this fun stay!
93,2,The listing 100% matched the photos. The treehouse was extremely cozy and clean. Plenty of restaurants and things to do locally. I loved staying here on vacation and I would definitely do it again
94,2,"Such a novelty in glamping!! I more than enjoyed staying here for a few nights. Christopher & Torie made the stay extra special by helping celebrate a birthday; so kind & generous! The weather was rainy at times, only adding to the natural ambiance! The outdoor bathroom was particularly my favorite aspect, specifically the shower. So very thankful for this experience, & to escape into nature so comfortably."
95,2,"Christopher and Torie’s treehouse was perfect for a weekend getaway. It is close to town, yet feels isolated and cozy. I would definitely stay again and recommend!"
96,2,Awesome Host awesome stay
97,2,Very cute treehouse! It was definitely a chilly night but it was so worth it for the peaceful vibes!
98,2,"Our stay at the tree house was a great getaway for the weekend. Didn't expect it to be as cold as it was, but we stayed warm with the heater and electric blanket. It's very close to downtown Hendersonville, so plenty of restaurants and pubs. Also close to some of the wineries in the area. The tree house was clean and neat with an extremely comfy bed. We would definitely stay here again."
99,2,The tree house was perfect for a little getaway! So cute and cozy. The heater and heated blanket are plenty to keep you warm!
100,2,Christopher and Torie’s place was better than we imagined! It poured all through our stay but the treehouse kept us warm and dry. The bed is very comfortable and the sound of the rain on the roof was so peaceful. We wish we could’ve stayed longer!
101,2,The cutest little getaway!! Everything about this treehouse was so perfect! I felt safe and comfortable all night!
102,2,Everything was wonderful from the location to the communication of the hosts. They checked in with us every day to see if there was anything we need it or if we had any questions. We could not have had a better weekend.
103,2,"Overall the best air-bnb I’ve stayed at. Lovely little space tucked in their backyard with beautiful lighting and vines everywhere. There wasn’t a sink in the room which is okay but would’ve been very nice to have. We didn’t realize it would be so close to the house where children are and woodworking projects take place. They did stop the sawing and nailing before quiet hours, we just didn’t expect to hear kids and nail-guns. All and all great place and would recommend to anyone."
104,2,"If you are on the fence, do it! It was so fun staying in the treehouse, I didn't want to leave! So cozy and comfortable. I highly recommend!! Be aware there is no wifi...but it was so nice to disconnect for the night."
105,2,Loved how cozy the treehouse is and how the thought about everything!!
106,2,We are big campers so we absolutely loved this. It was pretty cold out but the heater and heated blanket kept us plenty warm. All of the lights and decor are so charming and adorable. I would highly recommend!

110,2,"What an amazing find and what a great location
It was perfect and every detail was right there, even had my favorite coffee creamer!!Such a cozy place to just relax and take in nature!!"
111,2,Have you ever wanted to spend the night inside a Christmas tree? Here's your chance. So many lights!! Can't say enough good things about this stay! It was like something out of a dream.
112,2,gorgeous treehouse and great location
113,2,"100/10!! Absolutely amazing, magical, comfy, cozy and beautiful stay. Highly recommend. This was our first treehouse stay and we will definitely be back."
114,2,"We loved staying in this enchanting little treehouse. Christopher and Torie were very responsive and even with stormy weather, we loved playing games on the covered porch. Another highlight was Sky Top Orchard- apple picking was the perfect activity to start our five year anniversary getaway!"
115,2,We loved staying in this treehouse! Definitely an experience we will never forget! Waking up and having a fresh cup of coffee up in the trees was so relaxing!
116,2,"Magical place! Lighting, fire pit, lovely rustic decor- all added up to charm! Hot water for shower, chairs upstairs and down, fan covers most traffic noise, Keurig/coffee/water bottles supplied- comfy memory foam mattress. Very convenient to downtown. Awesome stay!!!"
117,2,The most magical stay! Highly recommend staying here if you ever get a chance!

119,2,Great place. Really unique and enjoyed our stay!
120,2,"Amazing place, definitely want to come back. They did a great job!"
121,2,"I surprised my wife with a quick stay in a treehouse. Initially she was confused as I walked her down the short path but as she settled from the shock, she loved it. The bed has wonderful memory foam and I slept way better than a hotel. It rained the duration of the stay but this added a mystical charm as we were secluded in the small treehouse. The treehouse is close to the owners residence but it felt a mile away. Kudos!"
122,2,"Was a great stay! Really enjoyed the vibes of the treehouse, Chris and Torie were very gracious to us. I’ll be back again!"
123,2,"The treehouse was the perfect little stay on our road trip. Loved the twinkle lights, and the beautiful porch. So much fun roasting marshmallows over the fire. Dreamy stay for sure!"
124,2,"So cozy and so quiet! If you’re looking for a cute getaway with a ton of character, this is your spot."
125,2,We loved our stayed here.! Is was a great experience! My wife always wanted to stay in tree house & it was a dreamed came true. It was a wonderful days to relax & escape from the the world. You wont regret it! Thank you so much.
126,2,"What a great unique stay! Thank you Christopher & Torie for being kind & communicative hosts who provided us with easy directions & recommendations in the cute downtown of Hendersonville. Treehouse was clean, the bed was really comfortable & the warm shower felt great after an afternoon of hiking at Triple Falls only 15min away. Thanks again!"
127,2,"The pictures honestly don’t do it justice. It was a beautiful, magical looking treehouse and was incredibly comfortable and cozy inside. The hosts were very thoughtful. Will have to stay here again for sure sometime!"
128,2,Very private from their house. Exactly as listed!
129,2,This treehouse was sooo dreamy. Highly recommend tom anyone!
130,2,It was a great place!
131,2,"Made my husbands dream come true. He always wanted to stay in a treehouse. Found this spot and it was absolutely stunning! From the moment we walked the trail to get to the treehouse to inside. Everything was stunning. My husband is constantly working and on his days off always doing for others and nothing for him, so I wanted to make sure on this particular day since it was also his birthday he would enjoy and relax the nature and surroundings this place offered. Chris and Torie went above and beyond when I reached out and ask for some assistance setting up.

They were quick to respond. Place was clean and organized. Instructions on how to use certain lights were detailed and explained. Close to literally everything. 5-10 minute drives.

Best part about our night, it drizzled until morning and it was amazing! Listening to the rain and seeing it from the roof of the treehouse.

Thank you Chris and Torie 🧿"
132,2,"Beautiful treehouse, very calming and good for the price, my only complaint is that the only clean water came from the shower, which was a bit weird. Christopher and Torie we’re both very gracious and checked in often, and created a lovely little corner of Hendersonville for their guests. I really liked it"
133,2,Great treehouse! 😊
134,2,"We had the most wonderful experience! Every detail was perfect, and it felt like I was living out a childhood dream. We could not have asked for anything more. Thank you Chris and Torie!"

138,2,Very nice and unique a must do experience.
139,2,We had a wonderful time in the treehouse! It was just as cute as pictured and was a really fun “glamping” experience. The woods were beautiful and the sound of rain on the roof was magical. Thank you for a great stay!
140,2,Thanks for the stay!
141,2,We loved our stay. It was so much better than we imagined! The treehouse is beautiful at night and it felt like living in a fairytale. We were so sad to leave but super grateful for the time we had.
142,2,We enjoyed our stay. The treehouse was exactly like the listing and better. We were concern with the heat but the fan that Christopher and Torie had in the treehouse kept it cool all night. We can’t wait to come back. Christopher and Torie was very accommodating and allowed us to check in early. Thank you for the beautiful experience♥️
143,2,Beautiful and peaceful stay! Close to the downtown area which had some good restaurants. I’d definitely visit again.
144,2,"Thanks again for letting us visit your tree house ! Everything and more ! Excellent hosts !! Only wish we had more time ! I was a little worried about climbing up as I have a limp and being a little older, but they have thought of Everything and had a great sturdy railing to hold on to ! Hope to make it back there again for a week end trip!"
145,2,"Cute quirky treehouse, just as described! We had a blast!"
146,2,The Beacon Treehouse was a great stay for our 5th wedding anniversary!!
147,2,Amazing and cute little nature getaway
148,2,"My daughter and I had a wonderful girls weekend with the help of this amazing treehouse. My favorite part was listening to the rain on the roof before we went to sleep and my 7 year olds favorite thing was the outdoor shower (she said it was “the best shower of her life”). If you choose to stay here, you are sure to have a magical experience!"
149,2,"Super comfy bed, super close to some awesome waterfalls and great food in the small town of Hendersonville. There is a bit of road noise which is obvious if you don’t have the fan on. Overall great stay."
150,2,We loved the treehouse!!! It felt like a beautiful fairy treehouse and even though it was the middle of summer the fan helped and it wasnt unbearably hot. Amazing stay :)
151,2,"We've been interested in staying in a treehouse for a while, and this location - on the drive back from our honeymoon - provided the perfect opportunity! Lots of sweet little touches that really made the experience."
152,2,Our treehouse dreams were fulfilled! We loved the comfy bed and the heated outdoor shower! The lights created a romantic atmosphere. It’s a must if you are in the area :)
153,2,Very beautiful area! Loved the treehouse. It was so nice & peaceful
154,2,Everything was amazing at this place. We felt secluded but supported. Everything was perfect for what we were looking for.
155,2,beautiful stay and very comfortable bed! hosts were very communicative and easy to get in touch with.
156,2,"Such a fun, unique experience! Was all the “roughing it” this city girl can handle! Loved being able to hear all sounds of nature, especially an owl!"
157,2,"This was such a cute and unique place to stay for the night. Be prepared for the bathroom situation (which is about as nice as it can be without being an indoor bathroom). Was worried about the road noise but had no problem at sleeping at night, especially with the fan going. Overall a great place to stop through, and very close to Hendersonville!"
158,2,Fabulous
159,2,This stay was absolutely perfect for a weekend getaway. The hosts were extremely nice and accommodating. The tree house was special. The space was perfect for a little glamping. The shower was amazing. Would definitely recommend this stay!
160,2,Perfectly described in the listing. Several small touches that make it feel so comfortable and homey. We have already shared this place with several friends and plan to return.
161,2,"This treehouse was gorgeous inside and out. The host went out of their way to set up a cute surprise for my partner and I. There was also a cute fire pit that has fresh cut wood for us to use. One of my favorite parts of the stay was how pretty it looked lit up at night. I would definitely stay here again. A cool experience!

Just a tip! The bathroom is below the treehouse and if you are staying here make sure to pack shower shoes or some kind of flip flops that you can easily switch in and out of."
162,2,Cool treehouse! Even better than the photos. We had such a great experience here. Also the nest morning we went to a nearby brunch place Arabellas in Hendersonville. It's such a cute town.
163,2,Amazing place. Very clean and beautiful. Highly recommend.
164,2,"I wasn't expecting the house to be on their property (about 25 yards from their home) but the place was covered with trees and brush for privacy, so no issue there!. It is right next to a busy road if you care about that, I didn't mind though I actually like white noise while I sleep! overall, a pleasant experience. a vacation of my little self's dreams!!"
165,2,"We had a lovely stay at the Treehouse! It is relaxing and serene sleeping under the treetops. The weather was perfect! The outdoor bathroom was nice although bring along some hand sanitizer or soap for hand washing. The lights were left on for us, when we arrived just after dark. It was easy to find and a very cute little treehouse. My boyfriend is an engineer and marveled at the craftsmanship. The hosts communicated with us well about how to work everything and even sent a message to check on us during our stay. We absolutely loved it!"
166,2,Cozy and very peaceful!
167,2,"What a gem! Although our stay was short it was very sweet. We both work from home and wanted a little getaway to unplug. This treehouse was a dream. The bed was like sleeping on a cloud! The little touches made everything so special - the lights, the diffuser, the bedding and pillows… Utterly wonderful. It’s so magically! My favorite part was the outdoor shower. So relaxing. We will be back!"
168,2,Great city escape. Nice experience
169,2,Amazing treehouse in an great location. Excellent value. Christopher and Torie do a fantastic job communicating and providing a relaxing visit while providing many suggestions for activities. We will definitely look to come back in the future.
170,2,"My husband and I celebrated our one-year anniversary at Christopher and Torie’s tree house. The treehouse is adorable and beautiful at night with all of the lights. It is only a few minutes away from downtown, so we were able to quickly and easily grab some dinner. My husband and I had a great time, and we really hope to return sometime soon."
171,2,"We loved our stay at the treehouse! It rained our entire stay but the treehouse was a cozy, intimate place to snuggle up and enjoy being in nature. Such a unique place and great hosts. We will definitely book again if we are back in the area!"
172,2,The tree house is so beautiful and it’s very relaxing to wake up and hear the birds
173,2,What a wonderful stay! The experience was everything we expected. Hope to be back again soon 😊
174,2,Amazing stay at this treehouse. My wife and I enjoyed the quiet and comfy accommodations. Very close to downtown too. Hosts were always available.
175,2,Loved this unique little get away!
176,4,Amazing and peaceful place. Perfect place to unwind. Will definitely stay here again!
177,4,"The Treehouse is so lovely, thoughtfully designed, and in a truly idyllic setting. We enjoyed our stay immensely!

Loved watching the sunrise over the lake while drinking our morning coffee.

You can easily take a Lyft to uptown Charlotte if you prefer to dine out. The host recommended —The Crunkleton and it did not disappoint!!

We hope to return for a longer stay!!"
178,4,It was everything I expected!
179,4,Amazing and beautiful stay for any couple! What a treat for all
180,4,"I booked 1 night for a little staycation just by myself . I wish I could have stayed longer!! It was the peaceful evening I needed - laid in bed reading, woke up to the sunrise and coffee overlooking the lake and spent the morning relaxing. If I do it again I’ll book 2 nights at a minimum."
181,4,Very charming and great use of space as we felt comfortable and right at home! Loved how we were able to wake up to a sunset over the pond/lake and finish the night with a fire as well.
182,4,"Pictures do not do this wonderful retreat justice, it’s beautiful, nicely decorated and clean. Me and my hubby had a wonderful, restful, relaxing vacation and will definitely return."
183,4,Perfect spot to recharge and relax with your favorite person. We can’t wait to book our next stay there!
184,4,Highly recommend! This home is absolutely gorgeous. The location is perfect and hosts were top notch. We will definitely be back.
185,4,A really amazing space for a getaway. Everything is as described. So cozy and cute! Our stay was perfect. Will 100% be going back!
186,4,Weather caused the outdoor space not to be inviting for use.
187,4,"This little oasis is the perfect place to unwind. I lucked out with beautiful 70 degree weather in February and was able to really take advantage of all the incredible outdoor amenities Alyssa + Brian have brought to the space. Every detail was perfectly thought out and the communication from Alyssa was super informative! With a short 15 minute drive into the city, this spot is truly the best of both worlds! It was a great stay and I will definitely be back!"
188,4,ABSOLUTELY beautiful...we are newly married and jus the break we needed...love a clean place..the view was amazing frm swing bed outside in the morning..love it!
189,4,This was the perfect weekend getaway! I loved that there’s no TV so you can really take advantage of the amenities and enjoy the peace and quiet. Alyssa and Brian were very quick to respond with any questions we had. They also we’re flexible with check in time as we got into town earlier than expected. Overall 10/10 stay!!!
190,4,"Great place to relax, sit by the fire, and enjoy good company. I recommend checking it out!"
191,4,Amazing place! Very peaceful and beautiful. Super close to all charlotte has to offer!
192,4,"Being a Charlotte native I was a little hesitant about the area but the area has changed and it was nice & safe. The treehouse is in the cut and you really don't feel like you are in Charlotte. It was quiet and peaceful. It looks exactly like the pictures online. Clean. Quiet. Relaxing. Our stay was during the ""winter"" but we took advantage of the outside shower. But definitely book even if you are looking for a staycation which is what we did."
193,4,A beautiful home in fantastically peaceful surroundings. Alyssa and Brian were exceptional hosts that were very responsive to communications and helpful when needed. I would definitely stay here again.
194,4,Great place!
195,4,"My boyfriend and I had a great time staying at the treehouse! It was so peaceful and private. We loved taking the kayaks out onto the pond. We would definitely recommend staying here for anyone that is interested, and we would love to go back in the future!"
196,4,"The Tree house is a great place with a unique vibe, location and style. It was a fun, peaceful and unique getaway for us. Thanks Alyssa and Brian."
197,4,"We can’t wait to stay again, such an awesome place!"
198,4,Wonderfully cozy spot that gets you out of your normal routine. Cozy surroundings make you relax and unplug from the modern world.
199,4,"We used to live in Charlotte and were passing through for a few days and loved the idea of experiencing Charlotte in an entirely different way with this unique treehouse. We really enjoyed the seclusion and serenity the treehouse offered while also being so close to the city. There were many thoughtful touches that made you want to spend your entire time at the treehouse. During our stay, we were able to enjoy an evening fire along the pond and watch the morning sunrise on the outdoor swinging bed while drinking tea. The listing does not hide nor call out that the only shower is outdoors, but this is something to keep in mind. Our stay happened to be during one of Charlotte's colder weeks so we waited until the sun was high enough to shower. Despite the chill in the air, there was a peaceful aspect about showering outside under the sun so I can only imagine it to be even more enjoyable in the warmer months!"
200,4,"The Carolina Treehouse did not disappoint! Alyssa & Brian were extremely responsive and helpful from the initial booking to check-out. We had been looking at this place for a while but never found an available time until recently. The treehouse looked exactly as pictured, well-equipt and cozy. We were a little nervous about the outdoor shower in December, but it was not an issue at all. Perfect for a couples getaway and very close to downtown Charlotte. We would not hesitate to book Alyssa & Brian's place again and plan to be back soon!"
201,4,It was a wonderful stay! Super cute
202,4,Absolutely amazing! We used this adorable Airbnb as our wedding ceremony with our immediate family and the details simply made our pictures and experience beautiful!
203,4,I truly enjoyed my stay! Thank you for sharing this gem with us.
204,4,Loved it
205,4,"It was a great place to relax, and it looked just like the photos!"
206,4,"As described
Not quite as secluded, but still fun"
207,4,"Ryan, thanks for staying with us! We enjoyed hosting you! We are located on 25 acres in a neighborhood but once at our treehouse we do feel as though it’s very secluded and private but happy to look into listing further to see where it may be described otherwise. We thank you for your feedback and hope to welcome you back again. Happy Holidays!!"
208,4,Beautiful getaway spot to relax and unwind!
209,4,"Was surprised how close to my house this place was. Super cute and discreet. Was easy to find, though parking spot was hide by leaves since it’s November. Looks just like the photos, enjoyed the outside very much. The outside shower was a great experience even in November. Got cold, but the space heater saved the day. We had plenty and didn’t even use everything. Would recommend. We did a couples quick trip so this was perfect for the occasion. There was a white dog outside at night which made us go inside earlier than we wanted to, but could of been lost or something there are houses near by but not that close. Private space and cozy."
210,4,We can’t recommend this stay enough! The Carolina Treehouse is beautifully decorated and has an amazing outdoor space. This peaceful getaway was just what we needed!
211,4,The property was excellent. We were really impressed and enjoyed every minute of our stay. We are looking forward to staying there again.
212,4,"It's a beautiful location and we really enjoyed our stay. The outdoor area is really amazing and is what made made me pick this rental.

However, I wish I would have known beforehand that there's no indoor shower. That's problematic in mid-November. I saw the outdoor shower in the pictures, but that appeared like an extra feature since it's on a lake.

Also, plan to arrive before dark or it is very hard to find. There are solar lights on a path to the house, but they didn't work/weren't on when we arrived."
213,4,"Hey Kaitlyn, thanks for staying with us. We enjoyed hosting you!! We apologize if wasn’t clear via photos or descriptions that our treehouse only has an outdoor shower. We take all weather conditions into account and have it working year round with amenities so it’s comfortable for guests and just a couple steps away from entrance as well.

Our path lights are on timers to work and shut off after 9pm. We apologize we weren’t aware of a late arrival or notified prior to this so we could of made other arrangements to better find the treehouse at a such a late hour for check in.

We thank you again for staying with us and look forward to welcoming you again!

— Alyssa & Brian"
214,4,"Ugh, words cannot describe our time here! The property is so beautiful and the treehouse itself is wonderfully built with the cutest decor/amenities. We were so relaxed here and it was truly a perfect fall escape. Would highly recommend!"
215,4,"We LOVED our stay here! So quiet and picturesque. It was hard to believe we were in the middle of the city, so private and scenic! And the treehouse was impeccably decorated and very clean."
216,4,Thoroughly enjoyed your treehouse! Such a bonus to feel like we “got away” during the workweek but had only a 15-20 minute drive! Look forward to checking out some of your other rentals!
217,4,We loved our stay in the beautiful Carolina Treehouse. It was a much needed peaceful getaway that we needed.
218,4,The Carolina Treehouse is such a great place to get away! We had a wonderful time relaxing and exploring downtown. Would definitely recommend! Great communication with owners and we had no issues at all during our stay:)
219,4,This unit was in a very scenic location and the unit itself is gorgeous. Definitely a place to disconnect from. Would recommend this unit for your next getaway and technology disconnect.
220,4,"My daughter and I really enjoyed ourselves! Such a beautiful place! It gives couples in love vibes. A lot of cute finds inside and out! I would definitely rent again but longer! Not too far from society but not too close either. I love their cleanup commitment! Firewood, games, and movie projector is provided! If you're being indecisive, just book it already! You won't regret it!!"
221,4,"Amazing oasis! So close to Charlotte, but you feel totally secluded and private. Place is super comfortable and fully stocked. Highly recommend for an easy, relaxing getaway!"
222,4,"Fantastic location - super private and peaceful, yet only minutes away from the heart of the Queen City. Highly recommend checking out this spot for a getaway with your favorite person!"
223,4,"The Carolina Treehouse surpassed our expectations. The house is so adorable and had everything you would need. The property and view were amazing especially given that it is so close to downtown. We met all of the wildlife (Blue Heron, otter, turtle and the geese) except the deer although they left there track. The owners are wonderful as well, responded quickly to our queries. We got to meet Alyssa and her Dad and they are both lovely and welcome. Thanks for a peaceful getaway and lasting memories."
224,4,"Wow! Just Wow! What an amazing place! If you’ve ever wanted a treehouse experience, this is it! The design and decor are fantastic! Cannot say enough good things about this place! You gotta try it!"
225,4,"it was absolute great, peaceful and serine!"
226,4,"Great and beautiful outdoor stay! They had kayaks, cornhole, and other games. Really goo place to forget about the outside world."
227,4,Beautiful and cozy! Easy to check in! Great location.
228,4,"This Treehouse was spectacular! We loved the outdoor shower, the water was so warm. We enjoyed fishing off the dock & cooking dinner on the grill. We highly recommend the NoDa neighborhood right near by. Loved loved smelly cat cafe & Haberdish for dinner, seriously one of the best meals we have ever had. We loved having coffee on the porch and reading our books. We also enjoyed having a fire pit :) Don’t hesitate to book!"
229,4,"Perfect pairing! Just the right amount of chic elements (her) mixed in with the outdoors (him) that allow us to reconnect. This place is a must for anyone looking for just enough remoteness without having to travel for hours, surrounded by trees where you can really take in some fresh air. It was the perfect place to get some relaxing time in. Thank you for creating this place."
230,4,Outdoors area is really nice.
231,4,Our trip was very relaxing and much needed! The decor and interior design was straight out of HGTV! The lake has plenty of fish!! This is a recommended trip for lovers of quiet and fishing!! The fire pit was awesome also! A bit pricy BUT it is close to everything in the city so You get the best of both worlds… you can go out and then come back to a quiet oasis with a beautiful view AND PEACE AND QUIET!
232,4,"Fairytale place, wish we could have stayed longer!"
233,4,We enjoyed our stay. Great place to relax and unwind.
234,4,"The treehouse was such an amazing experience! They thought of everything. It’s so convenient to everything, yet tucked away in a perfectly quiet and peaceful spot you feel like you are in your own little private hideaway. The outdoor bed/swing, hammock, fire-pit, kayaks, and wildlife. It’s the exact place you need to completely unwind and disconnect from it all. And if you have any questions at all, Alyssa & Brian answer promptly. Will definitely stay here again!"
235,4,"Me and my husband had the most amazing time at the treehouse for our anniversary. We had everything we needed to have the most peaceful, intimate getaway..Thank you Alyssa and Brian for an unforgettable experience."
236,4,Beautiful stay and great experience!
237,4,Great spot - very charming.
238,4,"Highly recommend making a visit to this beautifully designed treehouse. Very comfortable, clean and picturesque. Next time through we will be sure to pack the s’mores!"
239,4,"The stay here was ok. The best part was reconnecting with my partner and getting a chance to spend time alone together. However, I don’t think this space is worth as much as it cost ($1200 for two nights). The pictures made the place look amazing…the inside was pretty spot on but the outdoor space was very disappointing. The outdoor swinging bed had dirt all over it and spiders crawling all over and hanging from under the deck, the patio furniture was stained with dirt and the chairs around the fire kept getting loose. I was so disappointed in the outdoor space and felt like we didn’t really get to enjoy it because it was so not well kept on the outside. I totally get bugs and dirt exist but for the price, I would have expected more upkeep. In my opinion, this place has too much hype for what it was."
240,4,My boyfriend & I had an AMAZING time! The property is beautiful and it made for a very memorable weekend. I would definitely recommend staying here to anyone thinking about doing it!
241,4,"Cannot say enough good things about our stay. It was the perfect little getaway and very close to everything in Charlotte. The tree house was very clean and well taken care of. If you’re on the fence, or wondering if it’s worth the money, I recommend booking!"
242,4,Such a magical little place! We enjoyed every minute of our night in the treehouse. This is the perfect staycation for any couple needing to take a break from the chaos at home and just reconnect in the most beautiful and relaxing settings. Highly recommend.
243,4,Amazing stay at the treehouse! I was in complete zen mode the moment we checked in. Bonus? Only 15 minutes from the heart of Charlotte!
244,4,"We had a great time for our anniversary trip. We loved spending time outside, we fished, and relaxed on the outside bed most of our stay. We saw lots of animals and we loved the heron that flies over! The airbnb was very clean and cute. Very happy with out stay here!"
245,4,"Beautiful and magical! You feel like you’re in the middle of nowhere but still have convenience to uptown.
Best sleep I’ve had in a very long time.
The record player was a bonus!"
246,4,"We loved our stay at the treehouse- it was just perfect to unwind, unplug and enjoy some quiet time away from our sweet kiddos. This spot could not have been more perfect- conveniently located in Charlotte, so close to home yet we felt miles and miles away. Thank you to Alyssa & Brian for creating such a beautiful home for a quick escape. Would highly recommend it!"
247,4,This place amazing and so cozy !!!
248,4,Perfect staycation! I would highly recommend this to everyone! I’ll be back for sure.
249,4,"Fun place to fish and just hangout by the water to drink some beer. Loved the outdoor bed, especially the night it rained…so peaceful! Great getaway for our little anniversary trip!"
250,4,So cute and cozy! The perfect “staycation”.
251,4,Absolutely loved my time at the unique treehouse - it was such a perfect little spot!
252,4,A true gem right outside the city. It was so romantic and the perfect place to celebrate our anniversary. The pictures don’t do it justice and the vibe is magical. Highly recommend!! We will definitely be back.
253,4,This treehouse is amazing!!! It is somehow secluded and private while being so close to Charlotte. When you are there you feel like you are in the middle of no where and able to relax and enjoy the atmosphere but you can also run into Charlotte simply to get a cup of coffee with its location. I would recommend this place to anyone & can’t wait to make it back.
254,4,"Words and pictures don’t do this place justice. I booked this treehouse to spend my birthday eve because I had been wanting to come here since i learned about it a year and a half ago. It is exactly as described — a scenic, private getaway nestled in a residential area. When you’re here it feels like you’re far away from the rest of the world. Just remember that you’re out in nature, if you’re going in the summertime bring bug spray for mosquitoes! (we realized there was a can of spray in the drawer just right before we left, but after we had went and bought some because we forgot ours lol). I played a couple of records, but also used it as a Bluetooth speaker. Next time I’ll bring some of my own records as well. It rained at night but we still spent the evening cuddling on the bed swing listening to the rain and nature around us and it was euphoric. The bed was comfortable, outdoor shower was a beautiful experience, and waking up to the views from inside the treehouse on the morning of my birthday was unmatched. Next time I hope to be able to stay longer, use the fire pit and the grill, and maybe even get out and row on the lake. Thank you for this amazing experience!!"
255,4,Was very accommodating and the place was in perfect shape. Overall excellent experience !
256,4,Thank you so much for sharing this sweet blessing with us. We cannot wait to send our friends to enjoy this place.
257,4,"The outside space is amazing! The deck, fire pit area, and dock were all beautiful and even nicer in person than they looked from the photos. We had such a fun time exploring the pond and making smores!"
258,4,This treehouse was the perfect get away for my husband and I to celebrate our anniversary/baby moon! It is just as stunning in person as it is in the pictures! We loved how we were tucked away to ourselves but also very conveniently close to anything you could possibly want or need! I would highly recommend this place to anyone!
259,4,"This place is amazing! The house by the lake and the surroundings, a place to disconnect and reconnect!

Definitely an awesome experience! The hosts were kind to let us have a wonderful picnic 🧺 and had a great time!

The decor was lovely, bed was comfy and location was close to many things, shops food, downtown, etc.

Would definitely recommend this treehouse!

Thanks again for letting us have this experience!"
260,4,"Super cute, fantastic location, and everything was as advertised! My girlfriend and I were extremely happy with our weekend getaway here."
261,4,My husband and I stayed in the treehouse shortly after our wedding for the first part of our honeymoon. The treehouse was absolutely adorable! So quaint and cozy. The description was extremely accurate. We just wished there had been coffee for the coffee maker. I would absolutely recommend anyone to stay here looking a place to unplug and getaway. Alyssa was also super sweet
262,4,This place is exactly what you see! It’s so peaceful and beautifully done.
263,4,The Carolina Treehouse is the perfect place if you are looking to unwind near Charlotte. It is such a serene setting that you forget you are only a few minutes away from the city and all of the great food and activities Charlotte has to offer. My wife and I can't wait to book this place again.
264,4,Pictures do not do it justice!
265,4,"Perfect little getaway! In the woods, but not far from town. Every little detail is what makes this place extra special. We enjoyed putting on a record and just relaxing together. We can't wait to stay here again!"
266,4,"Perfect spot for a romantic getaway! Alyssa and Brian were easy to get in touch with, instructions were clear, spot was perfect! No complaints at all! We spend some time in Noda which was a 10 minute Uber drive away. We look forward to coming back in the future!"
267,4,"Oh where do I start?! This rental is a hidden gem. The attention to detail is impeccable. From the Bluetooth enabled record player, to the leather bound journals with personal notes left by visitors. It was exactly what I was looking for to celebrate our 20th anniversary. He likes camping …I prefer the Ritz. This is a pleasant medium.
It was clean and ready for our arrival. Directions were perfect…read them before you arrive or you will surely be as confused as we were when we arrived to an empty lot. You would never know it is tucked away in a neighborhood. Close to everything but when you walk down the solar lit walkway, you are the only ones there. Perfect! Upon arrival we enjoyed a picnic of fresh fruit and cheeses by the fire pit. My hubby was surprised and wouldn’t stop smiling.
The outdoor shower was an adorable touch for me and took hubby out of his comfort zone. He ended up loving it…now I’m going to have to keep an eye out when we return home! Lol!
For our anniversary, We dressed in formal black tie attire and I hired a private chef to come cook a delightful four course dinner. Elite Events with Chef Terry did an outstanding job cooking crab cakes, fried green tomatoes, lobster mashed potatoes, perfectly seared and tender lamb chops and broccolini. He served us peach cobbler for dessert before cleaning up and leaving us to enjoy a beautiful dinner at the best seats in the house. The view was so romantic. We also hired an amazing photographer (Take the Shot Portraits-Rachael Hynan) who captured our special memories and the beautiful surroundings. We had everything we needed. No tv. No cell phones. Perfect lighting and atmosphere.
The indoor space is small and cozy. Don’t pack heavy…I’m not much of a minimalist, but definitely didn’t need as many things. The hosts had a lot of things there already. If you go out and won’t be returning until after dark, turn on some lights! It gets dark back there until you turn on a few of the lights. It is beautiful in the day and night. We would highly recommend it and would love to stay again in the future."
268,4,Such a fun place! We had a blast!
269,4,My husband and I stayed for our anniversary! This treehouse is a must. We absolutely loved it! You would have no clue your just 15 minutes from downtown Charlotte. Everything about it was amazing! We will definitely be back!
270,4,Beautiful place
271,4,"We had a wonderful time for our anniversary trip! My husband and I would 100% recommend this home for a relaxing, peaceful getaway. The in-ground deck hammock, record player, outdoor bed swing, trendy decor, and fire pit all make for a fun experience."
272,4,Super cute little treehouse! Perfect for a weekend getaway.
273,4,Truly one of the most unique places and experiential stays in Charlotte. It just goes to show you can get a little bit of everything here in Charlotte. Not to mention it was very romantic 🥰.
274,4,Lovely getaway hidden close to anything you could want to do in uptown Charlotte! Really enjoyed the view…two massive great blue heron we had the pleasure of watching…even a deer across the pond at the waters edge. And the last night a beautiful rain storm… So rejuvenating to be surrounded by the light filtering through the green leaves of the trees:) A slice of heaven!
275,4,If you’re contemplating booking this Airbnb - just do it! It was so beautiful and unique. It was nice to sit my the fire pit or lounge on the outside bed and watch the geese. It’s also super close to EVERYTHING while feeling secluded. Will definitely book again :)
276,5,Great stay!
277,5,"Justice was very attentive and even checked in to see if he could bring us anything during our stay. This was a once in a lifetime experience and a great bonding opportunity. The place was absolutely gorgeous, clean, and comfortable. The shower and toilet were easy to use and the shower water heated up to the perfect temperature. There was also fire wood along with items to grill food. We loved the cooler because you could set the temperature and it cooled down very quickly. The bed was very comfortable and we didn’t even need to turn on the heat (although it worked very well). If you’re looking to make the place you stay part of your experience then this is the perfect get away. We also went to Asheville which was only about a 20 minute drive."
278,5,"Such an incredible stay!! Peaceful, private and beautiful! We had a fire each night and waking up to the sunrise in the cozy dome was unforgettable! Justice was so helpful and friendly. Everything was very clean!! We will be coming back again!"
279,5,"We had the best off grid getaway at Justice’s dome!! It is so nicely set up, comfortable, and a great experience for those who want to disconnect from the hustle and bustle. We wish we would have stayed for a few more nights- we loved it!"
280,5,"What an amazing special getaway for our 15th wedding anniversary! Super unique space, quiet, and completely off the grid. We were able to unplug for a few days and just relax! Justice was super responsive with all my questions. Definitely recommend and can’t wait to come back!!"
281,5,"Justice takes great pride in making the process as simple as can be, but will answer any questions very quickly. It is a great location to go and be in your own oasis away from the busy city and technology."
282,5,It was great!
283,5,Such a beautiful off the grid location. Definitely would stay here again and recommend this place for a couple who wants to get away a few days.
284,5,Cozy and fun stay near Asheville!!
285,5,"The Serenity Mountain dome was beautiful and in a great location comfortably outside of Asheville. The owner Justice was communicative and allowed for a flexible check in.
The only things I would change about the dome is to enclose the bathroom during the winter because we were freezing our butts off. And also expand the perimeter of the electric fence so that it is not quite so close to where guests are sleeping and living."
286,5,Such an amazing getaway! The dome was absolutely beautiful and everything we expected. It was so clean and aesthetic. We really enjoyed the views. Thanks Justice!
287,5,"Wonderful stay! Beautiful surroundings, and unreal dome. Should definitely be a bucket list trip! I promise there’s nothing like it! Justice is super communicative, and there is a tablet inside with crystal clear instructions and tips for the dome. Great place to reset!"
288,5,"We had such an amazing and restorative get away at the dome!! So quiet and peaceful with all the basic glamping essentials!! Would recommend to any couple, friends vacation or anything really! Quite an impressive off grid oasis!! Let Justice treat you to a true escape!"
289,5,"This little getaway spot is perfect for couples looking for a cute little hideaway spot !! Perfect for any and all occasions (we were celebrating my birthday and valentines). Everything looked exactly like the pictures provided. I had a few questions for the host and he was very responsive and helpful and gave very detailed instructions for everything. Although it’s a nice spot it is still in nature so be prepared for anything and bring some back up supplies (extra wood, blankets, portable charger, etc.). We had such a relaxing night and enjoyed the fire in the peace and quiet. We will definitely come back when we can stay longer and can’t wait to see any updates that’s made!!!


P.s- if you go anytime that it’s rainy or very wet be mindful and it’s best to drive a bigger veichle or one with 4WD as I have a Toyota car and almost got stuck on the gravel road there!"
290,5,Would stay a million times over again.
291,5,Very nice location that is super quiet and relaxing! Perfect for a quick getaway!
292,5,It was an amazing get away. You should try this place out. :)
293,5,"We thoroughly enjoyed our escape to the mountains in this private, peaceful and secluded dome experience. Justice was very easy to get in touch with and very helpful the entire length of our stay! We had a wonderful time."
294,5,"Beautiful, quiet place away from the hustle of Asheville. Justice was an amazing communicator and quick to respond."
295,5,Great place for a scenic mountain get away!
296,5,"Amazing place, definitely off grid so be ready for glamping to an extent. Want to come back when it’s warmer out for campfire weather!"
297,5,"It was a great way to bring in the New Year it was great quiet spot very private. And close to tons of places to go. Packs Tavern is an awesome place to eat in Asheville. Recommendations: if it rains or is cloudy you won’t have power so bring battery packs and lanterns, also extra blankets, we had a cooler to keep food because when the power is out the fridge does not work. Also bring extra towels because the toilet gets soaked when it rains. But if you have in mind these things can happen before going you will be great. It’s an awesome experience we played cards and watched movies on our tablet. We had perfect phone signal. Over all we would do again."
298,5,It was a great little romantic get away spot! Thank you!
299,5,"Our stay at the Dome was amazing. The area was beautiful and serene and private. Our only issue was the weather, which was outside of anyone's control. Highly recommend staying but keep in mind the description is accurate; it's off grid so you will need to know what you are in for and be prepared. Justice was very communicative, helpful, and friendly throughout."
300,5,This was an amazing place to stay! The most unique place we could have picked. Host was very hospitable and quick to answer. Definitely worth a trip for the amazing views you get from the dome.
301,5,"We had the BEST baecation getaway! Highly recommend. We didn’t want to leave, but we’ll most definitely be back! Justice was also a great host. Very responsive and accommodating to any needs or questions we had. 10/10 experience."
302,5,Justice has fast responses to my questions and he was very kind! The dome was absolutely amazing everything was so clean and it came with almost everything you need for a perfect glamping adventure such as paper towels tin foil utensils dish soap etc.. the grill with a stove top was extremely handy and the two fire pits! Me and my husband spent hours in the hammock basting in the beautiful mountains! It gets pretty chilly at night so back mindfully!
303,5,"We had a wonderful birthday getaway! You really get the feel of sleeping in the woods with all the comforts of home at this dome. You are secluded, but still close enough to all the things the Asheville area has to offer. This is truly something unique and we will be recommending it to others for sure."
304,5,"We loved our stay! It was very peaceful and had everything we needed and was clean. The host was super responsive and helped with any questions we had. We loved exploring the area, hiking, grilling, and seeing Asheville. We definitely recommend this place!"
305,5,We had a great time. It was a relaxing place and change of pace from hotels and being in town. Beautiful place on the inside side and outside and very clean. Loved the feel of being in the wooded areas in the mountains. Very quiet and peaseful. Justice was a top knotch host and responded to all of our messages very quickly.
306,5,"This is a fantastic place to stay. The wood burning stove kept us warm in Mid November with temps dropping to the low 40’s. It is a great location and very secluded, yet easy to get to town for supplies or food. Justice was very quick with answering a few questions. Highly recommend this stay."
307,5,"Host is very accommodating and very easy to get in touch with if needed. If you’re looking for a cute, cozy, and private spot this is your place!"
308,5,Thank you Erica!
309,5,This was a unique way to camp and we really loved it. Would definitely visit it again. Very secluded but still easy to access everything Asheville has to offer.
310,5,"Thank you, Joshua!"
311,5,"This place was amazing, definitely an experience I would recommend everyone try at least once! You are close enough to Asheville for food/activities but far enough away to feel secluded in nature.

Highly recommend for a romantic getaway! Justice is a great host, very responsive and attentive to detail.

Everyone should experience this property!"
312,5,Thank you Donald!
313,5,Amazing stay and great experience!
314,5,"Such a special space! Definitely way more comfortable than tent camping but with the same good private nature getaway feel. Cozy and warm at night with the wood stove. Absolutely nothing can beat the stars out here! Very private space, great host, perfect location."
315,5,What a great place to reset and relax. We had some issues with the solar energy (we were the first guests) but our host reponded quickly. Would definitely recommend if you're ooking for an off grid experience!
316,6,"Everything was great at the treehouse! Small, cozy, and cute. Very clean and peaceful."
317,6,We had a fantastic time!
318,6,My teenage daughter and I had a fantastic time at the Tree House! The space was cozy and comfortable. We especially loved the outdoor shower (attached to the Treehouse) and the fire pit. It was the perfect getaway. Thank you!
319,6,"This was my second visit here and, yet again, I wasn’t disappointed! I brought my family this time and my elementary age kids thought it was the coolest adventure. Tim is on top of everything and this tree house is beautifully built. A true NC gem. We will be back!"
320,6,"Wow again. What a perfect get a way for a girls night. Burgers on the grill, warm fire for hours, stars, moonlight and peace and quiet. Amazing treehouse and amazing hosts. Tim is awesome. Bed is super comfortable and the porch is perfect for a sunset and enjoying your morning coffee. This place is less than 30 minutes from my home and I feel like I'm hours away in the mountains. I give it a 10 again from start to finish!!!"
321,6,"Treehouse, Tim is an incredible host, and the stay was absolutely fantastic! He was super responsive, and always there to check in on me! I loved the outdoor shower, which got hot water very quickly, all of the cute and homey touches in the place! It was a little too rainy to use the fire pit, but it looks like a great place to have a wonderful bonfire with family! Easy to find, and a lot of restaurants in town within a 20 minute drive!"
322,6,The treehouse was a beautiful and romantic night away from the everyday hustle and bustle of life. We got to focus on us and have fun like we did when we were dating. Best weekend getaway in a long time. The house is beautifully decorated and the shower was amazing even with the cool night breeze. You definitely have to enjoy a night out by the fire pit. I’m sure we will be back!
323,6,"Tim was great and so was the Crooked Shutter Tree House.
An enjoyable experience and we will be going back!"
324,6,"Great place!!! Nice location, the best host!


We were missing oven in the kitchen , but it is a tree house, u can not have it all!

And there was a microwave !

We cooked on the fire outside and the host provided us with the wood!"
325,6,Amazingly unique stay!
326,6,"We had a wonderful stay in Tim's treehouse! It was in a beautiful location in the woods and was so much fun! A perfect size for a getaway with everything you could need. It ended up raining but we were still able to build a fire in the fire pit and roast marshmallows for s'mores - we weren't going to let a little rain dampen our fun! The bed was extremely comfortable and having coffee in the morning while watching the deer graze right outside of the windows was a highlight! Thank you again, we hope to be back soon!"
327,6,"Loved staying in the Treehouse with my family. Beautiful, peaceful retreat with everything we needed for a one night getaway."
328,6,Tim’s treehouse is super cozy and we loved the fire pit! Lots of good birding from the porch and property! We brought a gas camp stove and cooked dinner outside on the picnic table. It was perfect!
329,6,"Loved our stay at the treehouse! Great attention to detail, and Tim was always responsive."
330,6,"I came here with my daughter for a mother/ daughter getaway before she goes off to college. It was perfect for the two of us. Ive stayed in a lot of rental homes and this one by far was the most thoughtfully designed space with clear directions for everything you could imagine. We texted Tim a few times with small questions and he was more than happy to be helpful, cheerful and kind. Thanks for openkng up this unique amazing space to share with others. Its truly a gem!"
331,6,"Treehouse Tim,

We had the most perfect , relaxing, peaceful stay at your treehouse. It was just as we hoped it would be but even better!! It was very clean, comfy, and so perfectly decorated! The loft was my favorite. The view from up there is amazing!! For anyone wanting to escape the hustle & bustle of everyday life this is the place to be. Simple put, just good for your soul :)

Thank you so much,
Jacki & Martha"
332,6,"The Crooked Treehouse was a perfect getaway. So beautiful, and we were very impressed with the use of space. It didn't feel cramped and there was so much natural light it made it cozy and welcoming. They really went above and beyond with the instructions for everything. We will definitely be back to this little oasis."
333,6,"Tim place was great, I would stay again but I wouldn't bring my 4 kids just 2kids..Nice architecture of a treehouse."
334,6,This was our second time staying at the tree house. We had a wonderful stay. We love rocking on the front porch and sitting by the fire. There is so much to do in the area. Thank you Tim for providing a peaceful place!
335,6,We had such a great time at The Crooked Shutter Treehouse. It was perfect for a quick little family get away. Everything was exactly as described and pristinely clean. We really enjoyed the craftsmanship and the decor. Watching the sunset from the rocking chairs was gorgeous and we had a lot of fun roasting hotdogs and making s’mores around the fire. My absolute favorite part was the outdoor shower (even in February). We’ll definitely be back next time we’re in the area!
336,6,We loved our time at the treehouse! Definitely will be coming back again!
337,6,It’s been on my bucket list to stay in a treehouse and what an incredible treehouse this was!! The property was beautiful and the place was so well designed with great attention to every detail! I loved watching the sunset on the rocking chairs on the porch and trying out the unique outdoor enclosed shower. What an incredible stay!!
338,6,We loved staying in Tim’s treehouse! Our kiddos are really itching for their own now!
339,6,"Loved gazing at the trees through the crooked windows, very peaceful and surprisingly spacious!"
340,6,We simply had a fantastic time!! We wanted an adventure and the treehouse seemed so intriguing. We were NOT disappointed!! Everything was spectacular. Such a great place to escape and decompress for a nice long weekend. Thank you Treehouse Tim for sharing your Crooked Shutter Treehouse with my daughter and me. We will remember it always.
341,6,"I can't express in this short review how much we absolutely loved staying here!!! This secluded gem makes you feel like you are FAR away from the chaos of every day life, BUT so close to everything you need! Tim was an excellent host! We will DEFINITELY be back!! ❤️❤️"
342,6,The treehouse was great. I love the attention to detail and the easy to find/read instructions. Everything was clean! The squirrels rustled in the leaves all evening! 😊 We would recommend.
343,6,"We absolutely loved our stay! There were great instructions throughout the house, Treehouse Tim was so communicative, and the treehouse was so charming. It was perfect for a few a little getaway, and the rain on the rooftop at night made it so cozy. We would definitely come back again!"
344,6,"This was absolutely what we needed! This treehouse is beautiful, we wished we could have stayed longer. It was real cozy and a perfect getaway. Thanks, Tim!"
345,6,Very surreal and peaceful cabin. Had an amazing time living like a bird in the trees
346,6,"Beautiful gem! Much larger than the treehouses I had stayed in before and cute as can be inside! The bed was so comfortable! The outside shower was our favorite part. We'll be back for sure. The firepit looked so inviting, but we just had a quick evening after work.
You Definitely Want To Rent This Treehouse!!"
347,6,"A really great place for a quiet, peaceful stay for a few days. Very relaxing to be among the trees and relax by the fire pit. I would absolutely stay here again."
348,6,Wouldn’t have changed a thing on this trip. Tim was a great host and the treehouse is a perfect place to call home for a weekend getaway!
349,6,"My family and I had an amazing stay, it was our first time using Airbnb, and our first time ever staying in a tree house, and it was a great experience. Everything was spotless clean! Like every other post have said, Tim is very responsive and a great host and he has done an amazing job with the tree house and making it an unforgettable experience. Fire pit was great, the views from the the porch and rocking chairs were great. Outdoor shower was a hit with the kids! We thought it would be too cold to use, but even with it being cold outside, the shower was still nice and hot. We will be back for sure! 10/10"
350,6,Loved it. Would recommend
351,6,"The owners left no detail forgotten! They thought of most any and every thing you would want or need. I was so impressed. My family enjoyed playing board games, fire pit, porch rockers at sunset, outdoor showers, and closeness to civilization at the same time. I couldn’t have been more impressed with the owners and their attention to detail and attentiveness!"
352,6,This was a great stay for us as we were looking for a peaceful get away from home that wasn’t too far out from where we lived. Getting there and checking was very easy thanks to the very clear instructions on the door and on the emails. Check in and check out times were very reasonable. We thoroughly enjoyed the stay at the treehouse and would recommend to anybody looking to try something new.
353,6,"This was one of the best Airbnbs we have stayed in! Our kids LOVED it! It was beautiful, quiet, incredibly clean, very comfortable and the views were fantastic! We cooked dinner over a fire, played games, had coffee on the porch overlooking the evergreens and enjoyed our peaceful family time! The outdoor shower was super cool also! Tim was a wonderful and responsive host, and he did such a wonderful job crafting this tree house! It was even decorated for Christmas! We will absolutely be back!!!"
354,6,"We had an amazing time at Crooked Shutter Treehouse. The treehouse was beautiful and it was everything we hoped it would be for our New Years weekend. Tim was very responsive when we needed extra wood for our outdoor fire pit. The outside shower was a hit and a real awesome touch, very refreshing. Overall this is a five star AirBNB and our favorite AirBNB yet. We will be coming back for sure."
355,6,Tim's treehouse was everything as described and more! Even the beautiful pictures can't do it the proper justice. Sitting on the porch rocking chairs watching the sunset over the tree tops was just magical. The treehouse itself has everything we needed. With my daughter having dietary restrictions we had to fully cook everything at the treehouse and it worked out perfectly. They have truly thought of every detail in this treehouse and it shows throughout the entire property.
356,6,"This treehouse is such a unique find! I truly felt like I was in the mountains with the full pine trees looking out over the deck. Breathtaking, cozy and warm! It had everything we needed and then some. The space heater was perfect for the floors in addition to the central heating. Easy to find! Coffee with a view, never felt more at peace. 10/10"
357,6,"Beautiful and peaceful. Fun for our family of four. Easy to cook a light meal or breakfast. Quick ride to Charlotte and other restaurants in the area. Next time we hope to explore Lake Norman, but we need that warm North Carolina sunshine! It was too cold for this Christmas trip. Always MAGICAL!!!"
358,6,The treehouse exceeded expectations. Such a great place to stay the night. The house was clean and very well decorated. The outdoor shower with it 30 out was great as well
359,6,"I love the treehouse! Outdoor shower was probably my favorite thing, it’s a wholesome experience!"
360,6,"The tree house was such a cozy and comfortable getaway! The surroundings are peaceful and lovely, the beds slept great, and I loved all the detailed instructions—very helpful. Would love to go back!"
361,6,It was our first time staying a treehouse and we absolutely loved it!!!
362,6,"I can’t say enough good things about this treehouse! It’s so modern and beautiful, inside and out. Waking up, the first thing I saw was a beautiful and endless sea of pine trees. As I turned around to check out more of my surroundings, I was lucky enough to see not one, but four deer! You really feel like you’re in the middle of nowhere, it’s incredibly peaceful. Treehouse Tim was so welcoming and nice, there was always clear and open communication. I only wish our stay could have been longer!"
363,6,"We came to the tree house for my boyfriend birthday and it was a really beautiful place to spend the day, Tim was a really nice person, we hope to come back soon :)"
364,6,Thanks for a great stay Tim! My friends never stayed in the woods and your place really blew their minds. We loved all the special touches and creativity- like the descriptive pictures and tilted mirror in bathroom. We hope to come back in the future.
365,6,"Cozy and comfy place for a getaway. We enjoyed the solitude, the rockers on the porch, and the deer wandering through. Limited kitchen/cooking options as shown in photos and description, so best to plan ahead as to whether to bring food or plan on going out."
366,6,"The sunset from the rocking chairs steals the show. But just barely, the outdoor shower was incredible. It was so cozy and lovely."
367,6,"First time staying in a treehouse was a great experience. Clean doesn’t even describe the treehouse, it’s spotless. It’s got everything you need, Tim was great. We will be back! Couldn’t recommend more, would give this 10 stars!"
368,6,"Tim’s treehouse made for a great stay in a very cool unique spot. We definitely appreciated the build of the house and Tim, the host even brought us a lighter and fire starters."
369,6,"Tim’s treehouse was an amazing place to stay in the Denver, NC area. We stayed with 2 adults and 1 teenager over thanksgiving while visiting family in the area and were very happy and comfortable there. The space is clean and quite and the surrounding area was peaceful and pretty. We didn’t get a chance to use the fire pit since (but it looks awesome!) and we really enjoyed the outdoor shower (very unique and nice hot water). Definitely would stay here again when we come back to visit the fam!"
370,6,"I thought that there were two loft beds. But it was the same bed different linens.
Everything was beautiful. Couldn't of been more perfect, we loved it. Gorgeous views. The sign with the green tree is very helpful to see it ahead to turn especially in the evenings. Loved the outside shower, very refreshing. The loft bed very comfortable. Loved rocking chairs on porch. I coukd go forever. Highly recommend! Look forward to going again our next trip out!
Abigail"
371,6,We had a wonderful stay at the tree house! Everything was well thought out and such an amazing experience! Can’t wait to stay again!
372,6,We went for my sons 11th birthday and I couldn’t have asked for anything more perfect.
373,6,Loved staying at Crooked Shutter Treehouse! Peaceful and secluded getaway in a comfortable and super cute treehouse. Tim was helpful and responsive. Will definitely be back!
374,6,"The treehouse was just as expected! A cozy little getaway near Lake Norman. This was the perfect first stop in our road trip. The house sways when you’re in there, giving you a true treehouse feel. We loved it!"
375,6,"The treehouse was clean, looked great, and had plenty of nice features! The price of the treehouse is more than worth it! Definitely a place you dont want to leave after your stay! We will be back!"
376,6,"We had the best time at the treehouse! My 11 year old daughter requested to stay here for her bday and it was perfect! So easy to find, local for us as we live in Denver, it was spotless and the communication was excellent. We’ll be back!"
377,6,What an amazing cabin with such beautiful views. My fiancé and I had a wonderful stay. This cabin is perfect!
378,6,"Beyond amazing! All of the thoughtful touches (first aid kit, binoculars, fire starter, games) made our stay so easy and fun."
379,6,This treehouse is absolutely perfect. We stayed two nights for a little family getaway. Tim was an awesome host and provided absolutely everything we needed for our stay!
380,6,Wonderful stay! We enjoyed it as much as the kids. Beautiful place!
381,6,"This place was a total gem! We were in town for a wedding and wish we would have stayed here longer. The view, privacy and comfort was awesome. We would recommend to anyone and would love to stay here again!"
382,6,"As a little kid, I always wanted to spend the night in a treehouse, so I brought my 2 grandkids, ages 8 and 15, to share this fun adventure with me. We had a blast enjoying the beautiful Fall colors and playing games. For me it was a priceless experience. We can’t wait to come back."
383,6,The treehouse was just as advertised and as pictured. It was very quiet and beautiful during leaf season. Would definitely go back.
384,6,"10 star. Exactly as described. A lovely little treehouse loaded wit h unique details and beautifully decorated space. The front porch is amazing to enjoy your morning coffee, the indoor/outdoor shower is a delight and the firepit provides hours of conversation.

389,6,Amazing place to stay and be connected to nature. Exceeded all expectations. Tim is also a excellent friendly host.
390,6,"Everything was perfect! Hot shower outside in the cold - perfect! Comfortable bed! Great morning views in rocking chairs from the porch - perfect! Couldn’t ask for a better little escape! Close enough to wonderful places to eat, do, etc but far enough away to only hear yourself along with the deer and squirrels. 10/10 will visit again!"
391,6,Perfect. Every time.
392,6,This was a great place to stay! We enjoyed our relaxing time in the tree house!
393,6,Cannot say enough wonderful things about this Treehouse. We have stayed twice and plan to stay many more times. Perfect.

396,6,"Our stay at the Crooked Shutter Treehouse was nothing short of incredible. Communication with the host was wonderful leading up to our stay, and even in the treehouse itself, there are clear helpful instructions for various things. We were never left wondering how to do anything during our stay. The treehouse itself is absolutely amazing. It's nestled in a cute little clearing surrounded by trees, giving wonderful views from the balcony and windows. The inside is cozy, with beautiful wood walls, a comfy loft, and even a heated outdoor shower. The attention to detail throughout the treehouse is immaculate; it was literally a perfect stay. We can't wait to come back!"
397,6,This place is amazing! The attention to detail is apparent everywhere. We loved everything about it and will definitely be back. I would give Tim and the accommodations ten stars if they let me!

400,6,"The Crooked Shutter Treehouse was the perfect way to celebrate my daughter's start of Kindergarten! Tim could teach a course on hospitality. Whenever I thought ""I wonder how to..."", there would be a sign explaining or a cute plaque with instructions I couldn't have asked for anything better!"
401,6,"Amazing. Really enjoyed the peacefulness and tranquility. Felt like we were alone in the middle of no where, but it’s only 5-10 minutes from town. You won’t regret it! Can’t say enough great things about the place. Wouldn’t change a single thing. Best couples retreat ever!"
402,6,This is our favorite Airbnb ever! This was our second stay. It is just so perfect and unique.
403,6,"This mini vacation was exactly what I needed, this will be my new vacation spot from now on! Everything was beyond my expectations! Thank you so much!"
404,6,Absolutely perfect place for our mini honeymoon!!! Very clean easy check in and just felt like we were lost in the woods but still close to the hustle! We had a bon fire and just listened to the soothing sounds of nature!!

Thank you to the “Crooked Shutter Team” for an Awesome experience!"

412,6,"We went out on a limb when choosing to stay at the Crooked Shutter Treehouse and we have absolutely no regrets. Tim, the host was available with a quick response through email.
The listing is accurate and we were thrilled with the location. Before arriving we went into town which is 15 minutes away to pick up groceries. The Crooked Shutter Treehouse is a good way to escape from the every day hustle and bustle.
We highly recommend this place. We stayed for 3 days and it was hard to leave. 🌳🏠
David & Tracy"
413,6,What an amazing first time experience!! Highly recommend the outdoor shower! So unique! Hope to return soon!
414,6,"Perfect. Quiet, tranquil, and not too far removed from anywhere in case you need to pick up something. Cannot recommend this place enough for a quick getaway."
415,6,"We had a great stay at the treehouse! The location is amazing only 30 minutes from the airport, Charlotte the same, and lots of state parks. The treehouse is cozy, we loved sitting on the porch taking in the forest valley view. The campfire area is also very nice. As the kitchenette is just a sink, microwave, and mini fridge I would not plan to do much cooking unless you are adventurous and going to cook over the fire pit. Would definitely recommend this stay for those looking for a quiet, secluded and relaxing Airbnb that is still near a lot of amenities. Tim is a fantastic host and very responsive!"
416,6,"The Crooked Shutter Treehouse was such an amazing stay. Peace and quiet is what I was looking for, and it definitely delivered.
The deck and view were amazing! And the rocking chairs were a perfect touch!
My favorite part was the shower! Open air is such a cool design aspect of the treehouse.
10/10 would definitely recommend!"
417,6,Most amazing experience! The view was so amazing. The sun rises and sets right through the windows near the bed. Such a peaceful getaway!
418,6,"We had a lovely stay in this quiet, serene setting. The treehouse was extremely comfortable, clean, and well stocked. We loved sitting on the deck and watching the sunset."
419,6,We've always wanted to stay in a treehouse! It was the perfect cozy stop on our long roadtrip. A thunderstorm rolled through and it was nice cracking the windows and listening to the rainfall while falling asleep. The woodwork and craftsmanship is amazing. You can tell the owners take a lot of pride in it and its visitors. Loved sitting in the rocking chairs with coffee in the morning taking in the beautiful wooded view. Just wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy it more!
420,6,"Our family of five stopped at the Crooked Shutter Treehouse on our way to Hilton Head Island. We enjoyed the seclusion and beautiful views - the kids enjoyed the loft bed and outdoor shower. It was an amazing and one-of-a-kind experience; much better than staying in a hotel room! The treehouse was clean, well-maintained and simply beautiful. Tim was responsive and a great host. I would highly recommend stopping for visit."
421,7,"Fantastic place! I came to the area for a dog show event and this was the perfect place to stay. This place is clearly newly re-done, everything looks great. Especially loved the bathroom, and porch. Beautiful view!

Honestly I haven’t booked an Airbnb in several years due to a bad experience, but with limited hotel options I decided on Andrea’s place and I’m so glad we did! Could not have gone any smoother! Would 100% return and highly recommend. Already have some family members who are interested in booking here too after seeing the photos!

I currently live in a busy neighborhood but grew up in a more rural setting and it was so nice to be able to experience a slice of that again. Thank you!"
422,7,The cutest little getaway with beautiful views!
423,7,Beautiful property! The views were lovely- so peaceful and quiet. Thanks for a fabulous retreat!
424,7,Definitely a hidden place that makes you forget where you are! I would recommend this more for a couples getaway than a family.
425,7,"What a great cabin! It was spotlessly clean and had all the amenities that anyone could ask for. It’s located in a very peaceful area and is surrounded by nicely mowed green fields. The view of the night sky is amazing. If you are lucky, you might get a fly-by visit from the owner’s adorable dog, Sniffer. Andrea is the perfect host and is very responsive. We will definitely stay here again."
426,7,Great! Very hospitable
427,7,"WOW! Just wow! Andrea has done a remarkable job with this cabin. The view on the front porch is out of this world beautiful. It was so peaceful. We were able to use the fire pit and she provided the wood for us. Anywhere we have stayed prior, we always had to bring the wood (which we would always forget!) The simple gestures of cotton balls, qtips, coffee and plenty of linens were much appreciated. Everything was SPOTLESS upon arrival. Andrea was super responsive and helpful. By far our favorite Airbnb! The bathroom was massive with two sinks and in the shower was two shower heads. No more fighting over the bathroom! Absolutely incredible. Highly recommend!"
428,7,This place is a gem! My husband and I needed a quiet weekend away from all of life’s demands. This place was perfect in every way. Andrea has everything there you could need. The view of Pilot Mountain is beautiful. I cannot wait for more time in this peaceful space.
429,7,"WOW is the best word to describe Andrea’s place! The location is conveniently located not far off the high way but far enough to enjoy the peace and quiet! Arriving we were blown away by the beautiful landscape and view of pilot mountain! Just stunning! The cabin was brand new, clean, and cozy! My favorite part is the luxurious bathroom with enormous shower and two shower heads. We also enjoyed starting a fire in the fire pit and enjoying a glass of wine while staring up at the stars! This place is an experience that exceeded all of our expectations! Andrea was also very friendly and quickly available when we had a question. We are already trying to plan our next trip to this perfect little hidden gem!"
430,8,Wonderful hosts!! Really recommend this spot. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!
431,8,Beautiful scenery and Doug & Jen were very kind and responsive!
432,8,We loved our stay at Raven Rock cabin. Such a unique experience and definitely would recommend if you are looking to disconnect and recharge. The surrounding town of Fletcher is beautiful! 10/10 would love to come back. The owners are very responsive and helpful.
433,8,Awesome spot for a relaxing getaway! Great hiking nearby with some amazing views.
434,8,"Our stay was beyond amazing.
We are from Jersey and were on a week long road trip. This stay was BY FAR our favorite stay out of them all. The views were so beautiful and we made sure to take pictures every night to show our family back home who were equally excited after seeing the air b&b listing. The tiny home exceeded our expectations so much that we changed plans on the fly and decided to only go into town to get supplies and come back to the tiny home to cook a dinner with the amazing view while we had it. The grill and stove top range were perfect for everything we needed and our hosts even came up to change out our propane tank for us. Doug and Jen were so accommodating. We drove our Tesla which was not all wheel drive so it wouldn’t make the trek up the mountain but, they THANKFULLY drove us up when we first arrived and also picked us up the morning we checked out which we were so grateful for. We were able to explore their other cabin as well and let me tell you all of their"
435,8,"We enjoyed our stay here. Relaxing, peaceful- it was perfect. My husband and I had a great stay here- reconnecting and no distractions- definitely will do it again. Doug and Jen were super accommodating- and reached out to us to make everything was great. Thank you for sharing your wonderful place."
436,8,Pictures don’t do this place justice! Hidden gem. You feel as if you’re on a remote mountain top but you’re only 15min from downtown Hendersonville. The cabin itself is very well built and has everything & more to have the perfect “luxury glamping” trip. We will certainly be back to experience different seasons at the cabin! Sitting by the fire with the noise of the cold wind outside and view of the stars over the mountains was a great winter experience.
437,8,"Raven rock is an amazing place to stay for a peaceful get away. Very secluded, although close enough to see their other properties. However, it always felt like we were alone in our cabin. There are multiple towns within 15 or 20 minutes and lots to go if that is what you want to do. The wood burning stove was amazing!"
438,8,"My husband, dog, and I spent two nights here and absolutely loved it! We had the best time hiking during the day, stopping by Sierra Nevada for an afternoon beer, and then cooking dinner on the beautiful porch. The whole cabin was so unique and beautifully constructed. It was sadly too windy for us to use the outdoor firepit, but we loved sitting inside by the warmth of the wood stove. The whole place was also very clean (including the porta potty - definitely the cleanest one I've ever seen)! If you're on the fence, book this place! You won't regret it!"
439,8,Showstopper location! Worth every penny!! Doug & Jen are first class!
440,8,"Incredible location, incredible view, incredible hosts. I can't wait to to come back! It's even more beautiful in person"
441,8,Great place! So relaxing and peaceful we had a great time!
442,8,By far one of the coolest Airbnbs we’ve stayed in! Great views of the mountains and just ~30min from downtown Asheville. We lucked out with beautiful weather and even got to enjoy the fire pit located in what feels like a cave below the cabin. Will definitely be coming back! Thank you Doug & Jen for being such great hosts!! 😊
443,8,"My husband and I with our two dogs loved our stay in this cabin. Beautiful place and the scenery is stunning! It is close by to hiking trails, restaurants and breweries. I would definitely recommend this cabin to our family and friends."
444,8,We really enjoyed our stay! Beautiful views and unique stay :) it was a great place to disconnect and spend quality time together. We went during a very windy and cold time of year but the wood fire stove helps make the place so warm and cozy.
445,8,"This camping cabin is super cute and very unique. We enjoyed our stay.
Winter cold air is mighty fresh on dashes to the portaloo 😆 but totally worth the stay!"
446,8,"We had such an amazing weekend and cannot wait to come back! It was so peaceful and comfortable and the perfect off the grid getaway we needed. The cabin was clean as well as the bathroom. The views were amazing and so nice to wake up to the natural light in the morning. We loved the wood stove and once we got it going it was super warm in the cabin despite being in the 40s outside. We had an AWD which is definitely best so you can avoid the hike up. Doug and Jen were helpful and quick to respond, and they have done an amazing job providing everything needed for a great experience!"
447,8,We loved this place! Hope to return!
448,8,Thank you for a wonderful getaway. I look forward to coming back!
449,8,The host was quick to respond and very helpful in offering a shuttle up the 15-minute hike to the cabin. It would have been a rough hike up the trail in the snow without their help. It was a wonderful weekend. We plan to visit again!!!!! Worth every penny.
450,8,"Great place to stay, so beautiful and peaceful. I would advise packing some cold weather clothing because it can get very windy, and you are also going to want to know how to start a fire."
451,8,We had an amazing stay! We will DEFINITELY book again!
452,8,"I loved staying here, it was beautiful."
453,8,"The instructions are very clear on having AWD, and to add to that, if you are uncomfortable on steep inclines, park at the bottom of the hill as they suggest. It is quite the walk up, but the drive is steep. Well maintained and gravel, no need to bust out the traction boards.

The cabin is absolutely beautiful and exactly as it says in the description - they provided enough firewood for the mild-temperature weekend I was there to keep the cabin cozy and to warm up my coffee on the wood burning stove hearth. They do provide instructions on how to operate their specific model, which I found immensely helpful. The futon was comfier than the bed, take a mattress pad if you like a soft surface for the bed. There are other cabins on site but the way their property is set up, everybody has their own private space in and around the cabin, which was lovely. I'm already planning on my next trip back, highly recommend for a weekend retreat."
454,8,"This place was absolutely beautiful. My boyfriend (now fiancé) proposed to me here which made this place even more special than I thought humanly possible. We are from Florida and the drive is truly not for the faint of heart but is 100% possible due to it being so well maintained. It was extremely quiet, private, and peaceful. Our trip was short unfortunately but that only means we will need to come back soon. This place is so special and I can’t wait to try their other properties as well."
455,8,"We had the best stay. Everything was accurately described and even better than we hoped! Doug & Jen were incredible hosts, so helpful and friendly. We will be back!"
456,8,great secluded little cabin if you want to disconnect from the modern world.
457,8,My husband and I had our mini honeymoon here and it was perfect. Private and peaceful. Perfect distance from downtown without sacrificing privacy. We really enjoyed our stay.
458,8,"This cabin is super cozy and perfect for a romantic weekend getaway.
We enjoyed our stay very much and we would love to return.
The hosts , Jen and Doug, were very good at communicating with us.

Carmenza and Allen."
459,8,I love this quite place to collect my thoughts free from all the usual tourist and hubbub. Clean comfortable and peaceful. Beautiful views and easy to get tooooooo loved it will be back
460,8,"Such a beautiful spot to enjoy some down time! Doug and Jen were great. Checkin was smooth.

The cabin is so wonderful, just the amount of space two people need and the garage door is amazing for views, and enjoying the outdoors while feeling warm and secure inside. Perfect winter getaway!

The outdoor toilet was nice n clean and there was plenty of water to use for drinking/cooking during our stay. The wood stove was also amazing at heating the place;). Would love to stay again and to checkout their other rentals as well! A truly special spot:)."
461,8,Raven rock was such a nice cabin experience close enough to Asheville but still secluded from the world.
462,8,Awesome cabin with incredible view.
463,8,"This cabin was absolutely perfect! If you are wanting a fun, rustic adventure this is the perfect place. The owners were very accommodating and made sure we had everything we needed. Would leave a million stars if i could:)."
464,8,AMAZING adventure and we cannot wait to come back! it's truly breathtakingly beautiful.
465,8,Perfect place to unwind and reconnect
466,8,What a wonderful place to stay and unplug! Great location and responsive hosts.
467,8,"We’ve been all over the US and this is the best Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in! Definitely should be on everyone’s bucket list (the other properties seem amazing too!) The hosts are clearly very thoughtful - Every comfort has been accounted for and labeled or explained, and it’s super clean. The bed is comfortable and the fire in the cabin is soooo cozy and keeps the whole place warm! The view is something out of a fairy tale! An experience we’ll never forget - we’ll be back! Thank you!!!"
468,8,"This place was amazing! Perfect for some solo time in nature and close to many hikes. Doug and Jen were fantastic hosts. Would definitely visit here again. Also, there is a great sunrise view spot which I loved."
469,8,We had an amazing stay at this perfect little cabin. They've thought of everything that you could need. It's also a great location to visit Asheville and Hendersonville.
470,8,"Good for the soul 🔥♥️
The best air bnb I’ve stayed in “out there”

12/10 recommend"
471,8,"Amazing stay and amazing host! very friendly, courteous, and helpful. highly recommended!"
472,8,"So beautiful, even better than the pictures. Will be back."
473,8,"Raven Rock Cabin is magical! It is very charming. Everything about it is AMAZING. The position of the house, the path of stacked stone slabs to get to the house, the natural materials used, the recycled materials used, not to mention and certhe showstopping views. The attention to detail when building this house was incredible. The information about the cabin provided by the owners is accurate and should be read and understood. You need a 4 wheel drive in order to drive to the house. Parking at the bottom is provided if you don't have a 4 wheel drive. The house was very clean. There is a clean port- o- potty. There is an incredible shower area built out of stone slabs. It has a gravity fed hose with cold water only. This is for the brave in the winter but probably refreshing in the summer. If you don't want to do this you there is a propane cooking surface and a grill so..... if you can boil water :) The wood burning stove kept the place very comfortable and warm. There was enough wood for our stay but you can purchase additional wood if needed. There is a solar powder battery pack that runs led lighting and can charge devices. We never ran out of power or got close. There are also solar exterior path lights. They provide lanterns but I would recommend headlamps or flashlights at night. There are some great hiking trails nearby. Hendersonville and Asheville are both very close and fun to visit. Both have great restaurants and brewery's if you want to venture out. We recommend a restaurant called Shine in Hendersonville. Most of the restaurants require a reservation. October is a busy season and I am not sure if this is always the case. The owner's were fantastic at communicating. I can't say enough good things. We had a perfect weekend. The weather was perfect and the leaves were perfect and we were in a perfect place. Thank you for creating such an amazing place."
474,8,"As other reviewers have said, you will not regret coming here. The view is amazing and you can sit in bed in the mornings and look out into the valley. It’s definitely a simple cabin, but its obvious that a lot of thought went into every detail of what is provided and it shows. perfect for an escape from city life or a romantic getaway."
475,8,"Had a great time this place was just what i needed to get away, the view was beautiful and everything was very clean even the porta john"
476,8,"The view is as good as advertised. As is the drop off the back deck 😉.
Jen and Doug were very accommodating.
A nice spot for a couples getaway, but close enough to town if you don't wanna cook all your own meals.
Bring that all wheel drive for the last 1/3 mile, unless you pack ultralight....the hike up is no joke if you've got baggage."
477,8,Everything was perfect
478,8,"Absolutely amazing!
We had a great time. Words can’t describe the beauty and the atmosphere of the cabin. Doug and Jen were amazing hosts."
479,8,"This was truly an amazing trip. My boyfriend and I greatly enjoyed it and so did our dog. He loved exploring the property. This was the breath of fresh air we needed away from the city. We drove all the way from DC to stay and it was so worth it. We loved the recommendations left at the house as well. We went to 12 bones for BBQ, Stone Ashe Vineyards, and we hiked Bear Wallow trail. It was a quick 25 minute drive into Asheville where we went to some breweries and had dinner. This is a great area and so pet friendly. Doug and Jen’s place was the perfect escape from the city, but still accessible to Asheville."
480,8,"Some how this amazing place was better than last time. We booked a longer stay this time and enjoyed every bit of it. The cabin is picture perfect, with its cozy fire place that kept us warm on the couch with the dogs and stunning views. I’m not a morning person, but I found myself waking up before the sun rose to watch it come up and every night we watched the skies change with the sunsets. Cannot wait to come back again!"
481,8,What a peaceful stay! Amazing hosts that were very responsive and did virtual check-ins throughout my stay. A pleasant surprise was the fire pit underneath the cabin which was SO perfect with a little rain drizzle.
482,8,If you are thinking about booking it…do it!! you will not be disappointed. All day long you are surrounded by beautiful views. Doug & Jen made sure we had everything we could of needed. looking forward to visiting again!
483,8,"Great communication, easy check in, and very beautiful cabin, which was spotless and has a gorgeous view of the valley that the pictures online just do not do justice too. Everything in the cabin was as described, it got a little chilly one night and the wood stove was more than enough to warm up the cabin, we even had to open a window. We planned to cook all our meals there and wished we had thought to bring a serving bowl for mixing up stuff like salad and few extra food storage containers and foil for the grill. Sunset was amazing with a big fire going in the firepit, but we could hear traffic noise from trucks and motorcycles on the road below late into the evening. We brought a batterymax thinking we might need to recharge lights, as we usually stay up late, but the lighting supplied from the battery pack at the cabin had plenty of charge even when it rained all day. A very unique location and experience so close to sites, shopping and dining, it was hard to choose what do each day!"
484,8,"Doug & Jen’s place was everything that we needed. A great getaway, surrounded by nature and they thought of every little details that we possibly could have needed while we stayed there. The Jon bathroom was not bad at all! Like going to use the bathroom in nature! We are coming back again for sure! Thanks for being such an amazing host and inspiration! ♥️♥️"
485,8,Very beautiful place. Private. Awesome view. Highly recommend!
486,8,So beautiful!
487,8,Raven Rock is truly a magical place! The sunsets last a couple hours and are constantly changing! The outside showers at the rock structure that we affectionately named “the stone hinges shower” were fabulous! Jen and I can’t wait for our next visit!
488,8,This is as good (or better) than it looks in the listing.
489,8,"Born and raised in New York City when my wife showed me this tiny house on the edge of a mountain with no electricity and a hose cold water source for cleaning dishes and bathing for our vacation stay, I had real reservations. Having stayed there with our two dogs for five days I can say what a treasure and truly gratifying gift it is. If you have the opportunity, do yourself a favor and book this place today! The views are breath taking and the simplicity of the house offer much needed respite from the overstimulating, constantly ‘plugged in’ lifestyle most of us are consumed by on a daily basis. Amazing!!"
490,8,"Wow! Is all we can say about this amazing place! Truly heaven on earth! We can’t say enough about how perfect our stay was.

The views were outstanding, the cabin and out house were extremely clean and Doug and Jen were more than accommodating!

RavenRock will always hold a special place in our hearts!"
491,8,"Wonderful! Great views, great communication, great place to stay."
492,8,We had the most amazing stay! The cabin was impeccably designed and made for the perfect weekend away! The views were incredible and the atmosphere were fantastic! Our dog had the best time exploring the property too!!
493,8,"The views from the windows are better than most of the hikes we've tried nearby. It was amazing to watch the clouds roll in and out while feeling like we were on our own personal mountain. It was neat to see the treehouse nearby on the property, but they weren't close enough that you could see each other. We spoke with Doug and Jen a few times, and they were very nice and super cool."
494,8,"We had an amazing stay at this cabin. The view is unbelievable!! We saw all kinds of wildlife including hawks, butterflies, and even a black bear in the distance. It was so quiet and peaceful at night. I'm usually not a rustic type traveler but the portapotty was so clean and the spring fed water made for a very refreshing shower. We had a great time and hope to return:-)"
495,8,"Great weekend at Raven Rock! The views were incredible. You definitely need 4-wheel drive to climb the hill and would recommend bringing a secondary fan in case the provided temporarily runs out of battery. However, Doug & Jen were very responsive and provided a new battery for the fan as soon as requested."
496,8,"This is a little slice of paradise that they so kindly decided to share with others. Everything provided and even decorated with was super thoughtful and appreciated. I was worried it wouldn’t feel secluded with the other two rentals nearby, but I basically forgot they existed until we walked around one evening with the pups. The recommended hike was also amazing. We already booked our next trip here and can’t wait!"
497,8,"raven mountain cabin was the perfect places to disconnect from the world. it was just what my husband and I needed. the views was awesome. everything was great. I do suggest take a camping shower and filling them up in the morning and let the sun warm them up for a shower, there cold water there. we did and it was great.we definitely will be back. doug&Jen was the perfect host."
498,8,"We had a great stay! The view is so beautiful. Definitely book this trip if you can! Thanks, Doug and Jen!"
499,8,"Like so many others here, this was a stunning 5-star stay. The location of the cabin was incredible. The sun sets over the mountains right in front of the balcony as it's facing west. Jen & Doug really thought through many small details when building this including a solar powered battery + USB connections, small lights strung throughout the cabin, two battery lanterns for using at night/bathroom runs, and small night lights on the stairs outside.

We stayed in mid-July but thankfully it wasn't too hot at night. There is a small battery fan provided, but I would definitely recommend bringing another fan yourself.

The only inconvenience we ran into was the bed/mattress itself. It's a *very* soft mattress and as someone who usually needs a firm one, it didn't feel great for my back. But I'd imagine this isn't an issue for a majority of visitors.

The drive up to the cabin was very steep and not for the faint of heart/2WD owners."
500,8,Great cabin. Amazing view.
501,8,Cannot recommend Raven Rock enough! It is the perfect escape. The views are absolutely stunning and Doug and Jen are communicative and just great hosts overall. We plan on returning to stay again as soon as possible.
502,8,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Raven Rock. Doug and Jen have created a magical place, and they are so generous and hospitable. It is such a healthy thing to sometimes unplug from the cycle of life we create for ourselves. Raven Rock is perfect for doing just that. Waking up to that view in the morning sheds all the stress!

P.S.

Bring a nice comfortable chair so you can lean back and enjoy the view. :)"
503,8,"lovely place. this is one of those places you won't want a to pass by. location is perfect closed to many attractions, stores and vineyards.the view an atmosphere is perfection. well equipped cooking area and a comfortable bed, you'll definitely need a 4wd or owd."
504,8,"The Raven Rock Cabin was incredible, a perfect secluded getaway. As a single traveler I felt safe on their property and they checked in to ensure everything was going well! Couldn’t beat watching the storms rolling in over the mountains next to a fire in the overhang under the house, 10/10 book!"
505,8,"I can't really think of what would make it better other than us bringing our dog next time since the cabin is way bigger than we anticipated.

We have stayed in tiny houses on mountains and seacliffs before and this one is by far the best! Top notch quality, cute decor, and so much space! Spectacular views.

We were amazed at how clean everything was, even the portable toilet. They provide sandals, flickering lamps, and a strong battery operated fan. They made great use of the space, while keeping it roomy. They have solar and motion activated lighting outside, expertly placed so navigating at night was easy.

The fire pit area below was also a big surprise and really could appreciate the care taken to make that area so cozy. We got to sit back on the benches and enjoy the fireworks and rain from afar! Was like having a bird's eye view from our cozy little cave.

We really loved the place and found nothing negative! Will be coming again to check out their tree house and cottage! So cool!"
506,8,"Don’t miss out on the great views and wonderful charm this cabin provides. It’s a great spot to come back to if you’re planning on hiking the mountains of North Carolina. The cabin also provides a level of peace unmatched by its rivals, so it’s no wonder this spot is social media viral! You’re making a mistake not booking this place. I will be back :)"
507,8,"Absolutely worth it! The most beautiful sunset I’ve ever seen, we had such a great time! Here are some TIPS- 4WD or AWD is a MUST!! The hill to hike up is VERY steep!! Even though my husband and I are in good shape and exercise regularly it was extremely difficult carrying things up. Also- bring flip flops (showering, running back forth to the bathroom) last things- battery powered fan (gets VERY hot at night, they provide one but it died the second night it, would be nice to have an extra one on you), Porta potty is very clean!!! I am not a camper and I was so impressed how clean it was, lastly the “shower” is a hose that is on a rock and cold. But we loved all of it, the cold showers, the views, the unplugged experiences! Communication was great and Doug was very kind and attentive."
508,8,The work they have put into this spectacular slice of bliss is quite obvious. It’s truly out of this world. You’re at your own private oasis. Our dogs were happy as clams exploring all the smells and were able to lounge comfortably throughout the day.
509,8,"The is an amazing place to stay!!
Much more than I even expected— the perfect place to send a few days to just relax—— and the view and sunset could not get any better."
510,8,"My husband and I have been to a few “off grid” locations and this was by far the best! The cabin was clean, had everything we needed, and the views were awesome. Plus, the cabin cooled down very nicely at night even during the summer heatwave. It made for a great night’s sleep. We also hiked the nearby Bearwallow Mountain trail that was recommended and it did not disappoint."
511,8,This cabin is so beautifully executed. It is very minimalist in the best possible way. The view is unbeatable and the privacy is great. We look forward to coming back during another season. Great communication as well!
512,8,"Beautiful, unique cabin. I’m not much of a camper and definitely like my amenities, but this was so worth it. The porta-john was very clean and the cabin was immaculate. Spent most of the time on the balcony enjoying the stars. They even had a dog bed for our pup."
513,8,We stayed at both the treehouse and the Ravens Rock cabin and both were amazing!! We we’re able to walk between them and have 2 beautiful places to relax. Absolutely stunning views and an unforgettable experience. Close to town for groceries and all sorts of beautiful hiking. Doug and Jen were great hosts and provided all the info we needed- great communication. We will definitely be back!!
514,8,incredible
515,8,"My husband and I needed this mountain getaway! The view is awesome. The area is very peaceful and calming. We were able to get some much needed rest & relaxation.
Great hosts! Jen was very kind helping us up and down the mountain.
Thank you for an awesome experience!"
516,8,The cabin was very clean! Wonderful stay.
517,8,The most amazing place to get lost. I unexpectedly had to go by myself while my husband stayed behind and it ended up being the best experience. Everything was clean and communication was always quick. My favorite thing was making a fire every night and listening to the wood crackle and the sounds of the surrounding woods with a cup of tea in hand. Would come back again and again.
518,8,Raven Rock cabin was such an amazing stay. The cabin was cozy and comfortable and had everything we needed. The views were beautiful and there were plenty of things to do. I would highly recommend staying here
519,8,Like most have said pictures just dont do it justice !!!!
520,8,Congrats on making it onto Condé Nast!Well deserved
521,9,"it was perfect and a memorable getaway.
we would return to visit LizzyLousFlower Farm for sure
LL you know we had a great time, we want to come back this week!"
522,9,This was beautiful! I would stay here again for sure!
523,9,This hidden gem is great when you want an escape from the city! You can fall asleep by the beautiful night stars and wake up to the rooster crows. I loved the peacefulness of the stay and the clean air. The interior was cozy and clean with a coffee maker and private bath. It was a little tricky to find but Liz provided directions ahead of time. I recommend arriving in daylight if possible and bringing flashlights and snacks. Super cute and would recommend!
524,9,"The property and accommodation was lovely! Close enough to Wilmington and Wrightsville Beach to be easily accessible, but felt very out of the hustle and bustle of the city. Would definitely recommend!"
525,9,Great place to get away to! A very unique stay! Close enough to enjoy the fun of Wilmington and beach as well!
526,9,Elizabeth was super responsive when we had questions and also left an extra blanket for our stay per our request! Definitely will be visiting again!
527,9,"Beautiful stay!! Loved all the farm animals, the outdoor tub and cozy porch :) if you want to sleep in, you might want to bring ear plugs to wear when you’re sleeping - as the roosters and cows are an early morning alarm (I loved it, but recognize some might forget about the noises that come along with a farm stay). Awesome place, I can’t wait to come back in the summer to experience the greenery of the farm!"
528,9,Such a tranquil and uplifting space to spend time. All the furnishings were just right...the outdoor shower was especially lovely. I felt tickled to be tucked in so closely with the many animals. Elizabeth was responsive and attentive to my questions about late check in. Couldn't have been a better experience. Hope to stay here again soon.
529,9,Beautiful scenery and so many animals to wake up to :) Bed is very comfy and host is super prompt in answering questions. Downtown Wilmington is very close. We had a lovely stay :)
530,9,This is a beautiful Airbnb set in the middle of a lively and blooming farm. The bluebella had everything we needed for a restful and restoring time. Sitting on the rooftop reading and watching the sun come up was a delight. The porch provided shading and a space for talking. The open air outdoor bathtub was refreshing and gave us some ideas for our own home in the future. It is clear that the Airbnb has been built with joyful intention and is full of great smelling products made by the owners. Would highly recommend to all.
531,9,"Such a cute place, loved the animals, I definitely wanted to bring the rooster home. The outdoor bath was so relaxing, and the bed was super comfortable! It is a bit of a drive from the airport/downtown, so I would suggest making sure you have your own mode of transportation since rideshare was not coming out that far. Otherwise we definitely enjoyed it and would come back! Thanks again!"
532,9,Amazing
533,9,Thank you for staying with us again Alden. We appreciate your business and hope you make it back to the farm soon!
534,9,Perfect for reconnecting and tranquility =)
535,9,Thank you for staying with us on the farm. We appreciate you choosing the farm and hope you return for another stay.
536,9,Perfect stay & perfect views!
537,9,Thank you for staying with us. You are welcome anytime!
538,9,"What a special little slice of Heaven!! Our stay was lovely, love the Rooftop deck and all the animals, especially Cuddles the piglet!! Elizabeth could not have been a more accomodating host. I highly recommend this Airbnb."
539,9,"Every time we have the pleasure of staying at Lizzie Lou's, it is absolute heaven. This was our third stay in the Bluebelle but because our friends were staying in the Rose we were also able to take advantage of the indoor bathing area and it was lovely!! And there's truly nothing more beautiful than watching shooting stars from the rooftop.
Beautiful experience all around and we cannot wait for our next stay. ❤️ The only problem I see is that now we'll have to pick which one to say in! :)"
540,9,"This home was so lovely! Immediately upon arrival, I was greeted by a sweet piglet and several ducks. No need to set an alarm here - you'll be woken up by the Rooster! I look forward to being back again."
541,9,Amazing stay. Beautiful place.
542,9,exquisite
543,9,It is hard to leave this magical place!
544,9,This place was perfect ! Stayed here for a night while driving down south. It was about a 15-20 minute drive to Wilmington. The experience of being on the farm was the best part.
545,9,"Beautiful little gem away from all the city noises, yet very close to it, if need be."
546,9,"Such a cute and quiet farm. It’s refreshing to be in such a cozy place. Animals were, of course, so adorable. We loved it- B&D Hoggard"
547,9,Excellent place to stay! Fun experience and new exposure to NC!
548,9,"I went to this Airbnb for my “summer vacation” this year, and it was fantastic! The animals are adorable and so entertaining, and the storage container Airbnb was perfect for what I was looking for. My only regret is that I didn’t bring slip-on shoes for going to/from the outdoor bath (which was the coolest amenity!). It was a really great time, and I hope to come back to this Airbnb many times to unplug and relax!"
549,9,"A little confusing to get there, but super cute stay! Right on the farm, not terribly far from the beach. Be prepared to be awoken by roosters and have only a small amount of phone signal. (This worried us if something were to happen but all went smoothly)"
550,9,It was lovely!
551,9,We had a wonderful and very comfortable stay at the farm. Quiet and peaceful and very lovely hosts- really fun time and unique experience!
552,9,"This was the perfect getaway spot! Relatively close drive to the beach (we went to wrightsville & Kure, both within 30-40mins) and the most amazing experience on the flower farm! We absolutely loved seeing the livestock and catching the sunrise/sunset from the rooftop. The outdoor bath was the most magical touch! We can’t wait to visit again!"
553,9,"A cute room to stay and fantastic place to enjoy the sunrise and sunset. I met one of their dogs, Nannie and she was really friendly. For those who have never live on a farm, like me, it took a few moments to get along with the well water, outdoor bath and energetic roosters crowing at 430am."
554,9,We had a wonderful time. Great location and amazing host!! Highly recommend!
555,9,"Such a sweet little spot for our anniversary trip. We enjoyed the best of both worlds! A super cute, quiet farm experience just minutes away from downtown Wilmington. Who knew a shipping container could be so cute and cozy?! We will definitely stay here again whenever we decide to make a trip back to Wilmington!"
556,9,"For context we did the children’s museum, beach and aquarium. The three years old favorite part of the trip was the outdoor tub! The baby pigs were a close second."
557,9,We loved this place! Beautiful country setting
558,9,The Bluebelle was perfect and in a great location for those who are looking for a little getaway. I loved the roof deck and being able to walk to the room and seeing farm animals on the way. I wish I could’ve stayed longer but it was everything I needed. I definitely would recommend this place to others.
559,9,We were so sorry to miss our stay here but Elizabeth was extremely kind and helpful. A+ guest service. We will save this stay and hopefully visit in the future.
560,9,Absolutely awesome place to stay. So close to Downtown Wilmington only about 20 mins or less away. The place was so nice and comfy and peaceful. Absolutely beautiful views. Loved all the plants and animals. Perfect for being in downtown all day to come to this quiet and peaceful place to relax after all the hustle and bustle of the city. Only have wonderful things to say. I highly recommend it to anyone. Just loved it!!!
561,9,Absolutely perfect. The outdoor shower/bath is magical. The bed was super comfy. The porch was amazing. I recommend everyone book a stay at the farm will definitely be back! Cannot say enough good about this place.
562,9,"Lovely Airbnb and very peaceful. Be prepared for a true farm experience, because that is what you’re getting. We enjoyed the outdoor bathtub and the farm views. Flowers were lovely too! Highly recommend."
563,9,Lizzie Lou’s farm Is absolutely beautiful! It is peaceful and picturesque and gives you a little bit of the country just outside of the city. It has all of the basic amenities You would need for just a few days away. The Wi-Fi works great outside and the greenery is just stunning. Would recommend packing light And taking advantage of everything Wilmington and surrounding areas has to offer.
564,9,"Great setting, super peaceful, liked the outdoor tub/shower, too."
565,9,"We really enjoy visiting the farm, one of my favorite air bnbs"
566,9,"Adorable, perfect place for a getaway and time to unwind. Elizabeth was excellent to communicate with, everything was clean and just as described. We will be back! Lovely place and cute animals."
567,9,"10/10 location is 30 minutes to the beach, it’s even more stunning in person
Highly recommended! Would love to stay here again in the future! Super clean, beautifully decorated!"
568,9,"We loved every second of the Bluebelle. The space was awesome and just what i needed, we will be visiting again as soon as possible. The outdoor bath was EVERYTHING."
569,9,"Love staying here! The outdoor shower was delightful, and I loved all the indoor plants! Front porch was cozy, rooftop deck was perfect for breakfast at sunrise. Be prepared to wake up to the call of roosters. Would love to stay again!"
570,9,"This stay is so much fun. The outdoor bath in the evening was absolutely magical. The farm is cute, directions were easy, the stay looks just like the photos. I will definitely make my way back. This stay is about 15 miles from Wilmington, which is perfect. Not hard to find at all."
571,9,This is the destination for quiet and relaxation.
572,9,Adorable place! Loved it
573,9,"This was the perfect getaway! It was so nice to be in such a cozy and calm space. I would tell anyone to stay here. The instructions for check in were easy to follow and communication with Elizabeth made the stay so simple. Waking up to see the sunrise and all the animals in the pasture was the highlight of the stay, and the outdoor bath was a nice touch! I felt so relaxed during the stay and hope to stay again soon. Thank you!"
574,9,"What a lovely, peaceful, charming farm. The hostess was quiet, friendly, and polite. We loved watching the animals and reading the flower books in the morning sun. The drive to Wilmington and the beach wasn't bad at all and it was nice to be away from the crowds. Hope to come back to stay longer next time we are in NC. Thank you!"
575,9,"Lovely little spot to get away and unplug- also perfect spot for photos (the outdoor spa is even sweeter in person.)

Easy check in, got there with no issues with apple maps, close to the beach and restaurants. Stayed here alone and didn’t feel the least bit worried or unsafe.

Loved this place."
576,9,Amazing place beautiful set love the pigs and the cows and a beautiful way to set up a conex box for a tiny house loved it.
577,9,"Relaxing, beautiful, and so worth a stay! 30 minutes to the beach. I was able to use the gorgeous bathtub since I booked the Bluebell— The Rose is the other unit which does not include the bath. The water was plenty warm which was good since I went in February. The aesthetic and tranquility of that outdoor bonus bathroom is amazing. There is a swinging door for privacy and a little latch you can close to lock it. Literally no one else is around though…it is such a quiet, small town. The bluebell room had everything you need. I loved sitting on the hammock swing and listening to the little water fountain and looking at the view. You will definitely hear the rooster crow some, but I loved that. The 3 dogs did bark when I walked into the gated entranced, but they were very cute and nice. Book this place for a unique stay!"
578,9,Absolutely LOVE the bluebell room and outdoor bath. So cute and cozy. Very clean with everything you need for a quick getaway from Wilmington. Waking up with roosters crowing and cows mooing is an awesome change of pace. Oh and the rooftop hangout area 👌🏼 saw a few shooting stars. Will definitely be back!
579,9,"An amazing oasis tucked away beautifully in this wonderful farm, surrounded by cute animals and wonderful coastal air!
You definitely don't want to miss the opportunity of this lovely experience!
(The perfect proposal setting too!)"
580,9,The place is absolutely amazing. Super relaxing and calm atmosphere.
581,9,The perfect get away for 1-2 people!! The bath was the best part along with petting the pigs & cows. I enjoyed every minute there and look forward to my next visit!
582,9,This was the perfect weekend getaway! The space is small but cozy. The roof deck is perfect for stargazing and the outside bathtub was magical. The hosts were very friendly and we didn’t have any issues during our stay. We would definitely return again!
583,9,This was a wonderful place to break the day to day and reconnect with life. Wonderful host and place and would recommend it to all!!
584,9,"Enjoyed our stay here. Outdoor bath while out of the ordinary, was awesome! Loved being on the farm. Would stay again!"
585,9,"Great place to relax! You will probably want to be the type of person who likes the outdoors and nature. The animals are right outside the house. Very cool experience! Only 30 mins from Wilmington. The owner does live right beside the tiny home, which was a little strange to start, but they were quiet and waved when we passed under their home to get to the tiny home. Overall I would happily stay again."
586,9,The farm is 16 miles from downtown Wilmington a fifteen to twenty minute drive max.
587,9,"Best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at! I loved every part of it, from the rooster crows in the morning to the comfy bed. Absolutely beautiful stay! I will definitely come again!"
588,9,"After a really difficult week my boyfriend and I found this little oasis and thought it would be perfect for a little weekend getaway and we were right! They have created such a beautiful and special place to escape the world on their farm and we have absolutely no complaints. The family and animals were all very friendly, and we will 100% be staying here again!"
589,9,Great time ahead. Great animals. Home feeling. Not far from the downtown area. Go here for nice warm stay. Fire place outside and heater inside. Get you some love at Lizzy Lou Family Farm.
590,9,"Took my mom here for an early birthday. This place is so beautiful and peaceful. Wish we could have used the tub, but it was cold and windy during our stay. We will come back during a warmer month and get the whole experience. Elizabeth was a great host a d responded to every need during our stay. The home was nice and cozy. A good place to go to get away from everyday chaos."
591,9,This is an absolutely idyllic setting. I simoky cherish the time here!
592,9,"If you need to get away and relax this place is where to go! My wife and I loved it all. The experience was super amazing. Just from parking and being welcomed by a beautiful pig strolling around to the private tub at night which is just a beautiful set up. It was all just super peaceful, we felt so at ease here. The host was also super amazing! We couldn’t have thanked her enough. We will be back!"
593,9,Don’t hesitate to book a stay here! It was such a wonderful experience! I plan on coming back when I can!
594,9,"Perfect place for a romantic getaway. Close enough to Wrightsville and downtown Wilmington to make the trips in painless (about 18 minutes to downtown, 25-30 to Wrightsville); far removed enough to enjoy the peace of the farm. We loved the animals, the room was cozy without feeling cramped, and the outdoor shower/bath was a real highlight. Everything in the space was thoughtfully cultivated and arranged. There was so much personality and care put into the decoration and design; the space didn't feel like a soulless Instagram photoshoot. We loved our stay, the farm made a wonderful impression on us, and we look forward to returning at some point."
595,9,Suchhh a cute little getaway! My husband and 2 year old + myself booked a night here just to get away and hangout outside. We loved it. Will be back
596,9,Would recommend this Airbnb to anyone who wants the best time away in the country. Staying on the farm and waking up to the roosters was a dream! I personally loved being surrounded by the farm animals and the beautiful flowers!!
597,9,Very clean and beautiful. Sweet animals. Bed was super comfy! Very quick drive to Wilmington. I could’ve spent the whole stay on the hammock chair. Very nice hosts!
598,9,It’s A Great Little Place That’s So Unique and Fun To Experience!
599,9,"That teeny tiny place was such a relaxing and peaceful place for our two days escapade. If possible I’d give for the cleanness not 5 stars, I’d give much higher than that. The kitchen is maybe much more for serving already prepared snacks etc and not for cooking but in only 20-25min. distance there a lot of delicious restaurants to enjoy. The hospitality from Elizabeth and her family with including all the animals was incredible. Even the cows and the goat called as friendly welcome. I loved the decoration all around with the fresh flowers. The bath should be a great experience with a open view to the nature. We loved the place and would definitely recommend to everyone 💜🌺🌿🌱🍂🍃🐖🐐🐈🐓🐾🦔🐿🪵🌞"
600,9,A very cool and unique stay!
601,9,VERY SMALL BUT PERFECT!! This unit is extemely small but absolutely beautiful and fit our needs perfectly. We used the unit for sleeping only so it made it the perfect fit for us. The outdoor shower was an amazing experience! Even the little frog hopping out of the faucet made it that much more magical
602,9,All the fun of living on a farm without the hard work. This stay was very idyllic from the charming decor to the fairytale outdoor bath. If you’re a lover of flowers and plants then this is a must stay. The upper and lower outdoor seating areas offer two great views. Just a short 20 min drive to downtown Wilmington. The host was very thoughtful as to provide bottled water. I met her very briefly and she was very kind. Great for a night to unplug and have some alone time and would be great as a romantic couples getaway too.
603,9,This is the perfect getaway from the hustle and bustle of life. My wife and I enjoyed our little vacation and look forward to revisiting the farm.
604,9,Water has strong sulfur smell and taste. Did not want to utilize outdoor tub because the smell was so strong. More outdoor seating options would have been a great. There weren’t enough seats on the porch for both my husband and I. I brought an indoor chair outside.
605,9,"Thank you for the feedback Michelle. Being in a rural area the water on the farm is supplied by a deep water well. On rare occasions gasses from can rise with the water causing a slightly unpleasant odor when the faucet is first turned on. I would have loved to have had the opportunity to address this issue with you during your stay to let you know that the smell is a gas and would have quickly dissapated by running the faucet therefore clearing the line. I was relieved to see you did indeed utilize the botted waters proved in the refrigerator considering your apparent level of dissatisfaction. As for the outdoor seating we are sorry that you didn't find the seating to be adequate. With four picnic chairs, two fire pit benches, an upstairs bistro set, hammock chair and sitting stool in the immediate area we thought we had outdoor seating covered."
606,9,"This house was everything we expected and more. Clean, cool, fantastic bathroom! Comfortable bed too. We loved all the sights and sounds that the farm offered, especially for our son who hopes to one day have his own farm!

Great location. A short drive to grocery store or Wilmington. We managed to swim at 4 beaches in 3 days! From farm to city to beach, and back again, great memories were made.

A great getaway for my family."
607,9,"Possibly my best airbnb experience to date. Elizabeth was quick to respond, kind, and gave us our privacy. The space was beautiful, I wouldn't trade this experience for anything. Thank you Elizabeth!"
608,9,"Our stay was wonderful! The pictures matched exactly what we saw in person, very beautiful and the nature around was so pleasant. Elizabeth was respectful of our privacy, but responded quickly if we had any questions. I would definitely recommend!"
609,9,"This was the perfect getaway off the grid. It was just a short drive to Wilmington and the beach, but a nice quiet place to come back and rest. The hosts made really great use of the shipping container space and it didn’t feel cramped or small. We loved seeing the sunrise from the rooftop deck, taking a relaxing shower in the outdoor (but private) courtyard and listening to the roosters in the am.

We will be back again!"
610,9,Nice peaceful place located on a small farm.
611,9,Such a stunning home that comes with a unique experience. It was absolutely peaceful and the views were breathtaking. Elizabeth was incredibly kind and helpful- making our stay so easy & relaxing. Each part of the Bluebelle was decorated beautifully and I really appreciated how clean and comfortable it was :)
612,9,Great place to disconnect from the city life and in tune with nature! We loved seeing all the farm animals! The WiFi is pretty slow we didn’t get phone reception definitely one of those places to be prepared to be disconnected from electronics. We really enjoyed our stay here will definitely come back!
613,9,"You can expect a homey, relaxing, and private stay with a beautiful view"
614,9,"It was a perfect, relaxing vacation for us. Our favorite part was the outdoor shower!"
615,9,"The bluebell was such a delightful stay! We can't think of a favorite part because it was all so great, but some highlights were the adorable decor with tons of plants/flowers, seeing the friendly farm animals, the outdoor tub/shower, and the hospitality of the family. If you're considering staying in the area, this is a great option."
616,9,Lovely small space to stay! The roof top deck is such a bonus. We so enjoyed having coffee up top watching mama hen and her baby chicks mingle among the cows while the sun was coming up.
617,9,What a beautiful stay this was! The farm is so quiet and peaceful. We felt like we were in the tropics among all the gorgeous flowers and plants. Everything was perfectly clean and so nicely decorated. The host/co-host were responsive and helpful. This is definitely a unique and charming space.
618,9,Wonderful stay!!
619,9,Picture perfect!!! You won't be disappointed.
620,9,"I booked this place for my toddler who loves farms and anything outdoors, and it did not disappoint! We stayed here as a family of four with a toddler and a baby for 2 nights and felt very comfortable! The place is small, but with so much room outside to wander we did not feel cramped. Both kids loved seeing all the animals as well as the play set, and very convenient to Wilmington and the beach. Would highly recommend!"
621,9,"This airbnb was so adorable! It was a small space, but just what we needed for a weekend visiting Wilmington / the beach. Seeing the animals outside our window was a delight and the outdoor bath was so nice! My only suggestion to people considering this place is to bring your own drinking water. Overall we loved our stay here and enjoyed being closer to nature and all the animals and beautiful flowers/plants this place offered :-)"
622,9,Very cute and Elizabeth was very prompt responding. If you’re looking for a unique farm stay this is it. The place is small but has everything you need. It was the perfect place to crash one night while exploring the NC coastline.
623,9,"Farm was quaint and quiet, I loved it! It was like being worlds apart, spend the day at the beach, and come relax on the farm! Only thing I’d suggest is bringing your own water to drink. Unless you are fine with well water, maybe it’s a preference thing, I just couldn’t tolerate it. The overall feel is warm and inviting, I’d definitely return!"
624,10,Such a great and easy way to sleep under the stars. We loved it and will recommend it to friends! Wish we'd been able to stay longer!
625,10,"Perfect experience just to relax and get away from it all, only thing missing is hiking trails near by!"
626,10,Incredible experience
627,10,"Me and my roommate had so much, especially the location of this glamp is amazing."
628,10,Perfect spot for those who want to “get away” from the hustle of life. Very peaceful and beautiful scenery. Will definitely be back for a longer stay next time!
629,10,"Pretty simple, you won’t regret it at all. This was an absolute pleasure for me and my partner. You can easily fall asleep to the sounds of the rolling river and the wind swirling through the trees. It’s very nice to wake up to the warmth of a wood stove and to cook on it also. Everything was just terrific!"
630,10,We had a wonderful time staying in the Dome! we spent our anniversary in the quiet and it did not disappoint. We did have a little hick up but the communication was fast and affective. Definitely will be telling everyone about it!
631,10,"I stayed by myself with my dog… it was not intimidating and I was able to find it and get in fairly easily. (I did arrive before it got dark). Being right on the river was great! And even though you could occasionally see a car drive by, it was barely noticeable. The fire stove worked well, though I did bring extra firewood and used some of it (was in the 20’s). Great experience!!"
632,10,Great stay!
633,10,Yay!
634,10,"Our puppy loved it! Please make sure you know how to start a fire, it gets really cold! Five stars %100."
635,10,"We absolutely loved how easy everything went! From check out to the things that were provided to make our stay easy, it was perfect!! We will definitely be back!! Maybe consider opening up in Texas👀 These Texans loved unplugging the whole time!!"
636,10,fun unique stay at the glamping dome. situated on a beautiful piece of property by a creek. extremely comfy bed and close to town. i recommend bringing your own lantern (ours died and wouldn't recharge) as well as an abundance of firewood if you're staying in winter. i was lucky to have an extra bundle in the car or we would have froze as temps were down in the 20s and we used all the provided wood before midnight. i would recommend this place for spring or fall
637,10,The scenery was beautiful. The dome needs a little bit of TLC.
638,10,"BEST stay ever. This was completely last minute and not planned at all but the yurt was a great place to stay. We have 3 small children and they slept comfortably in the 2 bunk beds ( we brought a air mattress expecting everyone to sleep separately ) We roasted marshmallows on the back porch over looking the river, the kids loved the window, Sean cleaned off the stairs of the slippery fallen leaves to reveal a beautiful natural rock stair way and there’s wagons in the parking lot to take all your stuff to the yurt extremely helpful. Unfortunately the would left inside was alittle wet but totally made up by the fact that there were lighters and lamps and kindling available at the ready. No cell signal it was awesome. This was the first time camping with a wood stove inside and absolutely kept the yurt warm all night it was wonderful. Thank you so much for all the effort you put into keeping the area beautiful and comfortable. Thank you for having us!"
639,10,"Stay was fantastic! Very beautiful area with a creek right under your camp site! FYI this is basically a very nice tent, otherwise you are camping! NO kitchen, toilet, running water, or lights.
A few things to note:
-you are able to see your neighbors
-the lights provided are limited in battery (definitely bring your own!)
-there are portapotties within a short walk of the dome and a portable toilet inside the dome
-you need to bring all your gear in wagons (provided) from the parking site to the dome which less than a quarter mile.
- the drive from the main road to the campsite is very long and windy. expect the last mile to take >20min and you will loose service right when you turn off the main road!"
640,10,Enjoyed our stay!
641,10,Great place
642,10,We had an amazing stay! It is a very relaxing environment.
643,10,Absolutely loved it. will be back!!!!!
644,10,"Enjoyed our experience overall. The bed faces the road and the traffic can see directly into your dome, so very little privacy, although the dome does have a wall for changing and wiping down with wipes. Come prepared, one light worked for about 20 minutes the other simply never worked. The provided battery pack was on about 50% which was enough to charge the fans provided. The walk with the carts is not level at certain parts and can be difficult maneuvering the loaded cart provided. The dome gets uncomfortably warm during the day time, but that’s a great time to sit by or in the creek.

The bed was very comfortable, we slept great with the cool nights. The port o potty was very clean."
645,10,This place is awesome!!!
646,10,"My wife and I booked this dome pretty last minute as a spontaneous one night getaway and were very excited to give it a shot. We have since received a full refund on our purchase.

Positives:
The location is really really nice. It’s situated down a twisting and turning road off of a creek with plenty of moss and rocks and natural beauty to take in. We spent a good few hours fishing and goofing off all through the water.
Communication on getting there and getting in is spot on.

Negatives:
The dome is advertised as luxury glamping with plenty of bright, clean, shiny photos and specifically offers things like an indoor swing chair by the window, clap on LED hanging lanterns, a Weber grill, places to hang a hammock inside, etc. All of the above listed items were advertised but not actually there.

The whole interior of the dome was dark and musty due in our mind to the thick winter insulation that lined the inside of the dome….in August. A stark contrast to the bright and airy feel that the pictures portray. Additionally the dome lining both inside and out was just plain dirty. I get that this is the outdoors and all, but buildup of dirt and debris could be seen all over, even on the windows (which is a big selling point). Even though this is the outdoors, it was evident to us that basic maintenance has been ignored here.

There was one battery bank, not two. Could be that they replaced two smaller ones with a single large unit but still worth mentioning.

No battery in the smoke alarm, compartment was just left open.

Two of the three provided battery fans were dead, in addition to one of the battery lights. On the topic of lights btw, the pictures show some nice attractive moon bedside lamps, but all we had were just some cheap basic rechargeable lights.

One of the wagons (the only one we saw before making it down to the dome with all of our stuff) had a broken wheel.

While we did have a grill, it was not the one seen in the pictures. It’s a concrete post grill, not a weber grill on the porch as advertised.

We reached out to our host about these issues and they responded very quickly. They were sympathetic to our frustration and explained a few things. They are absentee owners who have a hired caretaker. The winter insulation was left up for the summer to see if it would improve conditions, which means it no hanging chair or hammock while it’s installed. They also said the hanging lights were recently stolen.

If we were told this info up front when we booked, I might not feel so irritated by those items. Stolen lights? I get it, not their fault. But the combination of all those things i mentioned just made it clear that little effort has been put into making these worth the money you pay.

After it was all said and done we just felt really frustrated and confused by the listing."
647,10,"We enjoyed our stay at this awesome glamping experience, but just wish we could’ve stayed longer! The bed was comfortable and the tent was super clean. The only downside is you can see/hear the cars on the road above the stream, but it didn’t bother us too much."
648,10,"This is a fun, unique experience. I’d bring some extra light source with you."
649,10,"The location is absolutely perfect! Being on the River was such a treat for our family. The dome contained all the items you’d need for the camp element like grilling utensils, games, lanterns etc. It was nice to have the extra potty in the space as well. The dome can be stuffy during the day depending on weather, but cooled off well enough for sleeping. We were able to run the fan all night. Waking up to the forest view was very nice. Boone is super close so we just ate dinner out and then went back to the dome site. We had zero service with our phone once there, so if you did need something you’d have to head out to get signal first, but luckily we were all good."
650,10,"Fun Glamping, easy to find and wonderful Creek to splash around in!"
651,10,Love this airbnb! Great place for some solitude in nature.
652,10,We had a blast spending time outdoors with the comfort of sleeping in a bed at night!
653,10,One of the best camping experience. It had everything luxury with nature. Creek was the best part.
654,10,Enjoyed our stay
655,10,Lovely Pacific Dome situated next to a peaceful stream with a nice little swimming hole. I would definitely stay here again.
656,10,Beautiful experience!
657,10,"My family of 4 (2 kids, 9 and 5) absolutely LOVED our stay in the Original Dome!!! Seriously, one of our favorite family getaways. No one is joking when they say there is no service/wifi etc....and that's a PLUS for quality family time. Weather was perfect, the dome never got too cold or hot - very comfortable. Beds were perfect. Loved falling asleep and waking up to the sound of the creek. Used the grill to cook hotdogs, chili, eggs, bacon, toast ...and it worked perfectly. Firepit was great for smores and telling our less than scary ghost stories LOL. Our kids never knew how much they loved a creek - spent tons of our time floating in our floats. Definitely bring water shoes for kiddos since rocks can be slippery...the kids loved the nature made obstacle course, of course competing for who had the fewer falls LOL. Would book this a million times over! Next, we will try the Starry Nights dome :)"
658,10,This was such an amazing and unique experience. We’re not very “outdoorsy” people and we felt so comfortable and really enjoyed every second! 10/10 definitely recommend.
659,10,"Me, my husband & 6 year old daughter absolutely loved. It was everything we wanted and more, definitely the perfect place to unplug & reconnect with family."
660,10,"We spent a night to celebrate our anniversary. We really enjoyed the quietness, the peaceful site. The noon and stars are beautiful. Husband took his time fishing and had a great time. This is our third time visits. We will return."
661,10,We had a wonderful time! Highly recommend.
662,10,The place was great. Clean and well stocked for glamping. The beds were surprisingly super comfortable. Can’t beat sleeping to the sound of a creek right outside
663,10,Just as described! Had everything we needed and it was a very peaceful stay!
664,10,We had an amazing experience here. The place is beautiful and so peaceful. We would definitely come back if ever in the area again.
665,10,"If you need to recharge and connect with Mother Nature, this is it! Peaceful"
666,10,"If I could think of one word to sum up this location it would be, magical. It was my second time staying here and my friend‘s first time and it was awesome! We arrived and the weather was perfect. Everything was green, water was clear, birds in the sky, wildflowers, butterflies….I mean it was literally magical. Haha we loved staying up late to enjoy the beautiful stars and some tasty s’mores. It was such a nice getaway that I can’t wait to continue sharing with all of my friends and family. So please, just go! You won’t regret it!!"
667,10,Amazing time with family! Great location
668,10,"Such a fun, unplugged, getaway!"
669,10,"This is an experience you won’t forget! The domes are unique, and give you the opportunity to be immersed in nature and next to the stream, but also feel like you have a luxurious place to sleep at night. Would also be great in Fall to see the colors, or early summer to enjoy the stream and cool off."
670,10,"Very instagram worthy. Cute and romantic and very close to Boone. I would suggest coming here in the spring time to enjoy the creek and not have to use the wood burning stove. We stayed when it was 17 degrees at night and had to use the stove. The wood provided was a bit wet and the tent filled with smoke even with the stove door closed. I’d suggest bringing your own very dry wood to avoid the smoke or go in the spring and avoid the stove all together. I would also suggest bringing your own games (we were provided puzzles), your own wet wipes (there were only 4 in our yurt) and of course your own water. You’re definitely camping but the bed is incredibly comfortable and the porta potty is very clean."
671,10,"My family and I were so excited to be visiting this site as our very first airbnb experience. We read all the instructions and the Q&A provided by the host and packed accordingly. However, when we arrived at the camp site, we quickly began to notice that not all of the promised amenities were available. There were no screens for the dome windows, so during the day I was stiffling hot. There were no paper towels, no board games (which were needed because it rained). The lights were not charged and the charging cords were not in the dome, so we could not see anything aside from our flash light usage. The camp stove needed maintenance and was not usable for warmth. It filled the dome with smoke, a health hazard, especially without the screens for the windows. We huddled together in all our cold weather gear and still froze all night. The next morning we all had soot in our nostrils from the attempts at keeping warm. We left as soon as we woke. I tried to contact the host on the first day, but due to no cell service it was impossible. After we canceled and left after only one night, I tried to work with the host for a refund. These were extenuating circumstances but the host was non cooperative. I had to contact airbnb support. I was waiting to write this review pending the result of the refund request. I don't like to complain and if this had been resolved in a mature and understanding manner, I would have left a glowing review despite all the hardship we faced. Only recommend staying here in warm weather months."
672,10,Awesome place to disconnect from hustle of the life and unwind. Touch of nature with convenience is this Glamping! Do try it for yourself and see. Will definitely come back.
673,10,Had such an enjoyable stay! The sound of the creek throughout the night was an added plus :) an experience I won’t forget
674,10,"Loved an opportunity for a one night stay in a dome! Even though we came pretty prepared, we definitely suggest bringing an extra blanket or two and extra firewood so you stay warm inside and can enjoy the outdoor fire pit too! The sound of the River was incredible! It was a great chance to unplug and reconnect with our family! Very primitive Glamping at its best! Will be back…when it’s warmer!"
675,10,Absolutely beautiful!
676,10,Beautiful views and cozy accommodations.
677,10,"We had SUCH a great time at your stay. So glad we were able to disconnect from the real world and connect as a family. We learned so much being unplugged. It was a bit cold our first night, but we figured it out the next morning and the next night was soo toasty. It was such a learning experience for us and really enjoyed it!!! Will definitely come back during the summer!!"
678,10,"Overall this wouldn't be a bad experience if you went in any other time of the year outside of winter. We; however, had the pleasure of going during an extremely cold time of the year (late Jan single digit temp) where snow, ice, and wind were overwhelming. The dome was so cold and held in all of the moisture that our blankets/bed sheets were absolutely soaked after dripping on us all night. It's nice to unplug, but there needs to be clear communication about the must-haves dependent upon the time of the year you are going. We had to trek through snow/ice/3-4 inches of mud with our wagons to transport our items. The outside bathroom facilities were the most unappealing amenities on the entire site, so much as we chose not to even attempt to use them. Again, this is not a suggested winter experience unless you are a highly skilled/trained camper to be able to truly enjoy your time."
679,10,"100% recommend this place to anyone looking to “check out” for few days. It’s close enough to town that you can get out for dinner or groceries, but far enough away that you feel like your in your own private paradise."
680,10,"Very cool but close to a road and I’d recommend bringing extra wood, what they provide is not nearly enough."
681,10,Great place for the kids to explore without iPads and then come back to the tent for s’mores and snuggles. Caught up my reading and just relaxed! Easy drive to blowing rock and other trails.
682,10,"Thank you very much for everything we love it, we definitely want to reconnect with nature, it is something magical"
683,10,"What an amazing place- even in the winter months! We wish we would have arrived earlier so we could heat up the dome because it took a few hours since it was so cold.

Paper towels and extra blankets would have been a nice addition!

But you cannot beat the starry sky- they looked like diamonds in the sky!"
684,10,We had an amazing experience glamping! I especially loved how dog friendly it was. My German Shepherd had a great time. The host was super attentive and responded to all my questions in a timely manner. I will definitely be coming back and recommending.
685,10,We had an amazing experience camping in the cold. The firewood provided kept us warm throughout the night. Many memories to be had from our one night stay in the mountains!
686,10,We absolutely plan on going back very soon. It was the perfect little getaway!
687,10,🥰
688,10,Definitely going back
689,10,Please come prepared..
690,10,"My husband and I went glamping for our 5 year anniversary and what a great experience it was. We laughed and talked for hours, played games, and enjoyed nature.

Our hosts gave detailed instructions on the listing and FAQ so we followed it to the letter and it made the difference. The original dome was spacious and warm thanks to the chimney and an extra quilt we brought. Overall we loved our trip.

Thank you for a great trip!"
691,10,Great stay! I could see every star in the sky and sleeping by the river was magical!
692,10,Love this location and would stay here again.
693,10,"We had such a great time! Our kids loved exploring the creek and being “free-range” for a couple of days. The king size mattress is super comfy and the bunkbed is great for the kids. Make sure you understand how a wood stove works before arriving. If you don’t know, ask. Lastly, go ahead and book your next stay because it’s incredible!"
694,10,Cute.
695,10,This trip was just what we needed! It was nice having zero phone service so there was plenty of time for conversation and relaxing. There’s something humbling about finding your own fire wood and cooking on a wood burning stove. It got pretty cold a couple of nights during our stay but thankfully there were extra blankets and pillows. The pups loved their vacation too. We will most certainly be back!
696,10,"My girlfriend and I spent a few days here enjoying the scenery and peacefulness of nature. We had a BLAST. This was our first time camping and this was a pretty simple introduction.
The environment was so quiet, close to hiking paths, and not far from food restaurants and such when we decided to do that. Awesome experience"
697,10,"This place is super cute and completely without “real world” communication. No cell signal the entire time I was there…it was amazing. The dome itself, just as advertised-minus the swing chair-pictured in the original dome posting. If you think staying here is like staying at a hotel, nope! It’s just what it says it is, glamping. I bet it’s super fun in the summer since the creek is right outside. I enjoyed my time at the dome."
698,10,We loved our stay here. Great weekend away and easy to get into Boone if needed.
699,10,"This is the best way to camp! The view waking up was just incredible. We were worried that it might get a little chilly (and didn’t want to put the stove on) but whatever the comforter was made of seemed to trap heat well so we were just fine. We made a fire on the porch and said outside late into the night - the fire and the water were so peaceful. We left our logs, so hopefully the next group enjoys them!"
700,10,"My gripes first: paying almost $300 for 1 night is a lot to swallow after realizing there’s no running water, no bath/shower, & just a port-o-potty for using the restroom. Glamping is too high quality, more like “Camping, with no running water & shower+bath”. But because of the price we paid, I thought they’d be readily available. I shouldn’t assume again.

We also didn’t expect 2 other domes to be about 50 yards from us, which were also occupied when we went. The neighbors were quiet. The port-o-potty truck though, it came around 7AM & created A LOT of noise for 30 mins.

Besides those 3 major complaints, it was spectacularly clean! The dome itself did a very good job keeping most bugs out. There were about 2-3 that I spotted throughout our 1 night stay, which is freakishly impressive!

The sounds of the creek was magic to our ears. I wish there were less loud dump trucks that drove by, but we have no control over that.

The instructions for the check-in was detailed enough to follow! We enjoyed our stay & made the most out of it (thank God my girlfriend is not a “princess”!). We wouldn’t book here again though. Maybe for less than $100/night than almost $300/night."
701,10,"Nam, first so happy your stay was magical and we were spectacularly clean! Let's use your review as a teaching tool for future guests that fall in love with photos and choose not to read descriptions nor multiple recommendations to read our FAQ (which is very detailed to hit guest expectations and make sure we are the right experience). Our 3rd paragraph (40 words in) reads: ""No WiFi. No plumbing. No electricity. NO PROBLEM! We thought of everything!"" Reading anything would have 100% prevented your arrival confusion, prevented your coming and prevented a bad review? How can you say we don't accurately describe our experience if you don't read 40 words into our description?

We are a primitive camping experience WITHOUT water and electricity. If you were looking for ""Not Camping Super Plugged-In"" we would recommend one of the 6000 cabins in the area for rent with WiFi, electricity and plumbing :). We are called ""Glamping Unplugged"" which is the opposite of being plugged in...

If you are reading this response, read our description. When you book, you will get a link to a very detailed FAQ, read it and cancel if we aren't for you. Our FAQ is meant to keep certain guests ""in their lane"" and off property. Read every Airbnb description before booking, right? Our camping experience is NOT for everyone. But the ones that choose it, absolutely have the experience they were hoping to experience, an unplugged, nature-immersive, potentially life-altering experience."
702,10,"Very great experience to my husband and I who considered ourselves love to go camping but rather sleep comfortably on king size bed. This place is very beautiful and convenient. We love hanging out by fire pit, having our quiet time together, waking up to the beautiful nature that this place offer. We definitely go back for more nights."
703,10,We LOVED our stay! Everything we needed was there! We love the disconnection from the world for a quick weekend getaway the pups loved the creek!
704,10,"Awesome get away! You are truly unplugged, my wife and I and the pup had an absolute blast!"
705,10,"Good spot, nice and private. Brought our dog who swam endlessly in the creek right outside. Bed was comfortable and place was clean 😊"
706,10,"Glamping Dome is the “original” that we stayed in and definitely nice. 3 domes on whole property yet all private. Place was spectacularly quiet and picturesque. The dome is definitely a unique stay. I would highly recommend arriving in daylight which we did. After unpacking, you can play in the cool waters babbling over stones of the creek on a warm day and what a welcome DELIGHT. No cell service is real.. and perfect for disconnecting and unwinding. Outdoor fireplace with feet up book and a babbling river below… and sun setting… wow..fabulously Fabulous! Many extras provided. Big wagons are provided to allow you to trek over the bridge and up the hill to the dome ..our wagon had a flat tire but we didn’t check it before and there was another one available that we could have snagged if the fact was realized beforehand. If you need to get away from the chaos .. this tempts you to breathe, relax and soothe your soul with a nice immersion in nature."
707,10,A beautiful location and a exciting experience.
708,10,We stayed three nights and our children still weren’t ready to leave! This was the perfect compromise between roughing it in a tent and being completely pampered in cabin. Icing on the cake was the serenity of the area and the sound of the creek.
709,10,"A well rounded experience. I took my service dog on a solo trip. It was a perfect balance of work and play for the both of us.

Thank you!"
710,10,"Perfect getaway! We will be going back annually! This mini vacation was exactly what we needed during this crazy and chaotic time.

Beautiful!"
711,10,"We loved our stay, the kids enjoyed the stream so much and stayed for hours. The forest and the nature sounds is something else.

But here’s a few tips to make your stay a bit better.
1. Pack a a lot of insect repellent remember you are in the woods! Protect yourself from those little buggies
2. Pack a lot of water and ice especially if you are coming summer time.
3.Enjoy everything around you, nature at its finest!
4. Try ti find places to go around as well. They have plenty of tourist attractions!"
712,10,We had a fantastic weekend in the Original dome. It was the perfect way to unplug and reconnect for our anniversary.
713,10,This place was AWESOME! We had the best time playing in the river all day. The beds were SUPER comfy and plenty of airflow at night. Definitely do it!
714,10,We are so happy to have hosted you all! Kids and husbands next time??? :)
715,10,"What an amazing experience! Despite a couple of rain storms our stay and ability to ""unplug"" was exactly what we needed. We're all about making memories and this definitely made an impact. Communication and hospitality were top notch, check in and all other things were a breeze. From the crazy comfortable bed to the slightly chilly, but oh so fun creek ... we can't wait to be back!"
716,10,"Slightly chilly in August, love it! Do come back Erin, next time with your full party, but so happy you had the experience with your little one without interruptions :)"
717,10,We had a great time glamping. The property is beautiful and the host makes everything easy.
718,10,"Words can’t accurately explain what a true “unplugged” experience this little slice of heaven provides. If you are looking for a relaxing reset, look no further! The kids enjoyed the creek (as did the adults) and the firepit creek side was perfect for relaxing and taking in the surroundings. I enjoyed taking it in and photographing the family memories being made! This will definitely be a return spot for us!"
719,11,Couldn’t have asked for a better stay! Communication was super timely and made sure we had all our questions answered! Look forward to making this trip again in the future!
720,11,Me and my boyfriend loved this place! We were able to enjoy tranquility of the mountains and being secluded while being so close to town. My favorite part was the beautiful porch with the view. Evan takes pride in his properties and you can tell how hard he works. I look forward to coming back next year and to see how far hes come!
721,11,Thank you so much Madysen! It was a pleasure hosting you. One year ago we had just bought the property and there was nothing but trees here... I too am excited to see what we have a year from now!
722,11,Beautifulllllll!!! We were so grateful to spend the night here - can’t wait to come back :)
723,11,"Such a unique place! Exactly what my boyfriend and I were looking for. We wanted something private and secluded but not too hard to get to, camping but not ""campground"" with kids and people everywhere, we wanted a fire pit and grill, a place to hang if it rained (so happy it didnt!!) and this place was PERFECT! so cute and cozy with lots of local hikes and falls. The place was very clean and had clear instructions for anything we needed! We walked around the road we drove in on (super casual, easy) and it had some of the best views. Loved every second!"
724,11,"Madelyn, thank you so much for your detailed review! 🙏 You said it better than we could, and really appreciate your attention to detail here. Look forward to seeing you two again!"
725,11,"I loves my experience here, absolutely beautiful and Evan is super friendly and all around a great person! 10/10 recommend this stay"
726,11,"Coolest airbnb I've ever stayed in, umm.. can I just live there!? We were fortunate enough to run into Evan as we arrived early. He takes pride in what he's created and truly wants his guests to have an amazing glamping experience. Love the idea of a gratitute journal! Grateful to come across this yurt and the ultimate nature immersion at the gnomes yome!"
727,11,The Yurt was great! Evan was very helpful and responsive.
728,11,Awesome experience!
729,11,"Incredible place that's off the beaten path enough to feel private and remote, but not too far that it was difficult to get to off the road.
Upscale camping, with basically everything you need with additional amazing little touches to make it feel like a retreat without abandoning what makes outdoor trips memorable.
My wife and I loved the place, and the host is super nice and accommodating.

My only disappointment is that we didn't stay longer! Would definitely come back again to this cozy and adventurous little neck of the woods."
730,11,"Our time spent at The Gnomes Yome was wonderful! The view, and the attention to detail in the yurt was greatly appreciated. Will be back!"
731,11,Amazing experience. Probably the best getaway experience I’ve ever had. Has everything you need out in the middle of the woods. Thanks for letting me stay!
732,11,"This place was wonderful! It rained the entire weekend we were there and it was still fabulous. Very cozy for a camping experience. What we could see of the views were stunning, and the area is just beautiful! The hosts are very friendly and easy to communicate with, and the whole stay was very relaxing. Def reccomend!"
733,11,"Gorgeous views, and perfect time of the year to visit! We returned home feeling grounded and refreshed !"
734,11,"Evan was an excellent host! He was quick with a response when we had a question and super kind. Excellent location and beautiful Yurt, will definitely be back!"
735,11,"I thoroughly enjoyed myself. If you want to feel secluded with an amazing view this is the place.
And the host was awesome. He added some personal touches and was extremely accessible if I had any questions"
736,11,"We loved staying in the gnome yome! The yurt was clean, cozy, and had everything we needed for a restful weekend. The view from the deck was beautiful and the property is so peaceful. Evan was a great host and was in communication with us all weekend. It’s clear that they have put so much thought and love into the gnome yome and take great pride in it- as they should! It was perfect and they thought of everything. We will be back to stay again!"
737,11,We stayed in the yome for two nights and had everything we needed and more. Evan has thought of every detail needed for a comfortable stay in nature.
738,11,Loved this place! It was extremely clean and cozy with an amazing view. The host was very kind and helpful. Highly recommend!
739,11,Hidden gem off the Blue Ridge Parkway. 5 stars—highly recommend!
740,12,Great place to stay!
741,12,"This was a beautifully-situated property, facing the perfect view of the mountains in front of us. Frankie was a swiftly responsive host, willing to be helpful w/ anything needed. We had to message him about initially not being able to get our 2WD vehicle into the designated parking spot (made it up & through the mountains just fine—it was only the gravel lot that kept the car tires spinning and digging in the dirt, unable to move). We asked if we could park in his personal driveway, that is on the same property, as the pathway would’ve been easier to maneuver. He agreed, & it should be noted that we were eventually able to park in the designated A-frame spot, but it wasn’t the easiest to do, so note if 2WD.

For privacy reasons, know that there are 2 homes in very close proximity to the A-frame. The hot tub is situated on an elevated platform, giving a focused view of the mtns—gorgeous! There was a mini fridge in A-frame, to our pleasant surprise. Overall, great spot! Would recommend!"
742,12,"The parking spot has been addressed and fixed. We had allot of rain lately and booked up so I was unable to pour concrete to fix it. The parking at the top is not personnel its shared with the yurt guests, tiny home guests, and me."
743,12,Came here during a wind storm! Frankie and his partner checked on me and bolted down the plexi glass side of the A-frame to minimize the noise. They even offered to let me stay in their guest room/use their kitchen bc the wind was so bad. I was stubborn and stayed in the A frame. It held together well! The hot tub felt amazing and the view was great as well.
744,12,The perfect opportunity to do glamping! A frame is very cozy and Frankie it’s very friendly!
745,12,Perfect mini getaway 💛⛰️
746,12,"Had a great time, beautiful views and cozy A- Frame. We really enjoyed our trip."
747,12,Great stay and amazing view!
748,12,"Frankie was very attentive and helpful. We had some trouble with trying to start the heaters, but he came down right away to help without any hesitation! Such a nice stay and the hot tub made it even better."
749,12,"LOVED THE VIEWS!
The place is definitely not made for rain but it comes with glamping."
750,12,"I'm sorry you were not happy about the rain we had a significant rain storm with flash floods it was not a normal day. Regarding value 3/5 stars I provide a hot tub, grill, and propane which is the majority of costs of running the glamp site. With firewood and other amenities on request many other guests have been fine with the exceptional value I provide. How can I improve that for you for future guests it was not indicated in the review. For those booking in the future message me about any concerns and I'll be happy to respond promptly. I see any stars below 5 as a bad report card but if nothing is added I can't help or change and improve it. Again I'm sorry you did not have a 5 star experience and unfortunately I can't control the rain being out of control."
751,12,"Overall our stay was enjoyable, mostly due to the views and the hot tub. It rained overnight while we were there and the plastic panel on the side of the A-frame was extremely loud. Luckily we brought ear plugs or we wouldn’t have been able to sleep. Also if you want to sleep in I’d suggest bringing an eye mask, you’ll get very bright morning sun in the cabin. If you’re looking for something rustic this place is great!"
752,12,"We had a great time!
Frankie was so helpful and even came outside to help us start the grill and find stars in the middle of the night!
Very responsive, great suggestions, we will definitely be back!

The location is beautiful and has a great view of the smokies."
753,12,Great place to stay!
754,12,The stay was great! Frankie was responsive and helpful.
755,12,Beautiful view and fun atmosphere for Pearce and quite
756,12,Amazing views and amazing area! Beautiful a-frame overlooking the mountain and was also nice and private.
757,12,"So worth the money, a much needed break from life"
758,12,Place is just as advertised with great views. Comes with everything you need for a fire and had some marshmallows waiting for us in a basket. Even has a telescope for the starry nights. Great place!
759,12,"We loved it - It’s very tidy but it’s cozy, comfortable and romantic. The sunset was incredible, one of the most beautiful I've ever seen. Frankie is very friendly, communicative, and kind. He gave super tips about the place, city to visit and things to do. Don’t forget to go to the casino! The hot tub and firepit made the climate more romantic and warm (it was very cold). Anyway I only have good things to say, a peaceful, beautiful and good place for couples. We really recommend this place."
760,12,"Lovely peaceful place to get away! During my stay it was rainy and cloudy so being in this cabin felt as if I were in the sky in the clouds, very peaceful. The weather also worked out to use the hot tub in and was a wonderful amenity to experience. Even though it did get very chilly at times, the space heater was an amazing addition for wanting warmth and worked very well. Overall my experience was splendid!"
761,12,"Beautiful scenery, peaceful. Glamping - outdoor bathroom and definitely need multiple heaters in the cabin when it's very cold. The pipes froze so a shower wasn't an option, but it was still beautiful and relaxing. The hot tub was very nice as well as the bon fire, which they provided all of the supplies for. The bed in the cabin was also very comfortable and there was an electric warmer under the sheets which was very nice. The view of the mountains from the porch can't be beat!"
762,12,"Frankie is such a sweet person! He really made us feel welcome and happy with our stay. The views were spectacular, indoor room was extremely cozy and warm, and the hot tub was the best part! Really enjoyed the snow as well. ❤️"
763,12,Everything was as advertised and the view plus the hot tub really made for an enjoyable experience. Great place to stay.
764,12,"Loved our stay! The view of the mountains did not disappoint. Hot tub was amazing and easy to use. The camping toilet was very clean (unlike other portable toilets we’ve used at glamping airbnbs), which we really appreciated. The little cabin was very warm at night (heated mattress and 3 heaters). Definitely be prepared to be a bit chilly if you come in the winter, but it was overall a great experience for us."
765,12,Amazing stay! Frankie and his fiancé were so kind to help out with anything pretty fast. And his fiancé makes the best kimchi pancakes 😍
766,12,"We absolutely loved the location, the view was great. The cabin was just like the pictures. We got snowed in the day we arrived and Frankie was very helpful. He cleared the path and added de-icer, kept us updated on the weather from local news, asked us if we needed anything and gave us a s’mores care package. It got down to 17 degrees felt like 7 and we stayed warm the whole time."
767,12,what a view! amazing
768,12,A very peaceful place to visit!
769,12,Amazing stay and view!
770,12,had a great stay
771,12,Frankie is an awesome host!! So quick to help with any issues yet let's you have your privacy. He was even generous enough to open up his own house for a shower when the outdoor shower was having a problem and then fixed it that day. Pictures do not do the view justice especially from sitting in the hot tub. Super cute for a weekend in the mountains. Close to cherokee casino and Maggie valley. Definitely recommend this unique spot.
772,12,Awesome place. A little cold but we knew that heading there. Frankie went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable. We will be visiting again one day! Unbelievable view!!!
773,12,"We had an amazing time at Frankie's A frame! My boyfriend, myself, and the doga are avid campers but also love the cabin feel. this was the best of both worlds for us. we came from Florida and stopped here midway on our way to Indiana. the a frame is cozy and insulated well. the view is unbeatable the pictures don't do it justice. the shower is an outdoor shower which I love it just takes being shown once to know how to operate it. my only suggestions for Frankie would be to maybe add a shower curtain to the shower room to block the wind in the colder months and maybe add some sort of hook in the room so you're able to hang a towel/ your purse/ a coat, ect. otherwise bring some coffee and some wine you guys are going to love it here!"
774,12,"Awesome place! It was freezing outside so the hot tub and space heater inside was amazing!!
Definitely worth it!"
775,12,"Frankie was an amazing host made sure everything was great for us, very caring for his guests. The view was absolutely incredible, would definitely book again!"
776,12,"It was extremely beautiful and the space was super cute. I will say though we were very cold. With both heaters on high, the room would only get to 62° according to the temperature meter on the heater. I think the issue there was a spot I could see outside from the inside so I think the heat was just escaping. Otherwise the place was great! Hot-tub is a very nice touch and the grill was handy."
777,12,I have sealed the unit up and current guests were able to confirm that the indoor temp rose to 92 degrees testing the new heater on max. I have also insulated the propane tank for better pressure so it does not shut off anymore when the tank is under 25% full. I understand heating and cooling is the number one in a listing. That said I cant predict the weather and I had no idea that the temp was going to drop this low and hence why I have not got the best of reviews lately than normal. I have fixed the issues but I cant fix anything that is not addressed and unfortunely Morgan you did not say anything during your stay it was not until the review that the heating was mentioned good for future guests not good for you and a under 5 star experience. As a super host I would have more than willing at any time at night been willing to bring back up heaters to you and I have extra blankets to make the stay better. At any rate I do not ignore reviews they are wake up calls to fix and make the experience better for anyone but my biggest thing is to please contact me as soon as there is a issue so I can resolve it and if not discuss options. Thank you and I hope you book your stay with me for future guests reading.
778,12,Very cool place to stay and host is very helpful.
779,12,"Very nice stay! The views were absolutely stunning and we were warm all night with the heater in the A-frame. The directions were very easy to follow and there was even a parking spot just for the A-frame. Only a couple things I would change:
1. A guide for the shower and toilet
2. More fire wood made available (or just recommend that we bring our own)
3. The upper part of the bed was soaking wet, not sure where it came from but we were able to put blankets over it and sleep okay.
Overall a great stay!"
780,12,I will be making a guide for the shower and toilet as its a glamping experience its not your normal setup. I make firewood available you just needed to message me and I would have been happy to bring some more down. I leave one bundle as for most guest that stay one night a bundle is all thats needed. As far as the dampness that got in I have since fixed that it was not a problem in the past we had a severe rainstorm and some water went through the vents at the top. Thank you for addressing these concerns and will be fixed for future guests and if guest have questions please message me im on site.
781,12,"My boyfriend & I Stayed at Frankie’s place for a quick birthday get away. It was absolutely everything we hoped for and more. The views are breathtaking , especially seeing it when you first wake up. We had an incredible stay & hopefully will be able to book again soon. Frankie is awesome and made sure we had everything for a comfortable stay. Highly recommend this beautiful place!"
782,12,"Frankie was a great host. great with communication and had clear instructions. it was extremely dark and foggy when we arrived and he had lights where we needed to go. we didn't see the trail to get to the place even with the lights so Frankie came down and walked us to our spot. our stay was a great ""glamping"" experience. unfortunately with the weather that meant going outside in the cold and rain to use the restroom. The a frame where we stayed has a plexiglass front which in warmer weather would be awesome because he has it where it can lift up, we did not use this feature because we wanted to keep all the heat in we could. I'm glad we took extra blankets. he has a propane heater and space heater but we didn't use the propane over night. use it. after a minute the smell goes away and heats nicely. this was a great memorable experience and we're already talking about coming back in the summer. yes their are hangups but it's glamping not a hotel"
783,12,This was an amazing stay! The last time we had such an awesome view We walked from my house with the backpacks! Sit by the fire and watch the sunset and the next morning enjoy the hot tub is watch the sunrise. Frankie was a great host and answered our questions quickly and thoroughly. I would definitely recommend this little A-frame to anyone who wants a unique and peaceful experience.
784,12,"Wife and I stayed for a night over the weekend and it was exactly as pictured. We had a nice time with a fire on the deck enjoyed the sunrise! Brought our French press and enjoyed our coffee with the view! The heating was sufficient as we already knew it was not insulated, he’s done a great job providing everything you need. Although if you have a heated blanket and plan to stay during winter months bring it! The inflatable hot tub was a nice touch! Great guy as well, would definitely stay again!"
785,12,A very peaceful location!
786,12,This was a great experience and Frank goes out of his way to make sure his guest enjoy there stay. Will definitely book again!
787,12,"This was my second time staying here and it is one of my favorite quick getaway spots in the Smoky Mountain region. The location can't be beat; right outside of town, but far enough out to be secluded and have an incredible mountain view. When we arrived this poor man was hustling to set up a second heater for us after leaving his grandfather's funeral just to make sure we would be warm foe the 19 degree weather we were going to have that evening. Frankie has been nothing less than attentive and reliable both times I've stayed. This definitely won't be my last time visiting!"
788,12,"So first off, Frankie is awesome and is doing his best to make the place nice and homey. But I want any other renters to manage their expectations, it is very small and similar to camping in a wooden tent. There is no insulation so it was very hard to keep warm, and he had propane heaters with open flames that has to be a fire hazard. There isn’t electricity run to the facilities, just an extension cord. The bathroom is a porta potty. The water lines were frozen so we had no water. Overall it was a fine place to stay, but we wish we would’ve known what we were getting into before going, so I thought I would warn everyone. Frankie is super friendly and accommodating though. I wish him the best of luck in making this a great place to stay as he works on it."
789,12,Let me start off by saying my grandpa passed away and on the day of the funeral Lily gave this review.The Mr. Buddy heaters for glamp enthusiast would know are safe and not a fire hazard. The temperature is extremely cold and parred with a passing family member I did not have the resources to fix and was booked. I did not cancel everyone this week. The temperature is my responsibility and I am improving with better heaters as well as letting everyone know showers will be unavailable during winter because it was 20 degrees outside for the shower. As far as a wooden tent that is seriously inaccurate that sounds more like a doghouse. I think Lily was not the ideal candidate for this glamping adventure but I will incorporate that going forward. I write this while following the hertz to the graveyard. My guests come first and I will do anything in my ability and control to make you all happy. You are my boss I take responsibility and I got a bad report card. Always improving and for you.
790,12,"The place is fantastic!
We were worried that we’ll get cold, since it is late November. However, there were 2 heaters and blankets inside. The view is absolutely gorgeous. All the supplies are there for the grill and the hot tub is easy to use.
I suggest taking ear plugs just in case. A really bad storm started during our stay - and it got very loud inside the a-frame quickly.

Frankie is super helpful and replies right away. We will definitely be back again in summer!"
791,12,"What a magical little glamping spot! Great location, and very easy to find/access. The views are spectacular. The inflatable hot tub was clean and hot, we had a warm shower and the little A-Frame had a heater, which was appreciated on a cold 22 degree night! I loved cooking breakfast and dinner on a gas grill overlooking the mountains. Close to the Blue Ridge Parkway, and hiking. Really enjoyed our relaxing stay!"
792,12,"Frankie was an exceptional host, who stayed in communication and made sure to help us with whatever we needed. Very attentive and kind. Not only was Frankie exceptional, so was the A-frame cabin. The view was unlike any other. There was also a nice hot tub which was nice to decompress and warm up after a long, chilly day. It was definitely a 10/10 experience and a unique experience I think everyone should try."
793,12,Absolutely incredible. So glad I booked Frankies spot for my last minute birthday getaway. Its exactly what I needed. That VIEW!! Even better than I could have imagined. I would love to come back.
794,12,I would recommend Frankie's a million times . If you have a loud busy life and just need a get away to some peace and quiet or you love a breathtaking view this is the place to go . Frankie is an awesome dude very accommodating and kind . If you are thinking of staying for 2 days add another you won't regret it .
795,12,"Place was cute, clean and affordable. On a downside the hot tub only got to 90 degree and wouldn’t heat higher. Would stay again it was a quite place and in a good location."
796,12,"Perfect location for amazing hiking, close to Asheville, and the view at this Airbnb was incredible! The hot tub was great after a long day of hiking. Frankie was very quick to answer any questions we had!"
797,12,"This place is absolutely gorgeous, and it's perched deep in the woods on top of the smokies. It's definitely a rustic ""camping"" vibe, so don't expect to enjoy it if you hate camping. Thats definitely part of the charm. If you go with the mindset that you're ""fancy camping"" in the mountains, you will be in heaven.

We had no trouble staying warm at night, or cooling off during the hotter parts of the day. The outdoor shower is hot, and completely private. Overall, we were super comfortable and had a great experience. I wish there could have been a little electric kettle, or french press/percolator so we didn't have to leave the site at all."
798,12,"My wife and I really enjoyed our stay at Frankie's place. The view is spectacular and was well accommodated. We were comfortable at night, there are space heaters and A/C in the cabin if needed. We would definitely stay here again if we're in the area!"
799,12,"Awesome property with an amazing view. The Aframe was charming and cozy, filled with games, and books, it was wonderful. The side opened up to the most stunning view. There was a fire pit, a hot tub, a grill, hot water in the outdoor shower, and the host was very attentive with personal touches. He even left a s'mores care package. Thank you!"
800,12,"Nice place to stay as long as it's not cold. it's a very small ""cabin"" with no insulation. That being said, it's a great view and nice location."
801,12,"There is no insulation because it would be to hot. I did not receive any text about you being cold, I have electric and propane heaters. In the photos you can see it has no insulation. This is not a house and a glamping experience maybe with more communication with me we could have had a 5 star experience."
802,12,"The view and stay was incredible!! Frankie met me as soon as I arrived and showed me to my incredible tree house for the night !
He even got the hot tub started for me to watch the sun set over the mountains !"
803,12,"Frankie’s place was a perfect getaway for fall foliage viewing. To our surprise, there was a blow up hot tub and a fire pit that were lovely touches. Will definitely be back!"
804,12,Awesome place to stay with great view
805,12,"The place is absolutely gorgeous. Such a small, quaint, and quiet. It was the perfect hideaway for my husband and I. It was clean very clean and the communication was spot on even when we had to message him at 1030 at night. Would definitely stay again!!"
806,12,"Tree house is at a beautiful location with amazing views. If you want to have an off grid experience this is the best place to be at. Highly recommend this tree house space for somebody who wants to stay close to the nature.
Frankie was a great host and helped us to get everything we needed."
807,12,all in all it was a okay experience.. the view is spectacular and the fact that you can open up the side of the A-frame is pretty cool. but other than that it's pretty barren. It got to be pretty cold up on the mountain and there is no source of heat nor availability to a fire. also the view is gorgeous and requires a cup of coffee and unless you drive down off the mountain that's not possible. finding the place was very very tricky as we drove up and down the mountain multiple times because The address given is not correct. You also have to park your car out of sight inches off of the side of the road and leave it. Didn't really like that part. it's a cool spot but it would be a cool spot if it were roughly 50 to $75 a night.
808,12,"Frankie was an awesome host! We booked last minute and he made sure everything went smoothly for our stay. He was so easy to communicate with and responded promptly to all messages.
The A-frame cabin was open and airy with the side lifted, and perfectly cozy when we closed it. The views are absolutely stunning! I highly recommend adding this charming and rustic experience to your bucket list! We can’t wait to stay again! 😊"
809,12,The A frame cabin was a not true description the cabin implies that you would be in a structure that is enclosed. It was not. The view was amazing but the water wasn’t on so I wasn’t able to shower. The door for the cabin was not made so that bugs and mice stayed outside. The bugs came in first but stayed to themselves. It was very dark and the place to park was washed out a bit so I didn’t feel comfortable leaving. I woke up to a mouse climbing up my leg at 4am and mouse poop all over the bed. The grill did not work with out a lot of extra work. I asked for a refund and he would not refund me fully. It has been a week and still no refund. This was my worst air bnb. The guys renting it out was in another country. He had his brother help but he also didn’t know how to fix things.
810,12,"Nicole chose to stay after I communicated and fixed your concerns, The mice and bug problem was a result of you leaving food in the A frame, this is the smokey mountains and a camping experience. I would have been happy to give you a 100% refund but you chose to spend the night and so all I charged was the cleaning. I am a super host I do what is fair and right I communicated with you and Airbnb and we resolved this issue. I dont believe I deserved a 1 star you did not ""feel comfortable leaving"" that's on you I did everything and communicated effectively and in a professional matter."
811,13,This beautiful dream cabin was by far our favorite place we have stayed! It was so serene and peaceful! I cannot say enough good things about our stay. The cabin was clean and spacious and the hot tub was an added bonus. Even on a rainy day it was still beyond perfect for our family. Grateful for the fully stocked kitchen with dishes and pots and pans! We were able to celebrate Easter dinner a day early as we would be commuting on Easter all day! Loved it! Thank you so much!
812,13,We loved this place the view was amazing 🤩
813,13,The view was incredible! The hot tub was lovely after a day of hiking. It was a cozy place for my family of four. Nadine was very responsive and kind. We will definitely be back! Thanks for the hospitality!
814,13,My husband and I really enjoyed our stay here. We especially loved the hot tub. The view was spectacular. Nadine was an excellent host.
815,13,This place was amazing! The views were spectacular and so peaceful. We loved drinking coffee while sitting on the rocking chairs on the deck and drinking wine while relaxing in the hot tub. The cabin was incredibly cozy and so tastefully decorated We loved our stay!!!
816,13,"What an amazing place with stunning views, we only stopped for one night but could easily do more, even the drive up to the lodge on the dragon route was fantastic. Would thoroughly recommend this place to anyone looking for their own private get away and relaxation, if we are ever back in this area would definitely see if the cabin is available."
817,13,Absolutely perfect house in a perfect location. Wonderful for a weekend giveaway!
818,13,Nadine was great! The place was clean early and she let us check-in early. Super quick responses and offered to mail back my one item that I always leave! Would definitely stay again. View from the hot tub was AMAZING!
819,13,"The place is wonderful! Great views, awesome hot tub, everything is neat and clean. Definitely will come back again!"
820,13,We highly recommend staying at this beautiful place. It’s truly remarkable and something you won’t forget anytime soon. The views are breathtaking and there are lots of great hiking spots close by.
821,13,"Absolutely loved staying here. She left many recommendations and tips for staying at the cabins. The drive up was a steep incline but since the road up and the driveway is paved, it wasn’t too bad!"
822,13,"This place was perfect! Felt like we were at home, super clean, organized, and had instructions for every answer we had! Private and in a beautiful area, will definitely be back!!!"
823,13,Had a great stay with amazing views
824,13,"the view is worth the money.
we stayedin the hot tub longer than I have have in my entire life, watched the sunset and stars come out. then woke up early to the sunrise. gorgeous view! comfy beds.

we want to come back a little longer next time."
825,13,"We had such a delightful time at the cabin! Beautiful view, cozy, comfortable home, great location, and the hot tub was amazing. We are very much looking forward to returning!"
826,13,This place was amazing! Fully recommend if you are looking for a peaceful vacation. Lots of great hiking spots around.
827,13,"We loved this mountain dream cabin. It was well-provided with supplies and amenities, and it was definitely one of the cleanest airbnb's we have stayed in! We came and visited for our anniversary -- the views were amazing and the hot tub was perfect. Everything was very clean, the surroundings were peaceful. We would love to visit again in the future!"
828,13,Definitely the best cabin we’ve ever stayed in! This place has everything you’ll need for a peaceful weekend away. Will definitely be back!
829,13,This location exceeded our expectations. Nadine is a fantastic hostess. We are already planning to visit in the future. I highly recommend it.
830,13,Great place!!
831,13,The place was beautiful with a gorgeous view! Super comfy cabin. Only issue was the distance from Gatlinburg was nearly 2 hour drive away.
832,13,"It was awesome and I will be back again it was better than I expected!
I loved it!!!"
833,13,"Our trip was amazing! The house was very clean and comfortable. Also, you can’t beat that view from the hot tub! Nadine left very thorough instructions and was responsive throughout our stay. When she found out we were on our honeymoon, she left a bottle of wine and two glasses on the counter for us. We are definitely planning on visiting again."
834,13,We loved our stay at Nadine’s place. Everything was just as described and Nadine was super responsive for the duration of our stay. We loved the views and the hot tub! Will definitely try and stay here again.
835,13,"Awesome private location with a beautiful view. The home was perfect for a quick overnight getaway and the hot tub with the Mountain View makes this place worth coming back to! Nadine was a great host, very responsive! Definitely recommend."
836,13,Nadine’s place was even better than the pictures! The space was very clean and cozy. She was easy to communicate with. The hot tub view was AMAZING!!! Would definitely stay again.
837,13,Had the best stay. It was very peaceful and quiet. House was spotless and cozy. We stayed with myself my wife and three kids and it was perfect. If you want to detach and get away from the world this is your place. I will be booking again. The hot tub is wonderful and there is minimal ambient light so you can see all the stars.
838,13,6 Star View! Enjoyed watching the fog roll through the mountains!
839,13,Amazing and really understanding host ! She went out of her way to make the trip perfect how ever due to travels we were not able to stay here but host was amazing and responsive!!
840,13,"We came to stay one night at Nadine’s to go to the Polar Express in Bryson City. Nadine’s place wasn’t anything particularly modern or fancy, but it was clean, super cozy and you absolutely cannot beat that view. Nadine had thoughtful touches throughout that made us feel like we were right at home. We loved the hot tub after the polar express and enjoyed it one last time in the morning before check out. There aren’t a lot of options in the way of restaurants without having to head into Bryson City- but it’s an easy 25 minute drive. And while I would normally look at that as a downside, the remoteness added to the serenity of the place. We regret not booking more nights and will definitely stay here again and plan to pack groceries so we don’t have to leave much and can just relax and enjoy. Thank you Nadine for such an excellent stay!"
841,13,Perfect for our family of 4 to enjoy relaxation while still being close enough to enjoy so many area adventures.
842,13,"We had an amazing time at Mountain Dream. Nadine was a great host. She was very responsive and even let us check in early. They views were amazing and the hot tub was perfect. The house was so cozy and it was great to relax by the fireplace. We loved the place so much that we only left it once to ride into Bryson City. The drive up the mountain may be a bit testy if there is ice on the ground, but we made it up there with no issues. I highly recommend this place and Nadine as well."
843,13,great view
844,13,"Absolutely picture perfect in every way imaginable. The view left me speechless in its beauty. And the cabin is so cozy and full of light! You truly feel cocooned in your own little slice of heaven on earth.

Nadine was also extremely helpful and responsive! And very thoughtful too, as she bought us a bottle of wine since this was a trip to celebrate our 15th anniversary.

The cabin was spotless and the hot tub was DIVINE. I can't say enough good things about this place, it's our new favorite and we're already planning our next trip here. Thank you for hosting this beautiful place, Nadine!"
845,13,Thank you for your kind words and for choosing my place to celebrate your anniversary! I’m looking forward to having you back again!
846,13,Nadine was amazing! She answered every question we had extremely quickly and was very friendly. The cabin was a perfect cozy getaway for us and our pups! The views even in November were absolutely breathtaking. The hot tub was very relaxing and had great views from multiple seats. The fireplace also made the cabin nice and cozy when the temps dipped. It was nice to lounge and just enjoy the mountains. Life is MUCH better in the mountains!
847,13,Cozy cabin with beautiful views. Would definitely come back
848,13,"This was a great getaway cabin to disconnect and enjoy some time away, we loved the hot tub sunrises and sunsets over the mountains."
849,13,"The whole stay was seamless, would highly recommend this stay to anyone looking for a nice getaway!"
850,13,Very comfortable and the view is amazing from the almost every part of the house. The hot tub is the best part. Definitely planning to go back again.
851,13,Absolutely beautiful views from the deck and hot tub. Cabin was very comfortable. Quite a drive up the hill to get there but worth it for the views and seclusion.
852,13,"What a view! Definitely worth every penny!

Nadine was VERY quick to answer every communication and extremely helpful and flexible.

The driveway up was scary the first time when we didn’t know what to expect (we come from a much flatter part of the country), but was fine going back down. Honestly, we were so happy at the cabin that we never left until we had to, and even then it was literally the very last minute!!

The temp controls all were very accurate and easily adjusted for each room individually. The fireplace lit with the press of a button every time. The hot tub was perfect and just as majestic as it gets featured in everyone’s photos. The water got hot quickly, too!

We put together the puzzle that was on top of the fridge, a 300 piece job, and made the joke that we’d only give a 1-star review if it was missing any pieces, but it wasn’t! Phew!

We walked down and up the driveway every day, about 1.5 miles according to the Fitbit, and loved it. Even got to chat with a very nice neighbor about halfway down. The neighbors near the cabin were either not there or completely silent. It was PEACEFUL!

Only good things to say. Thank you, Nadine!"
853,13,"Absolutely love this place. The view with the hot tub for my family was the best part. The gas fireplace is great, considering the instant flame. The road going up to the driveway, if you are not used to inclines is a little bit intimidating, and you may feel like your car won’t make it, but our little four cylinder did. After maybe the third time in and out I got pretty confident in that drive. The actual driveway is even steeper, but also doable. I definitely would not recommend any large pickups or inexperienced motorcyclists. Speaking of bikes, the Tail of the Dragon is a little over a half hour away, and Bryson City the same. I would also recommend the diner there for sure. Nadine was very quick with responses to questions and the brochures and info book in the house were very helpful."
854,13,Great little personable cabin! Beautiful view and a wonderful hot tub!
855,13,The view is AMAZING! We had a wonderful stay and Nadine is so helpful and informative. I would recommend this stay 100%!
856,13,The reviews do not lie & the home was as described. The host was very responsive & gaining access was made easy. The view of the valley from the deck makes it all worth it. I hope I'm lucky enough to revisit this one! We had a blast & thoroughly enjoyed our mountain getaway.
857,13,Beautiful place. We had such a fun time just hanging at the cabin and enjoying the views.
858,13,My husband and I had a great stay here. Well kept place with an amazing view.
859,13,"Was a nice getaway, relaxing on the back porch in the rocking chairs looking out at the awesome view. Driveway getting there was an adventure at first but after a few trips up and down it’s actually kinda fun. Nadine was very quick to respond to any questions we had definitely a great host, Would for sure recommend if your looking for a great Mountain View."
860,13,This mountain dream cabin was a great destination for us. It has amazing views in the morning and in the evening. Sitting in the hot tub enjoying an adult beverage after a long day of hiking was just what the doctor ordered. The fully stocked kitchen was fantastic for preparing meals as well as having a full compliment of spices was also a great thing. The bed was comfortable and afforded a good nights sleep. Overall this location was fantastic and would highly recommend.
861,13,"The place was fantastic. It had the most beautiful view one could ask for. it was a perfect little get away from society. The only complaint i have (which was out of the hosts control) was the road up to the house, very narrow and steep. BUT it was 100% worth it simply for the view. I would greatly consider staying again if i am in the area."
862,13,Absolutely beautiful home with a incredible Mountain View.
863,13,Very beautiful location. Wonderful stay. Superb host
864,13,Everything is exactly as described. The view is gorgeous and the beds are comfortable. The home has everything you need for a comfortable stay. The hot tub is great!
865,13,View was awesome and the host was great. Being able to have our dogs made it so much better.
866,13,"Perfect quiet and relaxing spot. Amazing views from the hot tub. Nadine was great, excellent communication."
867,13,"its a great place.
make sure you have a good car and wish to drive to mountains"
868,13,Best mountain stay ever. Our host Nadine was amazing and helpful. The drive and mountain views are spectacular. The hot tub is the best part!
869,13,Awesome! Beautiful view! Clean! Nadine was a great host! Would definitely visit again in the future!
870,13,"Such a beautiful cabin! Secluded with a great view of the mountains. Very clean, with fresh linens and towels set out. We loved our stay!"
871,13,The view is spectacular!! The hot tub was a welcome treat after spending the days hiking the mountains.
872,13,"Nadine is a wonderful host and very friendly! When my boyfriend and I came for the week it was raining a lot and the wifi shut off, because a line went down. She was very helpful with suggestions and even offered to bring a hotspot over so that we could stay comfortable! The airbnb was very clean and she made everything easily accessible and easy to find. It was also very nice and surprising to receive a bottle of wine on our arrival, which was enjoyed in the hot tub! It was also only about an hour from The Great Smokey Mountains but there are a bunch of other trails closer to hike! Overall, best host I have ever had and I wish I could rate this stay EXCELLENT! 10000/10 recommend for friends, couples, and family."
873,13,Great place!
874,13,"Unmatched view in the area. Nadine was was on point! We got to the location later than expected and Nadine made a point to turn the porch light on for us. Great location, would definitely book again!"
875,13,"This cabin is EVERYTHING. The views are amazing. It’s very quiet and secluded while still being close to everything you may need. The cabin looked and smelled very clean. The road to the cabin is narrow, but we had no problems getting in and out. The hot tub was very clean and comfortable. The host provided all essentials to make it feel like home and also provided a bottle of wine.
Allowing our fur baby was also a plus! We’re already looking forward to coming back."
876,13,"Beautiful place to stay. Nadine has everything thing you need for a relaxing stay. Everything was clean, organized and comfortable.The hot tub was AMAZING!"
877,13,Nadine’s cabin is spectacular. It’s the perfect cabin to soak up the beautiful Mountain View’s and is well equipped with everything you need for your vacay in the mountains.
878,13,If Mountain View’s and a cozy environment is what u are wishing for look no further this gem of a escape is nestled in the perfect spot to have a cup of coffee and watch the sun rise or enjoy the stars while relaxing in the hot tub Nadine is the perfect host and makes sure every accommodation is top notch … definitely deserves a revisit and 5 stars ….
879,13,Very nice little cabin with a beautiful view! The whole place was very clean and comfortable and the hot tub is such an awesome bonus!
880,13,"This place is a must stay! Beautiful views and a sweet cabin with everything you need. The hot tub actually gets hot (I know this seems obvious but I have stayed at airbnbs where the hot tub wasn’t great - this one rocks!) and again, INCREDIBLE views! There are some inclines getting in which was no issue in the summer, but if you are booking in winter be mindful of the car you’re driving in. The host was super kind and a great communicator."
881,13,Great view!
882,13,"By far my best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in, very clean, location is phenomenal, and the host stays in contact if needed, I highly recommend this place!😄"
883,13,Amazing place & view very clean would definitely recommend!
884,13,Comfortable cabin with stunning views.
885,13,This was an unbelievable getaway! Incredible views and the accommodations are immaculate! The town is so cute - a hidden gem! We plan to be back!!
886,13,"Nadine's cabin is a magnificent secluded getaway, perfect for those looking for a lowkey weekend away. the hot tub is definitely the highlight - the view is to die for, and if you enjoy the hot tub during sunset / evening you'll also have the pleasure of enjoying LOTS of fireflies! it's truly magical. The cabin has all the basic necessities you'd need, and the mattresses are SO soft and comfy. It's a bit of a steep & narrow drive up the road to get to the house but absolutely worth it. Nadine was extremely communicative during and after booking; she's a fantastic host and I will definitely be staying again!"
887,13,"Spectacular view from deck and hot tub!! Inside clean, quaint."
888,13,Awesome view. Great cabin
889,13,"Absolute perfect stay! We were only there a few days, but I could easily see staying for a week or 2! Nice and private, with the most incredible view imaginable! Even though the drive up is windy and steep (duh it’s the mountains) it’s right off Route 28 which is very convenient. Nadine had great suggestions of things to see and do in the area, and was very helpful and responsive to messages! Would love to stay again!"
890,13,"The place is pretty much what you see in the listing, we loved it. Nadine is a great host, super communicative and accommodating. Great spot!"
891,13,This place is an absolute dream! Everything about our stay was great. The view is awesome and can be seen from the deck or from the couch inside. Everything you needed was there with every detail thought of. Nadine is such a great host and goes the extra mile to make this place outstanding! Thank you Nadine! We hope to visit again soon!
892,13,"Amazing mountain view. Clean, easy and relaxing!"
893,13,Had an awesome time. Amazing views.
894,13,"Thanks for letting me and my friends stay for the night, the cabin was amazing!!! It was the perfect way to end our camping trip after a few days of tent camping up in the smoky mountains
The view was breath taking from the hot tub. I’ll definitely book again if I am in the area again"
895,13,"Nadine was great! The cabin was clean, the views absolutely stunning. Wifi wasn’t the best but outside of that our stay was pretty good!"
896,13,The best place !!!!
897,13,"Such a wonderful gem in an amazing location! The hot tub, fireplace and view are unbeatable. Amazing hospitality, communication and cleanliness. Would stay again in a heartbeat! Thank you!"
898,13,This place was gorgeous! It was the perfect place to go for a relaxing weekend. The house was super nice but the views were even better!!!
899,13,"Exciting road up to the cabin once you leave the main road. 🙂 I was pleased to find a much greater stash of spices than just salt and pepper, so if you like to cook… Nadine was easy to work with and accommodating. The cabin was clean, the view was great, the stars were nice, the hot tub pleasant, the setting quiet. And whatever time I was outside, I wasn’t bothered by mosquitos (it was spring). I would recommend. Thank you, Nadine."
900,13,Wonderful view! My wife and I had a great time!
901,13,This is a beautiful place. Private but close to all the hikes on our list. Nadine was very kind to let us know it was ready before our check in time. The view was exactly as described and the hot tub was perfect.
902,13,The cabin was just perfect! Everything was just as described. We loved the view and jacuzzi! Nadine was easy to communicate with and everything was clean. Would definitely stay again!
903,13,cabin was as described..mattresses need to be replaced worn out..sheets smells of mildew other than that nice place
904,13,"Wonderful view and peaceful place to stay, hot tub was very nice and soothing while looking at the mountains. If you have the chance to stay here, book it! It’s worth it!"
905,13,Great cabin. It was as advertised. Definitely worth it.
906,13,"Great location and beautiful views from the deck! The cabin was clean and had everything we needed. We also had fun playing with the puzzles and games that are available for guests. The hot tub was awesome also.

Nadine was great, there was a bottle of wine waiting to welcome us when we got there and she made sure we had a great stay. We didn’t really have to contact Nadine with questions much since everything is explained well in the welcome binder but when we did, we received help quickly. Nadine was attentive to our needs while also leaving us to enjoy our vacation.

The road going up to the cabin was intimidating at first but i just took my time and it was easy, and after the first drive up and down it was actually enjoyable.

Thanks Nadine for helping make our vacation a good one we will remember for a long time :)"
907,13,Thank you for all the great Advice regarding WiFi! I really appreciate it and will try to figure it all out! Thank you for being great guests! I’d love to have you back anytime!
908,13,"Best air bnb I’ve ever stayed in. It’s secluded and private. So quiet and relaxing! This cabin had all the essentials, and the views do not disappoint!"
909,13,"Great place, we plan to come back!"
910,13,Beautiful space with unbeatable view. Excellent host!
911,13,"We had a great time. The cabin was exactly as described, clean and comfortable."
912,13,The cabin was just as described. The view is absolutely incredible and definitely the highlight of our stay. We wanted somewhere quiet to relax and it’s definitely what we received.
913,13,"Amazing view, just like the photos. Very clean, had everything we needed. Hot tub was great as well haha. I would definitely recommend this place!"
914,13,This place is just absolutely breathtaking! We loved our stay here and will definitely be back in the near future!
915,13,"Nadine's place is comfortable, quiet, and has a spectacular view that can be enjoyed from the hot tub, living room, and kitchen! Everything was just as described and Nadine was an exceptional host. That said, I think we'll definitely be visiting again 👍"
916,13,"We were delighted to stay in Nadine's place! The views from the hot tub were beautiful, and the decor inside was amazing! Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a peaceful break"
917,13,can't wait to return! best Airbnb we've stayed in.
918,14,We really enjoyed our stay! The perfect place to getaway and unwind!
919,14,Perfect ! Cozy walking up aning the trees! Comfy bed :)
920,14,Loved this place! We spent one night with our two toddlers. The space was tight and cozy which is exactly what we were looking for. It rained the whole time but it was honestly very peaceful to listen to the rain fall on the roof.
921,14,"So …we gave our China Grove experience 5 stars primarily because our host Trent was proactive, super responsive and extremely. Looking forward to returning with our grandkids."
922,14,Such a wonderful experience. We are already talking about going back with our kids!
923,14,This was our second trip and both treehouses were great. Can’t wait to try the rest!
924,14,What a fun place to stay! We loved waking up and seeing the trees surround us. I can’t wait to go back and check out a different treehouse!
925,14,My husband and I had a wonderful time! We enjoyed our mini vacation at the treehouse and will be back again next year!
926,14,We had a great time and will likely come back again
927,14,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Miss Molly treehouse. We definitely plan to visit Cherry Treesort again in the future!
928,14,"Met a friend for a quick night getaway and Miss Molly was such a cute place to stay! Like a mini cabin in the trees! Everything was clean, coffee was stocked with Keurig, mini fridge had s’mores packets! I would definitely stay here again."
929,14,We stayed at the treehouse for just one night but will definitely be coming back. We kept the trip secret from our 6 year daughter and the look in her eyes as we drove up and told her that’s where we we’re staying was priceless. Great times at the fire pit and the bounce pad. The treehouse itself had a great deck and was spacious enough for 2 adults and 2 kids.
930,14,"Great little get away, quick response from owner on questions, easy to locate, simple instructions!"
931,14,Super cool idea for a unique place to stay. Treehouses are well spaced for privacy and a quiet place to be. Houses are unique and just as described. Would definitely recommend to someone staying in that area.
932,14,We really enjoyed our night in the treehouse.
933,14,"We had a wonderful time staying at Miss Molly! Excellent use of the space and a peaceful, calm environment. Our 6 year old loved the bounce pad and making campfire s’mores. We’d definitely visit again!"
934,14,"This place was so nice, everything was clean and nice! I've stayed at many wood cabins, and this treehouse has been the most beautiful and clean place I've stayed!! I love how much effort they put into their space! The jumping pillow was a bonus for my kids, we stayed and jumped on it after checkout with no problem. I will be telling my friends and family and I will be back soon. Thanks so much, Cherry Treesort!!"
935,14,5/5. Will come back and stay again.
936,14,It was magical! Can’t wait to book again. The only suggestion I would have is to add a curtain to the bathroom windows. Felt a little on display. Lol
937,14,"The treehouse experience was great! Kids would love the air jump pad and the freedom to run and play outside. The only kitchen appliances are a microwave and coffee maker. If you plan to cook, bring an electric skillet! We stayed in Miss Molly's treehouse. The cabin could use a few minor repairs to spruce it up a bit, other than that the cabin was as advertised."
938,14,Hope to stay next time
939,14,They stay was perfect the tree house was amazing we had a great time looking forward to coming back
940,14,Awesome place and will definitely come back again in the future.
941,14,This was our first time staying in the treehouse. It was very easy to locate and get in. Trent was very responsive and friendly.
942,14,Nice weekend getaway! Planning to visit again soon ❤️
943,14,Great weekend getaway for the kids!
944,14,I had a wonderful 14th anniversary. The place was perfect. The host Trent was super helpful. I left my wife’s anniversary present and Trent held it for me and raced it back to me. The stay was out of this world. Thank you Trent and staff.
945,14,Beautiful location with a cozy feel.
946,14,Great place! Would definitely stay again!
947,14,"A nice getaway for my husband and I, very cozy and clean. We’ll definitely consider coming back someday"
948,14,"Idyllic place, really glad we got to spend New Year’s Eve here. Treehouse was really well thought out and all the space was really optimized. Now we’re curious to stay in all the other treehouses on Trent’s property!"
949,14,The experience was fantastic and well needed!!!
950,14,A second stay at the treesort! We want tj return in the warm weather. Thankful for such a unique experience.
951,14,It was really nice to get away from the hustle of life and just relax in nature with the family. We played board games and snuggled by the fire. Easy check in and was nice to have a later check out time so we could sleep in. Kids loved the pillow jumper and smores!
952,14,Great Christmas getaway for family time!
953,14,"Ever since we seen the treehouses , we have wanted to stay . The Treesort was definetly worth the wait . We stayed in Miss Molly , which was cutely decorated in a cozy cabin feel . Our favorite part was waking up loooking out the windows of the loft realizing we were in the trees . We look forawrd to staying again in the near future ."
954,14,We loved it!
955,14,Had a great time! Came for a much needed weekend away and to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. Thoroughly enjoyed or first time tree-house experience. Will definitely be back!
956,14,"Loved our stay at the Miss Molly! We came for the Polar Express/Lazy 5 Ranch and enjoyed the Miss Molly just as much! Adorable treehouse that was comfortable and had all the amenities we needed. The fly pillow is an added bonus, and we loved the s’mores. 100% recommend, we are excited to come back!"
957,14,Third time staying at one of the treehouses and great time as always!! Beautiful homes and great setup. Absolutely worth visiting!
958,14,What a perfect way to spend Thanksgiving! The treehouse is surprisingly roomy and the loft bed is comfy. The treehouses had Christmas lights and Christmas trees. Lots of sweet touches like the provided Keurig pods! My kids loved the jump pillow. I hope you continue to include that amenity with the rental.
959,14,"What a wonderful and unique stay! The bucket on the rope was a great touch, felt like the kind of place you dream about as kids. Before we left we were already talking about coming back, maybe to one of the hobbit holes this time. Highly recommend!"
960,14,a great experience and very unique! spending a few days in a treehouse is so much fun! we brought board games and sat by the fire! its a great time and we will be back for sure!
961,14,The absolute highest recommendation! A perfect getaway! Very quaint and comfy! The host is phenomenal with wonderful communication!
962,14,"Really impressed with the Miss Molly treehouse! It was easy to find, very clean and nice and cozy. Perfect for a couples getaway, even if it’s just for a night to recharge. We would absolutely stay here again!"
963,14,"Miss Molly is a cute cozy treehouse. It was clean and had the basic essentials for food such as forks, spoons, plates, which I completely forgot to pack lol. Had such a great experience! Definitely recommend for a couples getaway!"
964,14,Such a great week day get away.
965,14,"Great property! Stayed in Miss Molly. Comfortable loft bed. Kitchen area had all needed including coffee maker and pods, microwave, refrigerator, paper ware and plastic ware. S'mores kits and firewood or sale...cute touch from kids of owner. Heater and AC! Nice walking trail on property. Would stay here again!"
966,14,"Very welcoming. Great tree cabin. Friendly and helpful. More information about the cabin needed (e.g. no stove, coffee provided). We’d go back again."
967,14,"It's a cute little house. We were a little closer to other folks than I'd initially imagined, but it didn't affect the experience. The climb up to the lofted bed could be challenging for bigger folks or those with movement disabilities, but I think it's accurately represented in the photos. All in all, a comfortable experience for a one-night stay."
968,14,Everything exceeded our expectations! We will definitely be going back!
969,14,Had a great time. Our first treehouse experience. Loved the firewood and the s’more that are available. The chairs swings under the house are great. Very clean and relaxing. Beautiful place and close to town. The shop owners are very helpful and laidback. Loved the whole experience.
970,14,Loved it. So clean and cozy. Everything I needed in a perfect space.
971,14,A sweet experience for the night while passing through the Carolinas. I highly recommend.
972,14,cutest and coolest place I've ever been
973,14,We enjoyed our stay. Staying in a treehouse was an unique experience. The place was great. It was a little pricey for a place to stay. I guess we paid more for the experience of staying in something different.
974,14,Our family had a fantastic time and loved every part of our trip. We would recommend to anyone looking for a couple days away.
975,14,Trent was a super awesome host. Clearly communicated and answered all my questions in timely manner. We will be recommending this to all our friends and family.
976,14,My son and I really enjoyed the tree house living. The Treesort was clean and organized. Trent provided all information we needed for our stay
977,14,Miss Molly was beautiful and a great experience. We really enjoyed our time and Trent was a great host who responded to questions in a very timely manner.
978,14,"Really cool treehouse campground. The treehouses are up a set of stairs and the beds are loft beds. No internet, but we had great cell service."
979,14,"A quiet escape in the woods. Perfect for time away from the kiddos. (Even though we KNOW they’d absolutely love the whole experience!) Be sure to bring fire starter for your campfire, and lots of marshmallows. :)"
980,14,We had such a great time! Awesome communication & a unique little get away 😊 Our fam would love to come back!
981,14,Couldn’t have been any better
982,14,We stayed in the “Miss Molly” treehouse and had a lovely time! Trent is a great host and we fell in love with the house. It was so charming and we really enjoyed the quiet getaway. We’ll be back for sure! 10/10
983,14,Awesome treehouse but too close to a main road and can hear cars too much.
984,14,"Amazing stay! Beautiful house, cute location"
985,14,"Lovely spot with many different options of lodging. Very close to different restaurants, so it is easy to run out and grab something."
986,14,Absolute gem - don't miss this experience!
987,14,We had an awesome time at “miss Molly” will definitely be returning!
988,14,"Great place, highly recommended."
989,14,Very fun place to stay!
990,14,"Miss Molly is such a wonderfully unique place to stay! While we only spent one night, we thoroughly enjoyed the serenity and charm of being among the trees. Unfortunately, we didn’t have a chance to enjoy the fire pit due to heavy rain, but it’s an awesome amenity. We will definitely be back!"
991,14,My kids loved spending a night in a tree house!
992,14,"We had an amazing stay at the Miss Molly treehouse! My boyfriend fell in love with the adorable, quaint, and unique place to stay. The outside fire was adorable and we spent our night sitting around the fire eating s'mores and swinging while enjoying the outdoors and the wonderful weather. We absolutely loved our stay here and only wish that we had stayed longer!"
993,14,All of the great reviews are for a reason. Everything was clean and the environment was peaceful. Would definitely recommend booking 2 nights.
994,14,Quiet get away that was just what we needed.
995,14,"Stopped here on our travels north back home and are so glad we did. we have officially checked off staying in a treehouse off our bucket list. such a cool place, if I'm ever back in the area I wanna stay in one of the hobbit houses next!"
996,14,Very unique stay! We all really enjoyed this experience and I’m sure we will be back!
997,14,Had an awesome time
998,14,"Awesome lil place to stay. Kids thought it was neatest lil thing to get to stay in a treehouse. Loved they had plates, cups, coffee, s’mores, and other lil necessities available. Close to town for supper or delivery. Water was hot & air was cold! Treehouses close together but not enough to be distracted by each other. Looking forward to coming back & staying in a hobbit house. Kids are holding me to it! Highly recommend even if you’re local!"
999,14,"Great experience, highly recommend! Beautiful area with great outdoor seating."
1000,14,Miss Molly was a lot of fun. Inside was very clean and surprisingly we barely saw any insects inside the home!! The shower gave really hot water which was nice. I hope to one day stay in the other treehouses they have to offer!
1001,14,Really cool place
1002,14,"Glamping Get-Away! Good Golly…The “tree”-mendously charming and cozy treehouse named Miss Molly was perfect location to unplug, reconnect, and relax for a couple of days! Trent was easy to contact and a great host. Highly Recommended!"
1003,14,There are plenty of listings that say they are ‘treehouses’ when they are actually just cabins up on stilts. These are the real deal: supported by trees and among the trees.
1004,14,It was a great experience.
1005,14,Loved staying in the treehouse super nice!
1006,14,"Cute, cozy and in a tree! Everything was perfect!!"
1007,14,"One of the most unique, creative places to stay in. Surrounded by nature and the sounds of birds and crickets, open fields and gathering spaces, this is must visit location if one seeks relaxation and rejuvenation"
1008,14,Very relaxing!
1009,14,Awesome little treehouse
1010,14,"The Miss Molly was wonderful experience!!
Such a quiet little place that is great to unwind!!
Young 10 year old Nick has firewood available for your firepit and 8 year old Molly has S'mores waiting for you in the fridge!! Payments for the firewood and S'mores are on an Honor system so treat them well!! We left them $10 each.
We are local so we're looking forward to checking out other tree houses and Hobbit Huts. We will be back!!"
1011,14,Fabulous place for a quick get a way! Easy to unwind and reconnect with loved ones and there’s always memories to be made!!! We look forward to staying again soon!
1012,14,"Trent was super helpful and very friendly!
Great host!"
1013,14,Second stay and will be back. Great communication and the treehouses are a fun experience. Trent goes above and beyond as a SuperHost.
1014,14,"amazing. loved the fridge, AC unit, available glassware and the bed was comfy."
1015,14,"Lovely adventure with my daughter for a “girls trip.” We had fun visiting local parks and museums by day, then sleeping in the trees at night. Fun space and exactly what it promised. Very comfy bed, given it was directly on the floor. Grateful for the AC during 100 degree days. Recommended."
1016,14,We loved spending the weekend at Miss Molly.
1017,14,"*NOTE: THIS REVIEW IS FOR TRACI'S TREASURE AS I SWITCHED TO THAT TREEHOUSE LAST MINUTE* My friend, who is a China Grove native, told me about the Cherry Treesort a couple years back. Based off of what he said and what I saw online, I knew I wanted to stay there someday. Well, I am beyond glad to say I finally have. The Cherry Treesort is beautiful, charming, and wonderful. Originally, I had booked Miss Molly but decided to switch to Traci's Treasure last minute. Traci's Treasure is gorgeous, spacious, and one of the more ""secluded"" treehouses. As soon as my friend and I drove up to the treehouse and especially when we got inside, I was in awe. First off, the property is beautiful. From the other treehouses, to the trails, to the, well, trees, it didn't feel like we were right off a main road. In terms of the treehouse, it couldn't have been more comfortable (the AC definitely helped). The wrap around deck and smell of wood when entering the treehouse were two highlights. The couch, bed, hammock, etc. were all cozy. Even though it was hot, even at night, we did utilize the fire pit and the s'mores were a nice touch (be sure to bring cash for those and the firewood *we did bring our own*. Overall, I highly recommend the Cherry Treesort. We had a great time and cannot wait to try another treehouse or even one of their hobbit houses!"
1018,14,"Miss Molly was a perfect treehouse, with actual trees growing thru the porch! Fire pit with chairs, grill, trails to explore---just a great get away! We'll go again!"
1019,14,Nice place to get away to for some peace and quiet. Would recommend it to anyone wanting that kind of atmosphere. For a treehouse it was very impressive. Air conditioning and water heater worked great.
1020,14,It's a GREAT place.
1021,14,"Very nice stay at Miss Molly. My wife and I enjoyed the stay. We had never stayed in a treehouse so we only stayed 2 nights. The bed in the loft was comfy, the treehouse was clean and everything was as described. We enjoyed the fire pit area (a big Thank you to Nicks woodshed! ) The firewood was great! Very cozy and comfortable treehouse and a nice place to relax, the only down fall would be we wished we would had stayed longer!!!"
1022,14,Cherry Treesorts will warm your hearts and bring back childhood memories of being in a Treehouse. Everyone should know the peacefulness of sleeping amongst the treetops
1023,14,Good communication and great environment!
1024,14,Thoroughly enjoyed our stay in “Miss Molly”. Had to tell all our friends that we stayed in a tree house when we visited NC. Looking forward to our next trip up (hopefully with friends) to enjoy more time there. A+
1025,14,Absolutely breathtaking & unique place!! And such caring hosts. I definitely recommend this wonderful experience.
1026,14,This place was perfect for a little weekend getaway! Everything was great. I struggled a little with the door lock but I can put that down to human error! The loft bed was super cozy and comfortable. Sounded great inside when it rained as well. Everything was clean and I have no complaints! (Maybe just be careful not to bonk your head going up the ladder like I did.)
1027,14,The treehouse was AMAZING. So relaxing and I will certainly be back. Thank you Trent. Grwat experience
1028,14,"My fiancé and I had the best time. Super easy to find, easy steps, beautiful views of the pretty green trees. We will definitely be back for a longer stay. We had the most amazing time"
1029,14,"Trent was very responsive and helpful in any conversation leading up to the trip. The place was amazing, and upon arrival and checking it out, even better than expected. It was very peaceful and thus far my favorite Airbnb stay. Not only because of the place itself, but it was a successful proposal trip for me, so it now holds special meaning to us and we plan to have it as a regular stay. Loved it."
1030,15,"Great stay, lovely decor, very clean with everything you needed for a stay."
1031,15,"The Burrow was a great getaway spot for my wife and I on spring break! We loved spending time on the front porch sitting in the rocking chairs, looking at the mountains, and watching the animals in the field. The cabin was clean and had everything we needed. Erin was easy to communicate with and provided a great stay! We thoroughly enjoyed our trip!"
1032,15,"An absolute Gem!!! Definitely bigger than it looks and was perfect for two people. The goats, pigs and sheep were so fun to interact with and Teddy was awesome at his job.
Very quiet and peaceful area.
I would HIGHLY recommend staying here."
1033,15,"Beautiful, clean, and secluded! Just what we wanted for a getaway. We used the grill, hot tub, and slept in. Sparkly clean and Erin was so kind and responsive! Can’t wait to come back!"
1034,15,Amazing host they put so much thought and care into the space to ensure you have everything you need paired with proactive communication A+! Such a beautiful and peaceful place to reset and recharge !We can’t wait to book again
1035,15,"Erin’s place was exactly as depicted. Serene and simply beautiful surroundings. The lambs (especially the new born) added to the charm and overall appreciation of being within the confines of nature.

Amazing place to sit back and enjoy the stars on a clear night, grill out if desired or a short 10 minute drive to all the restaurant’s in town.

The space offers all that is needed and is nestled right in a good spot, without having to worry about too many surrounding neighbors/things.

Erin was very responsive and helpful with any questions that arose, while even messaging to let me know that I had left something behind.

Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a relaxing time in the mountains, with plenty of options for nearby hiking, exploring or just searching for a place free from noise.

Even gifted us with a jar of local honey from their own bees.

Quality stay with a quality host!"
1036,15,Erin was a great host! The Burrow was very clean and had everything we needed. We enjoyed the view while grilling. Looking forward to coming back for another visit. Thanks!
1037,16,Amazing place. Would highly recommend
1038,16,The cabin had everything we needed!
1039,16,The cabin was a great stay and just what we were looking for. The bed was phenomenal and we enjoyed the hot tub. Mark was very responsive and detailed. Would definitely stay again and also recommend to others.
1040,16,We will 100% stay here again! Everything was perfect :)
1041,16,"host was amazing and the cabin is even better! best view i’ve ever had on a stay, i accidentally left my coffee maker so if you use an offbrand Keurig, you’re welcome"
1042,16,"Stay was great, view was unbelievable. Only wish our stay could have been longer!"
1043,16,"Amazing panoramic views from anywhere outside & inside the house, and beautiful sunset view from the hot tub! The property is very well maintained, and the house was very clean and stocked with everything you will need. We enjoyed relaxing at the house, but also enjoyed great food and breweries in Morganton. Silver fork winery nearby was also very nice. Host communication was great. We enjoyed our stay very much and will definitely book again in the future"
1044,16,Million dollar view is right! What a beautiful little cabin tucked back in the mountains! Mark was great to work with and his place is stunning! We’ll definitely be back!
1045,16,"Over-the-top, gorgeous, ever-changing views from this cozy place. Host was very helpful with clear communication. Highly recommend this one-of-a-kind cabin in the mountains complete with an occasional deer, turkey, coyote, and eagle."
1046,16,"I can NOT say enough great things about this Cabin! it was so clean, had everything we needed, and was very Romantic. AND THE VIEW oh my goodness!!!
I was a tad bit disappointed I didn't get to see any wild animals, BUT that just means we will have to visit again. thank you for everything. 10/10"
1047,16,I kind of hate to leave a good review in hopes that someone would cancel their reservation so we could stay again. 😀 As most of the other people that stayed here said....once you are there you don't want to leave. Not even to get supplies. The view is amazing. We were there almost a week and only had the TV on for about 15 minutes. The view is your entertainment. We just sat there looking for hours afraid we might miss something. 😀 I took atleast 50 to 60 sunset picture...amazing. And the Stars! So relaxing. We can't wait to do it again. Thank You.
1048,16,The view is truly breathtaking. Very private and peaceful. As owner recommends make sure to go by the store before heading to the cabin. Mark is a amazing host! Very attentive.
1049,16,"Pictures do not do this place justice. It is beautiful, quiet, clean and views are unbelievable.
The host Mark was great everything went smooth
will definitely stay there again"
1050,16,Great place with amazing view. Perfect for the quiet weekend we were looking for. Have shared it with friends and will definitely be back.
1051,16,Amazing cabin with amazing views
1052,16,"This was our first Airbnb stay and we think we picked the best one! The cabin is small but has everything you need. The bed was comfy, the kitchen and bathroom area are compact but have everything you need, and the view from the windows and the deck are absolutely unbeatable! Check in/out was simple and the directions were very clear. The wild turkeys, deer, and other wildlife that kept hanging around really topped it off. This is really the perfect getaway!"
1053,16,"Truly a wonderful getaway! So much wildlife to see: a black bear, deer, all types of birds, skinks. The view was great and we thoroughly enjoyed honeymooning here after a hectic wedding weekend. Kitchen is well stocked with basics, the fire chimineas were easy (Mark does provide firewood), and we even used the charcoal grill (charcoal not provided). I think we used the hot tub twice a day for our entire stay, and the water was fully replaced prior to our arrival. Had the chance to meet Mark before we left - great guy. Hope to be back!"
1054,16,"Words cannot describe the perfection of Mark's cabin in Morganton. It was like being in a fairytale, surrounded by butterflies, bees, and the occasional fawn who joined us during our stay. The views are truly breathtaking and the peoperty is immacculate. The cabin is fully equipped with everything you could possibly need... and then some! Great place for a quiet, romantic getaway.

Although the property is a showstopper, it was Mark's professionalism and communication that really made the experience seamless and stress-free. Unfortunately, there was a plumbing issue on the mountain and water was not working for 3 days, which he assured was highly unusual. Mark kept us updated each day until the water came back on, and kindly offered to refund a portion of the cost to make up for the lack of running water. We appreciated him and all of the love he clearly puts into this property. I hope to return someday!"
1055,16,"We were lucky to come across Mark’s cabin as a rare find that was open the week we were looking, so we jumped on booking and are so glad we did!

Mark was a great host and his cabin had amazing views and everything you could need for a stay. You can tell that Mark has thought of everything you need to make staying there comfortable. We enjoyed sitting on both the screened porch and the deck taking in the mountains and wildlife that this part of the mountain had to offer.

Mark recommended going to the store and getting some food before heading up to the cabin and we were glad we did. The mountain is beautiful, and it is a 15 minute ride to get down the mountain.

If the cabin were available again when we’re looking to travel back to NC, we’ll definitely re-book!"
1056,16,"My husband and I stayed here for a week and it was absolutely amazing! The view and remote location is incredibly gorgeous, peaceful, and inspiring! The adorable cabin has everything you need for a cozy stay. The hot tub was a great place to take in the mountain views and the stars at night. We enjoyed birdwatching and several deer and wild turkey sightings! There is also plenty of fun to be had in town and the nearby state parks and forests. This place is a true gem!! We will definitely be back!"
1057,16,"Everyone is right when they say you won't want to leave once you get to the place (and especially since so much is provided for you there), so plan accordingly!

Also, there were a lot to do nearby -- wine tasting, hiking, waterfalls, kayaking, and more.

Would definitely stay here again!"
1058,16,Our trip to the cabin was just wonderful! We spent most of our time on the deck just starring out to the most amazing view. We loved the peace and quiet and having dinner on the deck with beautiful sunsets. The cabin is very clean and is equipped with what you need. Definitely stop at Ingles grocery store cause when you get to the cabin you will not want to leave again. We can’t wait to return next year. Thanks again for opening your cabin for others to enjoy.
1059,16,I cannot explain enough how amazing this property is- the view alone!!! Cabin had everything we needed but spent the majority of our time outside on the beautiful deck. Loved everything!
1060,16,The cabins perfect has everything you need. We spent most the time at the cabin we did visit a winery called Perry’s berrys and the wine is to die for. My boyfriend had us go back again after he already purchased three bottles of wine so he could get five more. But the other half the time we spent enjoying the sunsets from the hot tub. And eating our meals at the out for table enjoying the view. Bring food bug spray bc there is small black flies that bite like crazy and you don’t feel them and will end up with bites everywhere. The rd to the cabin was nice and easy only two sharp turns. We will be back for sure for our next anniversary to relax at this beautiful cabin.
1061,16,This place is absolutely perfect!
1062,16,"What a gem! The pictures don’t do it justice! The views are just unreal! The deck setup is just perfect and we spent most of the time on it hanging out and watching the Bald Eagles soar. The cabin itself is very cozy, comfortable and accommodating. Very unique experience. Will be back 100%"
1063,16,"Best experience ever! Easy drive, clean, and private. The views are amazing! Mark was an outstanding host. Super relaxing. The bed is cozy. The hot tub is relaxing. We definitely plan to book again."
1064,16,One of the best views around. Mark was a great host and made sure we had everything we needed.
1065,16,Great very clean and cozy! Beautiful view and lots of privacy
1066,16,This place is beautiful! My husband and I went here for our honeymoon and had a great time! The weather was amazing on top of the mountain and the view was breathtaking. The cabin was the perfect size. We loved the hot tub and had a really great experience staying here!
1067,16,This was honestly the best place I’ve ever stayed. The views and the town were absolutely spectacular. The place was so clean and had everything we could need. We will definitely be back to enjoy the sunsets from the hot tub!!!
1068,16,"Incredible get away, nicely setup and great location."
1069,16,"Very nice location, great view, and the deck has a private setting!"
1070,16,A great place to relax and unwind. The cabin was so lovely and comfortable. Mark was very accessible. Definitely want to go back!
1071,16,Highly Recommend
1072,16,"Exceeded our expectations. The view is truly stunning. A couple of days, it was pretty windy up on the mountain so the hot tub was also a great way to be out on the deck without being too cold. Bring a book or download movies ahead, wifi is too slow for streaming."
1073,16,"Incredible view, super cozy spot perfect for getting away from the noise of the city."
1074,16,"As long as you get all your groceries on your way up the mountain, guaranteed you will not want to leave the property til you have to! I can't say enough good things about this place and would go back in a heartbeat. Well equipped kitchen, bath, outdoor cooking setup, very comfortable and cozy furniture."
1075,16,"This was amazing! We visited for our 5 year anniversary and it was just what we needed. The view is amazing, the hot tub made it perfect as we watched the sunset. Make sure you get you need from the store before heading up for the night because you aren’t going to want to come back down lol. They have everything you need to cook your own meals if you wish to. I told all my friends about this place and we will rebook again for sure."
1076,16,"You don’t want to pass this place up!!! It’s hands down the BEST place we’ve stayed, and we go up to the mountains at least twice a year. We will be back for sure!! The views were beyond amazing! We so enjoyed coffee on the porch in the morning and wine overlooking the twinkling lights in the evening. And the sunsets…..were unbelievable!! The cabin was super clean, warm and cozy and stocked with everything we needed. Mark had easy instructions so there were no problems checking in and out. Again, BEST stay yet!! Thank you, Mark, for being such a wonderful host!"
1077,16,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay. The cabin and the views were beautiful, especially at sunrise and sunset, perfect for a romantic getaway. It was a very peaceful and relaxing vibe. The drive up and down the mountain is nice but a little scary, my husband loved it. I definitely recommend grocery shopping before going to the cabin to save yourself any extra trips up and down the mountain. The hot tub is a must, don't forget to turn its lights on. Communication with Mark was great, he was available anytime we had questions. Highly recommend we would stay here again."
1078,16,Majestic views! Cabin was just as described and owner was responsive. It was the perfect location for a couples getaway. The pictures don’t do the view justice!
1079,16,"Beautiful view. Perfect for couple looking to relax. Neat as a pin with gorgeous outdoor deck and hot tub. If it’s open, book it!"
1080,16,"Truly a million dollar view. The place was perfect for our honeymoon. Pro tip : don’t forget anything at the grocery store , you’ll have a hike back to the store! :-)"
1081,16,Beautiful cabin and great hospitality! Will for sure return if we ever find ourselves in the area again!
1082,16,"I surprised my girlfriend for her 30th abs it was perfect. Beautiful cabin with breathtaking views. If you’re looking to get away from the hustle and bustle, this place is perfect. Spent a long weekend with the view and had a hard time leaving."
1083,16,"Excellent get away. The pictures don’t do the view justice. Requires some effort to get there, but absolutely worth it once you arrive. Perfect for those seeking solitude or romance."
1084,16,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay at this beautiful cabin. It was very relaxing, and the view was amazing! Mark and Robin, were excellent host."
1085,16,Beautiful views
1086,16,"Best Airbnb experience we have had! So many thoughtful touches throughout the cabin. The kitchen was fully stocked, we had everything we needed and more. Will definitely stay again!!"
1087,16,"What a perfect getaway! For 2 tired nurses during this never-ending pandemic, sitting on the deck, drinking coffee and looking out at the most breathtaking views simply filled our souls! Pictures do not do it justice!
We did our grocery shopping and meal planning ahead of time since the drive down the mountain is a good 20 minutes or so. We enjoyed hiking a couple of the days - so many beautiful sights to see in South Mountain Park and Table Rock. Other days were spent up at the cabin - sitting on the deck enjoying the view, sitting in the hot tub, playing cornhole, and simply enjoying each other’s company.
You will not be disappointed if you book this cabin. Mark and Robin are wonderful hosts and go the extra mile to make sure your trip is smooth."
1088,16,Great place to stay. Can't wait to come back.
1089,16,"If you book this location, you can expect to have an amazing, relaxing, wonderful time! We soaked in the hot tub, played corn hole, and honestly just sat with coffee staring at the view. We will FOR SURE be back!"
1090,16,"This was a great vacation! We stayed for 3 nights. The ac unit was a tad loud for us so we tired to keep it off for most of the trip. Driving up the mountain was something new as well, a little scary at first but wasn’t horrible. The views is what is amazing. The sunrise and sunset is dreamy. There were plenty of pots, pans, dishes everything that you need. On the last night there was a little black bear that came onto the porch! That was very cool to see. There is plenty of cute deer that you can see. I do recommend going to hike the south mountain trails. Very beautiful as well!"
1091,16,Perfect getaway with stunning views!
1092,16,"Beautiful little cabin…so private, quiet, and peaceful. The view is insane!! Equipped with everything we needed and more. We will be back!"
1093,16,"Hi Susanna,
Thank you for your thoughtfulness by moving the chaise lounges under the porch away from the rain.
We hope you can visit again soon!
Mark & Robin"
1094,16,The view is breathtaking. The cabin was just what me and my husband needed for a break. Loved everything about it
1095,16,"It was the perfect romantic getaway, you won't want to leave the deck!!!"
1096,16,Views are UNREAL!
1097,16,The view was absolutely stunning. Far better than most places I would hike to off the Blue Ridge Parkway. We read out there all day and watched the sun set over the mountains every night. Absolutely stunning
1098,16,"We had a fantastic stay. The view is breathtaking, pictures really don't do it justice. There was a small plumbing issue while we were there, but our host was amazing and made arrangements to get it fixed very quickly. It barely impacted our stay at all. I would definitely recommend this location."
1099,16,"Mark and Robin’s place was AMAZING!!! In fact, amazing doesn’t even fully describe it. Everything is provided for the comforts of home, the description of their property is spot on, and the view... MY GOD THE VIEW! Words nor pictures do it justice!!
Only suggestions I have for newbies to the area is plan your trips to the grocery store/in town wisely. Getting up and down the mountain is about a 15-20 min adventure and totally worth it!!
This is likely one of the most romantic get aways in the blue ridge mountains. If this property is open, make sure you grab your slot quick!! I have a feeling this place will definitely book out quickly.
There is so much to do! We explored the breweries, wineries, food and hiking in the area. This area also provides horse back riding, some antiquing and white water rafting if you’re willing to take a drive. We also spent a good chunk of our time sitting on the porch looking over the valley (highly recommended). You’ll never get bored here!
Again, can’t say enough good things about this place!!!"
1100,16,Absolutely wonderful place so peaceful we did not leave. The bed is super comfortable and all is designed with great taste for mountains.
1101,16,"I really wanted to give this 5 stars. The location is unbeatable, the cabin has almost every comfort you can imagine. The one issue was that the hot tub didn't work on arrival and didn't work until we'd been there for several days. It was a major part of the draw, so that was disappointing. That said, we get that things happen and Mark did try to get it fixed immediately."
1102,16,"Amazing views, clean and nice decorated house! Couldn't have asked for a better place and a better host. Mark answered all questions and was very helpful. We look forward to staying here again."
1103,16,Amazing views! Nicely decorated. Owner was great to work with. Can't wait to return!
1104,16,"To say it we found a hidden gem to stay in is an understatement. This little hideaway in the sky was breathtaking. The view during the day was absolutely beautiful but when nightfall came it was amazing. Just something you would have to see for yourself to understand. The cabin itself was inviting, clean, and very cozy. We found it easy to make ourselves at home there immediately. Waking up in the morning looking out the huge window off the mountain was like being in a tree house. The woodburning stove was also a nice treat for the cold nights. We will definitely be returning to this little hideaway in the sky."
1105,17,Very friendly and a great place to stay. A little paradise tucked away!
1106,17,"This is a unique cabin with lots of history, great decorations and cozy amenities . The gardens are so beautiful ,with fish ponds and water fountains."
1107,17,Thank you Assia. We do hope you return. You can also keep an eye on TramyGardens on FB and watch as the gardens mature.
1108,17,Absolutely perfect get away. It was so quiet and peaceful such a great place to recharge. It’s close enough to walk to restaurants and bars but also private enough not to see or hear anyone around. We will definitely be back.
1109,17,"I have stayed here several times, and consider it a home away from home at this point. Love the property and the hospitality."
1110,17,Billy and Amy are always friendly and helpful! I love staying here!
1111,17,"The cabin is absolutely amazing. The history behind it,the attention to original detail was superb. They have easily combined the old world charm of the cottage with modern amenities. Billy and Amy were very responsive, Billy greeted us at check-in, walked us through the cabin, gave us a detailed history of it, and their son was spot on with an item that we needed. We thoroughly enjoyed renting this cabin."
1112,17,"Quite comfortable. It was a cold, rainy day upon my arrival so the furnished firewood was welcome. I immediately started a fire in the fireplace. (At the host's suggestion, I bought a fire starter log to help start the fire and that did the trick.) I had a roaring fire for several hours."
1113,17,"Such a beautiful find! I would love to return. Kind, responsive, and helpful hosts. This place is a gem."
1114,17,I work night shift as a travel nurse in the area and Billy and Amy are always super accommodating and gracious when I stay. I book here every time I can! I came for the cabin but I come back for the hosts!
1115,17,Absolutely beautiful place. We loved it and we will definitely be goin back.
1116,17,Thank you Brandon. Would love to see you guys back.
1117,17,I’m a repeat guest here because this quaint little cabin is such a perfect little stay.
1118,17,Thank you Hannah for continuing staying. We love to have you here.
1119,17,Serendipitous. This is by far the coolest and most beautiful place I have ever stayed at booking through AirBnB. Everything about the cabin is awesome!!!! And don’t forget the disco light!!!!!
1120,17,I am so glad you like my disco light. I am a fan of color lights. It is amazing that you can see the lights changing their patterns while playing your music.
1121,17,"I booked this charming cabin for a three day reading retreat and it was everything I hoped for. I enjoyed sitting by the fire, strolling through the garden, and soaking up all the peacefulness of this very unique and historic space. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking so some serenity. And I was very grateful to Amy and her husband for being so thoughtful, accommodating and communicative."
1122,17,Thank you Lisa for your kind review. You were such a wonderful guest.
1123,17,"This was exactly what I had hoped for. Rustic charm, very peaceful and the screened porch was a great place to wind down the day, and enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning. Fireplace and couch area was perfect. Will definitely be back."
1124,17,Thank you Mr. Payton. We look forward to your coming back
1125,17,"Amy and Bill’s place was small and quiet. Nestled around a garden and wooden scenery. Absolutely beautiful. Checking in was seamless and Bill, Amy’s husband , greeted me upon arrival to show me the cabin. Very friendly. I would stay again when the opportunity arises."
1126,17,It was peaceful and pleasant. The host was very productive and helpful. We really enjoyed ourselves.
1127,17,Thank you for choosing our cabin. Noted about adding a grill. We will have it available for your next visit.
1128,17,Billy and Amy are always accommodating and gracious hosts. Love staying at their little place!
1129,17,Great rustic get away spot. Picked up pizza in town and spent the night relaxing by the fire watching Yellowstone on the big sceen.
1130,17,Amy and Billy were most gracious. They found out o was traveling for work and working night shift and we’re very accommodating the entire stay. I’ve already booked for my next work trip. :)
1131,17,Cabin was beautiful! Host was very polite and responsive. Def recommend this place to anyone. Very peaceful and relaxing.
1132,17,Really cool. Must visit if you’re into history or carpentry. Very enjoyably secluded. The hosts make access smooth and safe.
1133,17,"I wanted to build a fire. Mission accomplished. I probably burned through their entire pile. But we needed it. We needed time to just...be. We were so relaxed we didn't even venture out to dinner. Just ate snacks in front of the fire. We live on the beach so we weren't really prepared for how cold it would be in the morning--so WOW.

I spoke to Billy about how I could see their property being used as a wedding venue or space for parties and picnics. He said that was the plan!

Good luck and God bless!"
1134,17,Great place and great host. Would recommend
1135,17,Such a great place to stay!
1136,17,The log cabin was just what I asked for for my birthday getaway. We love historic homes and it was certainly that. Cabin was a bit chilly because the weather was colder than expected. The grounds are lovely but Amy and Billy have a lot of work ahead of them. Will be a lovely venue when complete!
1137,17,very cozy little cabin with lots of potential. Hosts were very friendly and welcoming . It exceeded our expectations. we will definitely be back in the future.
1138,17,Amazing cabin and very helpful Hosts!
1139,17,Billy and Amy have a beautiful piece of history here! Very friendly host and accommodating on anything we needed. Highly recommend for a romantic get away!!
1140,17,Wonderful stay in a gorgeous little cabin very cozy feeling especially around a warm fire. Would recommend and stay again!
1141,17,Beautiful cabin and grounds! Walking distance to local shops and short drive to Raven Rock State park.
1142,17,"Very genuine and nice folks, and very informative about the local history. I would love to stay at a time when I didn’t have to leave so early and go to work. I slept well, and felt more at home than I do at my own house."
1143,17,Very beautiful place
1144,17,"It was fabulous! Impressions are amazing! Reality exceeded expectations! The decoration of the house, cozy atmosphere, the place in which it is located, the area around, the lake and everything else! Great welcome, the house is almost 300 years old! We are very glad we visited here! It was nice to touch a piece of US history! Recommended! We will definitely return again! With love, Anastacia and Jacob Forbes!"
1145,17,"I really appreciate that it was available for only 1 night, that is hard to find on Air B and B!
This was PERFECT getaway. cozy, Amy and Husband immediately available if needed. I got here just in time to appreciate the Christmas decorations.
LOVED the firepit and the screened -in back porch. Perfect for reflection and introspection.
I WILL return."
1146,17,"Wanderer's Rest is truly the most charming cabin. The hosts are very responsive, and clearly care about making sure your stay is a great one. The Christmas decorations and lights made the cozy vibe even more inviting. A definite must for a romantic night away."
1147,17,"I would recommend this place over and over again! It’s Beautiful inside and out!! Amy and her husband are very sweet, kind, nice! Definitely coming back again!!"
1148,17,"Friendly, flexible hosts...magical location with lots of interesting features and history!"
1149,17,Amy & Bill were very responsive & nice. Historical cabin was very interesting. Loved the fireplace!
1150,17,"Rented this cabin for my daughter and new son in law for their wedding night beings they were not leaving for their honeymoon until later, they LOVED it. Very charming, rustic, and romantic.
The host were amazing to work with"
1151,17,"A wonderful rustic cabin, set in history and surrounded by a beautiful gardens… Amy and Billy are excellent hosts — with a great passion for sharing the grounds… enjoy!"
1152,17,"What a charming and cozy place to stay! You feel like you are secluded and away from everything, but you're not! The grounds around it are absolutely beautiful and the cabin is 200 years old! Knowing that, treat it gently and you will be more than amazed! You will NOT be disappointed staying here! I've never booked the same Airbnb twice but I'm already scheming to get back here! As a side note, this place is a photographer's dream!!"
1153,17,"Billy and Amy were the absolutely amazing! This cabin is breathtakingly stunning! Pictures do absolutely no justice and this town is precious. We thoroughly enjoyed the live music at Country Seat Bar, which is a literally minute away on the same street. We had a minor personal issue and Billy assisted in resolving. We will be back when it's cooler to use the fireplace!"
1154,17,Wonderful little cabin.
1155,17,"This cabin is absolutely perfect for a getaway! My boyfriend even made the comment of how he can't wait for us to go back when it's cold enough to light a fire!

It is rustic enough to calm your soul, while having all the modern comforts that we are all spoiled to!"
1156,17,"A Great cabin, wish we could have stayed longer. A Diamond in the rough.. Thanks for sharing Amy …Kip and Kathern"
1157,17,Rustic but beautiful...nicely furnished and well decorated. Close to town but quiet and peaceful. Beautiful garden setting
1158,17,Great location and fantastical cabin!
1159,17,"Loved our stay at this rustic historic cabin surrounded by trees and gardens.
Would definitely stay there again when we come in town.
Billy was extremely helpful with a couple of minor issues and made us feel at home."
1160,17,"Wanderer's Rest is an incredible experience. My wife I took our honeymoon here, and I can tell you it's the perfect spot for folks trapped in the urban and suburban world looking for a forest escape without needing to head all the way to the mountains. Note that despite the features all being modern, the plumbing infrastructure is all ancient, and needs to be treated that way. The listing description is perfectly accurate, so make sure you are prepared for a little more rough living than you might be used to with modern amenities.

Cannot recommend this place enough! What a spectacular stay"
1161,17,"My stay was completely comfortable, peaceful and an trip to take soon again. The property owners are very helpful and polite. It is a blessing to be able to be around nature, birds and good people. Thanks."
1162,17,beautiful place to stay especially if you love the outdoors!
1163,17,My family and I came down from DC to spend time with my son and his girlfriend over the long weekend. The cabin perfectly blends “old and new”and provided my soul some much needed peace and comfort from the crazy city life! We absolutely LOVED our time in the cabin and can’t wait to come back in the fall to use the fireplace!
1164,17,"A wonderful place for a relaxing getaway. The cabin has all the comforts of home, but plenty of space from the neighbors. You are within walking distance of tasty locally owned restaurants in downtown Lillington, as well as a lovely park by the river. Just 10 minutes away is beautiful hiking at Raven Rock state park, with a beautiful overlook of the river. Great for a weekend away from home or a longer escape."
1165,17,"very cozy, cool history, nice Tv, friendly host!"
1166,17,Incredible cabin to visit. The history of the cabin is unreal and how many chances do you get to stay in a place that 200+ years old. The host was very accommodating as my wife had a medical issue and we had to leave early. The location is perfect being right downtown so you can walk to some great restaurants. Would recommend this Cabin as a must do. The experience is awesome!!
1167,17,"This is an adorable old cabin yet warm, cozy, and a delightful stay. The open living room dinning area was large and had a great tv and comfy couch. The kitchen is cute small, a microwave and small fridge (not really freezer space) and sink, it was cute and accommodated our 1 night stay. The bedroom was a loft, it is large and super adorable, comfy bed. The bathroom was definitely modern for a cabin. It was private. Only there for a night, would stay again."
1168,17,We loved our stay at the cabin!! The property is beautiful and the cabin is very comfortable. We will be back soon!
1169,17,My husband and I absolutely loved this charming cabin. We will definitely stay again.
1170,17,"gorgeous cabin sitting in Lillington near everything you may need. quiet and full of nature and wildlife. great experience with the hosts, as I did not see them during my stay yet they were certainly attentive and the communication was A+."
1171,17,Would come back again with friends for a girls night. Lillington was a cute area and the cabin a unique experience!!
1172,17,"Charming cabin tucked away but still very accessible to town
Nice quiet getaway for a solo trip or couples
The hosts are great and very responsive! For a cabin of this age, there is surprisingly great water pressure and the water quickly warms up.
The grounds are being restored to their glory days of gardens and water features-very secret garden like.
All in all it was a lovely stay."
1173,17,"We booked with intentions of connecting with one another again and this was the perfect spot! If you’re looking for a place that’s going to transport you to a mountain feel, you’re at the right spot! The hosts were very attentive & quick to respond. If you have time, make sure to get the full information on the grounds/history! It’s worth it."
1174,17,"Perfect location and setting. It's fun to have an early morning coffee with the grazing deer. The cabin is spacious, clean, and updated. Amy is a wonderful host, too!"
1175,17,This cabin is amazing! So beautiful! It really was a treat to be able to stay in such a place. We highly recommend staying here!!
1176,17,"We had a great time staying in the cabin! It’s a perfect quick getaway from RTP if you’re looking for rustic, peaceful, and charming. The hosts are friendly and knowledgeable about the history and have put in lots of thoughtful details to make your stay an enjoyable one."
1177,17,"5 stars all around! Great hosts, great stay. Great experience at this cabin."
1178,17,"Probably the best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at. They were so kind to us!
Loved the little town, great for just a weekend get away!!"
1179,17,We were very happy to host. You’re always welcome back. Semper Fi. Semper Crayolis.
1180,17,Nice and rustic cabin good for you and your significant other for a romantic getaway
1181,17,A fantastic cabin with great history. Would recommend this to anyone.
1182,17,"Such a cute, cozy and charming cabin! The cabin feels very secluded but is close to Cape Fear River Adventures, a sports bar and brewery. Hosts were great. I would stay here again!"
1183,17,good
1184,17,"What a sensational piece of history! If you've never stayed in an authentic log cabin, here's your chance. It's just rustic enough that you feel transported, but has all of the comforts of home. The hosts were very responsive, accommodating and knowledgeable about the area."
1185,17,"An absolutely wonderful place to stay. Check-in was easy and fast, the hosts were very attentive and nice. We loved the back porch and the loft. Pray for rain during your stay…the sound on the roof is heavenly…such a relaxing getaway."
1186,17,We are glad that you had a relaxing time. Thank u for your review.
1187,17,Unique experience for the area. Recommend to those who are looking for a cabin/nature experience.
1188,17,Thank you for your recommendation. Also thank you for keeping the space so clean. I hope you had a delightful stay.
1189,17,We booked the cabin on our way back from a cross country road trip and were very happy with our stay. The cabin was perfect for the 2 of us and we were pleasantly surprised by the redone bathroom and enjoyed walking around the grounds.
1190,17,This garden/cabin is a beautiful and historical treasure. Thank you so much for your care and hospitality. I can’t wait to return.
1191,17,"Had a good time staying in the historical log cabin. While it may not be for everyone’s taste, we found it to be a pleasant adventure. Enjoy the experience, like living in the TV show “Outlander”. Only with indoor plumbing and air conditioning."
1192,17,We booked this trip to go hiking at raven rock. Great location beautiful Airbnb for a couple or anyone looking for a little adventure. Amy is the best host we've ever had when booking with Airbnb. I highly recommend and would come back.
1193,17,"Very novel little place, interesting stat, fair value not as private as we expected"
1194,17,"Amy and Bill were responsive to any requests and followed through in a timely manner. If you like fancy, this is not the place. If you like charm, character, unique experiences and an authentic one of a kind cabin, you will love this. I would stay here again and the price was a great value. I highly recommend it."
1195,17,Amy has nice hidden country getaway highly recommend
1196,18,"Great quiet, calming, relaxing, get away spot."
1197,18,The perfect secluded weekend getaway. The space was more beautiful than the pictures!
1198,18,Cute little place. Wonderful location. The outside seating areas are lovely and we really enjoyed the hot tub. The bed was super comfy and we had everything we needed.
1199,18,This tiny home away from home was perfect for our quick 2 night stop over on our way back home FL to PA. Super cozy and I was obsessed with the well thought out design and decor down to the matching fixture and wood colors inside and out. So much though was put into it. We loved the hot tub on the high hill even in the rain cause it’s covered by an umbrella. Beautiful view and we cooked indoors and out on the grill. Our first container stay and you’ve set the bar! 10/10 thanks for the beautiful stay!
1200,18,"Such a cute little place! I went alone for my birthday weekend for a little R&R and had the best time! I had coffee on the top deck to catch the sun rise, and a nice glass of wine by the Hot Tub for the sunset."
1201,18,"This was a wonderful spot. Just enough room, plenty of outdoor seating, and the hot tub was awesome. Only took about 15 minutes to get to any stores. It was private, had beautiful trees, and very clean. Would definitely recommend!"
1202,18,Amazing stay! Definitely will do it again!
1203,18,Gorgeous tiny living to have a perfect quiet get away!
1204,18,Enjoyed the weekend greatly. Everything felt clean and organized.
1205,18,We had an amazing stay at Stan and Bry's place! Everything was as described. Check in check out was smooth. The place is super cute and cozy :)
1206,18,This tiny escape was fantastic! I'm so glad we booked it. It looked just like the photos and was super cozy. The hot tub was great and the view was beautiful.
1207,18,"This tiny escape was perfect! So cute, clean, and quiet. We will definitely be back!"
1208,18,"Beautiful place, tucked away and private. Jacuzzi was perfect in the cold nights and the Airbnb had everything you needed to make yourself feel cozy and relaxed. Will definitely look to return!"
1209,18,Great stay!
1210,18,Was a amazing deal. Perfect relaxing weekend.
1211,18,"Stan and Bry were wonderful hosts. They answered all questions quickly and were always making sure we had everything we needed. There was a small maintenance hiccup just prior to our arrival which they alerted us to beforehand and fixed quickly without any intrusion to us or disruption in our stay. We absolutely recommend this spot and can't wait to visit their other ""tiny spaces"" locations."
1212,18,Thank you so much for the opportunity to stay at the Tiny house. Such a low stress - no worries experience from start to finish. I appreciate the vision that Stan & Bry presented 1st hand. So much innovation and craftsmanship were noticeable in the sustainable home. The views and privacy on this property were incredible.
1213,18,Had the best time this weekend…close to Boone and other towns we wanted to visit. The tiny house was perfect and had everything we needed. Can’t wait to visit one of the other tiny escapes y’all own.
1214,18,"We really enjoyed our relaxing stay at the tiny sustainer! The place is kept very clean and the outdoor space is wonderful. Although it was raining most of our trip, we had some cozy movie nights, enjoyed the views, and still had a great time. Stan and Bry are great hosts and we will definitely book with them again in the future!"
1215,18,This place is amazing! Beautiful area and quiet and peaceful. Great place to get away and disconnect! Would recommend to anyone looking for a unique and romantic getaway! Thank you Stan and Bry!
1216,18,Great unique stay! Only commit to staying with someone you want to be close to lol. It’s 160 square feet but absolutely beautiful! The outside areas added so much abs perfect for a romantic get away! Plan on eating out meals. Only way to cook or heat food is double burner. Would absolutely recommend and Stan was very responsive to questions!
1217,18,"We had an amazing time at Stan and Bry's container home. The setting was gorgeous. The home itself was very nice, but we mainly enjoyed the exterior features and how beautifully designed everything was from all the different seating areas (especially the area on top of the home), the fire pits, the hot tub, etc. We had a wonderful hike one morning up the mountain behind the home and went into West Jefferson twice, which is a quaint little town with cool shops and restaurants only 10 minutes away. Thanks Stan and Bry for such an enjoyable getaway."
1218,18,"We had such a wonderful, restful time her! We arrived the first night when it was dark, the outdoor lights were on and welcoming! Easy, clear instructions made checking in and out a breeze! The view from the hot tub in November was beautiful!"
1219,18,Fun place to stay. Very clean and nice property
1220,18,This place is awesome! We thoroughly enjoyed our time and the host were absolutely wonderful and so easy to communicate with! You will not want to miss out on this opportunity!
1221,18,The coziest place for just my husband and I! So close to West Jefferson for shopping and fun! Stan and Bry communicated so well. We couldn’t have asked for a better vacation and we have already booked our next one with them!
1222,18,"Stan and Bry’s Tiny home was beautiful and very well equipped with everything you needed. The property was easy to find with directions provided. Stan and Bry had very good communication, and even though we were there for only 2 nights they reached out to make sure all was ok and if we had any questions.
Great stay overall :)"
1223,18,Awesome!
1224,18,"We had a dream get away, from the quaintness of the container, to the landscape we felt relaxed the moment we got there. We definitely plan to come back to this magical little space!!"
1225,18,Very fun stay at this tiny home! It was my first time in a small space but the hosts designed the place for organization and comfort. We used all the amenities and everything is accurate to the listing. On two mornings we got to watch a herd of deer walk through the woods. Very idyllic. I would stay here or at the other properties that Stan & Bry have.
1226,18,"Stan and Bry were fantastic! The property was awesome. Super clean, and a very special and unique place to relax! Highly recommend!"
1227,18,"My husband and I drove down and spent 2 days in the Tiny Sustainer. It was just what we needed after his deployment! It was perfectly located to go out and do things, but also still very private and had beautiful scenery!"
1228,18,Beautiful “escape” from the hustle and bustle of every-day-life. The only con was that the property was closer to the highway than we expected. So there was noise pollution (cars driving by) when we were sitting on the top deck. We paid a premium for less indoor space but ample outdoor space. We did book through AirBnB (and not directly through Tiny Escapes) and it was during peak fall season. The sustainer home windows are placed perfectly so you can enjoy viewing the outdoors from the comfort of inside. Communication with Stan & Bry was prompt and efficient. Everything was well thought out/planned and very well built. We will definitely be coming back to this Tiny Escape and their other properties!
1229,18,"You won’t be disappointed by booking here! What a neat experience! Lots of privacy, lots of great outdoor space, we didn’t even leave for the entire weekend!"
1230,18,Enjoyed my stay! The view is great and private! Towns not too far away to do some grocery shopping for look around. I would stay here again.
1231,18,"If you are looking for a remote quiet getaway this is the place. It is just the right size for two ppl to enjoy some relaxation and quiet. Also, there is plenty of outdoor space to enjoy. The fire pit at night was the best."
1232,18,Great place to stay.
1233,18,This place was UNREAL! I can’t say enough wonderful things. Gave me ideas on creating my own tiny home space 😊
1234,18,This place is pretty nice! Awesome time there!
1235,18,"We had the most amazing weekend getaway! This “tiny escape” was gorgeous, quiet and secluded. The outdoor space was absolutely stunning and the hot tub was a special treat! I also learned how to use a French press and I was pretty excited about the outcome!"
1236,18,Awesome relaxing place.
1237,18,Gorgeous. Private. Full of amenities. This is as pictures describe. I needed a weekend away in the mountains and got all that. Do nothing or do everything; either way your path is as you choose. Stan & Bry were beyond helpful and communicative. I’ll be back.
1238,18,"Wonderful slice of paradise. Despite rainy weather everyday, we loved the Sustainer. A great home base to explore all that the mountains have to offer."
1239,18,Perfect stay and perfect hosts! Awesome tiny home.
1240,18,We absolutely loved our weekend away here!
1241,18,I needed a peaceful getaway for the weekend. Stan and Bry’s shipping container was amazing. It was so peaceful and relaxing. The privacy was amazing. The tiny home was very clean and so efficiently built. The bed was very comfortable. It was an unforgettable experience and I highly recommend. They were also super quick to respond and great about checking in with us.
1242,18,Stan and Bry are amazing hosts and we had the most amazing stay! Whenever we had questions the response was always timely. As far as the space itself goes everything was beautiful. The location is stunning and gives a great amount of privacy. There was also anything you could ever need as far as cookwear and ammenities right there at your disposal. We would 100% stay again and recommend to anyone considering a stay at one of their properties!
1243,18,"Beautiful!! This tiny place was a seriously great find. All the outdoor seating areas and the hot tub were a huge plus. It was surrounded by the trees - it felt like a very private little get away. We had no issues with the wifi. Pack lightly as far as refrigerated food/drinks go, keep in mind there is only room for a mini fridge in the container. We stayed in July and the A/C worked great. Thank you Stan and Bry!"
1244,18,"This place was amazing, it was perfect for my wife and I to relax and unwind away from the city. The hot tub was wonderful on the cool mornings. Waking up every morning to the sun barely peaking up and sitting on the deck on top of the sustainer listening to the birds and watching the deer run through the woods was the greatest start to every morning. Stan and Bry we wonderful hosts, my wife and I have already started looking at some of their places for rentals next year we will definitely be back."
1245,18,Had an amazing time. The best part is the privacy and scenery.
1246,18,"The lovely Tiny Sustainer was such a comfortable place to stay. From the design to the execution they truly built a beautiful mountain getaway. Located in the middle of West Jefferson and Boone, this Airbnb was definitely a wonderful experience."
1247,18,Awesome place! You will not be disappointed. Steep drive but so worth it! :)
1248,18,"This place is absolutely magical! Everything is as advertised, and even better in person! Great location in the mountains of North Carolina. We spent a day white water rafting and an afternoon of horseback riding and this tiny home was perfect to come back to in the afternoon to relax in the hot tub and grill our dinners. It’s hard to say which part of this AirBnb was our favorite as they were all great . We enjoyed coffee on the upper deck in the morning, an afternoon nap in the hammock, and a late night fire around the fire table. Best of all though had to be the hot tub area with its rope lights setting the perfect ambiance to end the day. I cannot say enough great things about this place! Communication from Stan and Bry was great and always prompt. The only thing I would change next time is to stay longer!"
1249,18,"The Tiny Sustainer is truly unique and a very memorable place to stay. It's really amazing how much has been done to convert a standard metal shipping container into a super cool tiny living space. The design is well thought out and the attention to detail is remarkable. Everything two people need for a nice getaway is included inside this space. The shower was cozy and steamy and the bed was luxurious.
On the outside, there are so many decks and seating spots that you'll never be bored. The hot tub, hammock, gas fire table, the wood fire pit, and a few other seating areas are all so thoughtfully provided and arranged. It was especially interesting to use the deck on top of the house for a different perspective!
I'd highly recopmmend the Tiny Sustainer for a great trip away from the ordinary."
1250,18,"Lovely getaway with an easy drive to Boone.
The home is very clean, and is perfectly stocked for a fun weekend away."
1251,18,"We stayed at Stan and Bry’s for our minimoon, and it was the perfect setting for relaxing. Even with the rain we made the most of the amenities and accessibility to West Jefferson and Boone. We had a really nice time and can’t wait to stay in the forest again!"
1252,18,The Tiny Sustainer is adorable. It’s was exceptionally clean with a well thought out design. Check in was a breeze communication was easy. No complaints!
1253,18,"Perfect little hideaway into the mountains, great location for a peaceful place to stay away from the hustle and bustle but close enough to near by attractions to drive to. The best of both worlds! Highly recommend"
1254,18,"The container home is very beautiful and private, and perfect for a weekend getaway for two! Lots of planning went into developing the site obviously and Ashe county is beautiful! Would definitely stay here again!"
1255,18,You will not be disappointed
1256,18,Everything was exactly as described! We enjoyed the hot tub especially since it was cold and snowing! 10/10 would recommend.
1257,18,We loved our stay in this converted shipping container! We planned to be outside most of the time and this location was perfect for that! The hot tub and rooftop deck were perfect places to relax after hiking a trail nearby! We fell in love with the area and can’t wait to come back again!
1258,18,What an awesome place!! Diamond in the rough!!! Can’t wait to visit their other rentals too!
1259,18,This place was amazing!
1260,18,"We loved every minute of our stay here. We even extended our stay by one evening because we did not want to leave. Everything is accurately described and as pictured. Stan & Bry are great hosts and truly thought of everything. The fire pit & jacuzzi are the perfect additions to this tiny home. Water was hot, bed was incredibly comfy! The entire place was very clean & so cozy! Definitely one of the best places we’ve stayed. We did not want to go home and can’t wait to return. Perfect weekend getaway in the mountains! Thank you Stan & Bry for making this trip wonderful!"
1261,18,"Top tier relaxing getaway! Exactly what we needed to unplug and relax. We spent most of our time grilling and in the hot tub! Super clean and super cute! Highly recommend to everyone considering. If you’re looking for an outdoor adventure with hiking nearby, this place is great!"
1262,18,"The Tiny Sustainer is the dream getaway. With 2 decks to choose from to enjoy your morning coffee or late night popcorn, a grill and a fireplace, it’s the perfect hangout. The hot tub is really special set up on a deck all its own with string lights above to set a relaxing mood.
The tiny house itself is perfectly stocked with just the things you will need. It’s clean, minimalistic and makes the perfect, relaxing getaway. The hosts are very quick to communicate and very helpful."
1263,18,"Stan and Bry’s place was so lovely. It was exactly how it was described and the space was beautiful. Stan and Bry were great hosts and made sure to check that everything was okay with us during our stay. The bed was so comfortable and the home was very cozy. Also, the hot tub was so nice and it was a great spot to stargaze. I definitely recommend this place for a perfect mountain getaway and hope to stay there again someday."
1264,18,Beautiful retreat for a weekend getaway in the mountains!
1265,18,Awesome experience!
1266,18,"Most amazing get away, don’t think think twice about it, just do it like Nike!"
1267,18,"Stan & Bry are great! They furnished a cute, cozy, and beautiful place to stay for our 14th wedding anniversary! It was such a great place and full of tranquility and peacefulness! It was such an easy check in and check out with clear communication the whole time! They even checked in to make sure the stay was great! The location was great and not far to Boone. Thank you again and would fully recommend this great gem!!!"
1268,18,"Very cute, clean, and great tiny little sustainer. It sits on top of a hill so views in the morning and afternoon are really great. The large windows in the sustainer make it feel so much bigger than it is. Bed was extremely comfortable and bathroom was the perfect size. Not only is it a short drive to Boone but also West Jefferson, which is a cute little town with plenty of restaurants and shops.

The hosts were extremely accommodating as well since we had to rebook due to weather. We had a great time and honestly can’t wait to check out their other locations in the future!"
1269,18,"This place is amazing. It is located in a private and beautiful location on the top of the hill with a lovely view. The place is clean and well maintained. There is everything you can possibly need- fully equipped kitchen, fire pit, grill, hot tub and so much more. I would definitely recommend- it’s perfect for couples. We hope to be back again soon!"
1270,18,Super cool property! Thoroughly enjoyed it!
1271,18,This place was amazing! I love the location! The place was beautiful! Would definitely stay again!!!!
1272,18,"The place is amazing! The house is spectacular! Great location. Far from other houses. Is modern, cozy and with a good taste of design. The kitchen has every you need. The view es absolutely amazing! Hot tub, hot water, heater, everything in good conditions! Almost everything Organic! Even the towels smell good. If you are a couple, you definitely should stay in this place and the ski mountains are not so far, 40minutes and the travel ir confortable. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ for this place ♥️ I’ll come back and stay at the other tiny homes that they have!"
1273,18,"I haven't rented many listings on Airbnb, maybe three to four collectively. All I can say is that this property created one of my favorite experiences for partner and myself. It is by far one of our favorite stays we've ever booked. We loved every detail that Stan and Bry included in this beautifully minimalistic container. It's perfectly situated in its own tiny forest with a beautiful view seen from every deck. The location is perfect, if you're looking for a primitive stay with a short drive to Boone. We enjoyed this stay so much that we changed our original plans to visit Boone and West Jefferson and decided to stay at the container for the remainder of our trip. Since we went during January, we got to snowshoe up the property after a snowstorm and enjoy the view of the mountain range even more. We cooked many delicious meals, thanks to the plethora of cookware and cutlery provided. The jacuzzi was by far our favorite amenity of the property, surrounded by strings of lights. During our stay, Stan and Bry were prompt at getting back to our questions and concerns. They are incredibly personable, welcoming, and professional. The container is extremely well kept and clean, in addition to a well maintained driveway. We hope to rent this space and again, as well as Stan and Bry's other listings! If you're looking for a forest getaway that offers minimalism, seclusion, and beauty, this is the one you need to experience!"
1274,18,Perfect LITTLE getaway! My wife and I stayed for our honeymoon and loved it! Very unique space to relax and hang out in between adventures in the surrounding towns. West Jefferson being right down the road is super nice and a great town to spend the day in! Hot tub was amazing. Very well kept and designed! Would stay here again!
1275,18,Such a beautiful place and the owners were very responsive and quick!
1276,18,"Great hosts, fast communication, take care of you while providing privacy! Everything from location, to checking in, to providing everything we needed. The spot was perfect for two people. For a getaway weekend, it was THE spot. We’ll definitely be coming back. Thank you again for such a modern and wonderful place as well as being great hosts."
1277,18,"We had an amazing time away and didn't leave our whole stay! There are lots of sitting areas, beautiful views, and we saw so many deer. Definitely coming back!"
1278,18,Great NYE retreat and awesome couple!
1279,18,"Great little place! Super clean, very cool set up and had everything we needed. Stan & Bry were also awesome about making sure everything was good and answering any questions. We definitely had a fun time there!"
1280,18,Stan & Bry’s place so the perfect get away for a couple or a single traveler trying to relax or maybe get some writing done. It’s Situated at the top of a hill and has amazing views of sunrise. The hot tub is perfectly situated and brand new. The tiny home smells of fresh pine upon entering and everything is spotless and new. All the amenities you could need other than an oven. They even leave coffee and tea for their guests.
1281,18,Great place I recommended everybody
1282,18,"I cannot recommend the Tiny Sustainer enough! The location was a perfect mix of “off the grid” but still very close to grocery stores, other necessities, and great towns to visit. The property is so well designed with steps and walkways to the hot tub and other amenities. Stan and Bry were super helpful and checked in with us over text multiple times throughout our stay. If you’re thinking about booking, absolutely do so!"
1283,18,Very attentive hosts. Amazing amenities and great surroundings area.
1284,18,"Wonderful stay! Beautiful, and such a great experience. Amazing hosts, checked in us throughout our stay and we’re communicative and accommodating!"
1285,18,"We had the best experience! The place was clean, cute and well organized. The large windows were perfect to enjoy a few cozy days in the woods. This retreat was just what we needs and so fun! The nearby towns weren’t too far away and it was quite fun to go back to the secluded location up the hill. We felt safe and didn’t mind the steep driveway. I highly recommend this tiny home escape."
1286,18,We had a great stay! Very comfy bed and space. The hot tub was nice and relaxing! We had a lot of fun exploring Boone near by.
1287,18,"This place was beautiful and clean. I recommend to anyone who is thinking about going, it’s a great time! Bed is comfy, hot tub is incredible. I loved the fire pit and the grill!"
1288,18,Such a cute tiny house!! Very peaceful to sit outside and enjoy our drinks or just relax in the hot tub! 10/10 would recommend staying at this tiny house :)
1289,18,Tiny house is absolutely beautiful! Highly recommended.
1290,18,A great relaxing stay !!!! I highly recommend booking Stan and Bry tiny home experience
1291,18,This place was amazing! The whole set up was wonderful and the hot tub was the cherry on top! Definitely would come back again!
1292,18,"The stay was amazing! The location was perfect.
My husband and I were amazed on the cleanness inside and outside of the container, Stan & bry really take the best care of this place! We saw some deer which made our trip extra special, this was the most magical get away experience for you and your person if you’re looking to escape. Stan & bry were always available for our questions prior to our stay. We highly recommend picking this magical spot and we will be back soon!"
1293,18,This is a great place to come and stay... we enjoyed the two days
1294,19,We enjoyed our stay.
1295,19,Very nice being immersed in nature
1296,19,"This place was so peaceful and relaxing. There were times we just sat there and listened to the silence.

Linda was an amazing host and very communicative. She greeted us upon arrival and took the time to walk us through the entire property and amenities included.

I would highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a peaceful getaway that feels like glamping!!!"
1297,19,I took my my Boyfriend here for a birthday surprise and it was magically wonderful! Linda and Steve were super nice and friendly and had such an awesome space with beautiful art and poetry surrounding the property. We are already talking about coming back can't wait to visit again!
1298,19,"Thanks, Linda & Steve! The yurt was a beautiful overnight escape and we loved the hot tub and beautiful surroundings."
1299,19,"this was the second time i've stayed at the yurt on frog pond and i'll definitely go back again!
it's such a calming place : )
love Saxapahaw!"
1300,19,Incredible as always!
1301,19,"This was our 2nd visit. We love it and will be back! The place is very unique, the grounds are beautiful, and the back deck is very cozy. We enjoyed the fire pit and hot tub! We highly recommend a stay here!"
1302,19,"This was our second time here - we couldn’t stay away! Love this place so very much; Linda and her family (pups and chicks and geese included) are always warm and wonderful and I can’t say enough how much of a gem staying here is.
Thank you so, so much for the peace and needed away space."
1303,19,A fantastic place to stay!
1304,19,"A beautiful, relaxing, and cozy staycation! Loved the wood stove and hot tub. Also, the noon checkout time was AMAZING. Loved being able to wake up late and take the morning slow. Great hosts, great location, great trip!"
1305,19,Our host was very responsive to our messages and offered advice on the weather conditions before we arrived. The descriptions are accurate this is a very peaceful somewhat remote stay and we would definitely come back to stay again!
1306,19,"This is an absolutely lovely and peaceful place to stay. The surroundings are beautiful and the yurt is filled with art and treasures, that add to the eclectic, relaxing environment. I truly cannot recommend this stay enough!
Linda and her partner are both kind and welcoming. They gave clear, helpful directions and were very polite.

Thank you for sharing your beautiful yurt with us, Linda! We are so grateful!"
1307,19,The Yurt at Frog Pond is a peaceful outdoor experience. we loved keeping warm by the fire and in the hot tub. It's quite the romantic getaway. If you love camping in the forest then you'll love this glamping experience. P.S. don't forget your camp stove!
1308,19,"We can’t wait to return to this special place! Thanks so much Linda and crew, you all have created such a beautiful space to share with others and we are so grateful. Words won’t do it justice, you have to go experience it for yourself to understand the magic."
1309,19,"Wonderful retreat in nature, exactly what I needed for relaxing before a new job. The location was very private and peaceful. Overall, the hosts were flexible, communicative, and provided great instructions for my stay."
1310,19,"The yurt is very peaceful and relaxing, will definitely come back. It rained the weekend we were there so we couldn't enjoy the property as much but listening to the rain fall on the yurt with the fire going was very relaxing. Great food close by and Red Oak Brewery is not a far drive which was a nice place to hang out on a rainy day."
1311,19,"We love staying here! I enjoy the beautiful nature all around, peaceful wind chimes and of course the hot tub :) Clean, comfortable space with everything needed to have a nice fire in the wood stove."
1312,19,Had a great stay. Unique place in a peaceful environment. Wonderful hosts. Would definitely return!
1313,19,"My partner and I wanted a midweek getaway to decompress and be in nature. We regularly camp, travel and hike. We also were hoping for a spot to not only help us rest our bones and minds, but that would also inspire us artistically. This space was exactly that. And the hot tub was amazing. The yurt is well tended to and cozy. As animal lovers, we were thrilled too share space with the dogs, chickens, and roosters-we especially bonded with Cher, the goose. The poetry walks were simple and peaceful. All around lovely. Plus being really close to the haw river and the local shops was really convenient for quick access items. Our hosts were kind and respectful, giving us lots of space while also leaving us to feel very supported for anything we might need. Looking forward to going back! Highly recommend"
1314,19,"This was such a wonderful gift. My partner and I work hard and long, hectic hours - we booked this for Valentine’s Day to have a bit of peace alone and without all the noise and busy-braining.
The farm and woodland area was so inviting and beautiful, the yurt was like a home in a storybook and we were absolutely giddy about it; we immediately felt at peace and so comfortable.
Linda provide anything and everything we needed, gave us space and answers to questions without us even asking.
The amenities here, if you are anything like us city-snatched nature lovers, are more than perfect. We had a bright starlit night sky, the warmth of many fires and the romantic light of torches over the pond. We had tons of comfortable blankets to snuggle into to sleep and woke to sweet little dogs and the chirrups of chickens and so much lovely land that I think we fell in love with everything and everybody in that moment, truly.
Such an amazing stay. I’m so, so happy we experienced this. Thank you!"
1315,19,"Loved every minute of it and cant wait to go back again. Make sure you give Gracie, Garret, and Al lots of love and dont forget about Chery the Goose! Shes a great conversationalist!"
1316,19,"We have stayed at Yurt on Frog Pond before, it gets better each time. Very peaceful, relaxing, and spiritual. It is now our little piece of heaven, and reminds us of a place we used to stay in Big Sur, California. I know that we will be back again and again. Linda, Steven and their gentle dogs, have created a gorgeous, blissful, artful, place of dreams and serenity. A++"
1317,19,"We had a wonderful time staying at Linda and Steven's yurt. It was supposed to be a freezing night but once you get the wood stove running and soak in that glorious hot tub you get as cozy as can be. The hosts are so friendly and welcoming and tell you all about the space and how to work things, they are also extremely easy to communicate with if you need them. This yurt is less than an hour from where we live but it provides a peaceful escape into the woods. Would absolutely stay again."
1318,19,"We love the yurt and have been coming for a few years now! It’s the perfect distance from the Triangle to feel like you’re getting away without having to take any time off work, we love being able to pop over to Saxapahaw for dinner and Pittsboro for thrift and art shopping, and the yurt itself is so peaceful and funky and cozy."
1319,19,"The yurt was exactly how Mrs.Linda described it. Had everything that you needed, including wood and extra blankets. The hot tub was amazing especially at night. Wish we had more time to stay and enjoy the poetry walk and pond. Already planning another trip . Thank you so much!"
1320,19,Completely as advertised! We had a peaceful stay. Had never stayed in a yurt and it was truly enjoyable. Winter hot tub is excellent on a full moon in the woods!!
1321,19,The yurt at Frog Pond Farm is a special place. Our stay was cut short but we had a super relaxing time and look forward to escaping to the yurt in the future.
1322,19,Great place to stay! Loved the property and easy to find. Would recommend!
1323,19,It was so cozy and perfect for a quick getaway with the person you love! We wish we could have taken all the dogs home with us!
1324,19,Good place to stay. Not private enough for a romantic weekend though.
1325,19,"This was such an incredible experience! We had never stayed in a Yurt before and this was the perfect first time! The hot tub was fantastic and great way to wind down the night. The hot tub had a bed in it! It stayed very hot which was so nice because it was really cold outside. The Yurt actually held a fair amount of heat and we were provided plenty of extra blankets and pillows for comfort which was extremely appreciated. We didn’t get to the poetry walk because of our plans and the rain but from what we could see it looked beautiful from the yurt! The puppies were so sweet. Can’t forget about Mr. Goose in the pond! He was very talkative and made sure everyone knew how important he was! It was hilarious. Overall it was a peaceful little get away, and definitely served a cozy night! Absolutely worth every penny."
1326,19,Lovely stay!
1327,19,"I am amazed to have found such a peaceful getaway just a half hour drive from where I live. I can't wait to continue going back. Linda was there to greet and situate me. The yurt was spacious and cozy and had all the amenities I needed. The wood-burning stove kept me toasty in cold weather. The deck overlooking the pond was very relaxing. The bathhouse was extremely clean. And the hot tub connected to the yurr topped it all off. The town of Saxapahaw is just a few minutes away by car and has a great coffee shop, general store, etc. Thank you, Linda. I look forward to returning."
1328,19,Really good place & host.
1329,19,"Only stayed one night as a quick trip/get away for our anniversary . Everything was as stated. Very nice yurt and surroundings . Poetry walk was nice touch . I like camping and my husband, not so much . So , we decided to try glamping and the yurt didn’t disappoint . We’d definitely come back and hopefully stay longer than one night . Nice restaurant close to stay also ."
1330,19,"This was such a peaceful, beautiful stay in a magical place. It was a lovely escape even if it was just for a night. Linda was very helpful and does a great job getting you oriented. The yurt is cozy with so much charm. We were unsure of how to operate the hot tub and got unlucky trying to start a fire in the wood stove, but nonetheless we enjoyed our stay and hope to come back for a longer trip."
1331,19,"Large Yurt in Rural Rustic Woody Setting. Linda was a kind and helpful host. We enjoyed the camping experience and the wood burning stove for the chilly nights. We took our daughters over to Saxapahaw, Alamance and Graham for the weekend for fun activities. We had a fun get-away weekend."
1332,19,"My partner and I had a wonderful two-night stay in the Yurt at Frog Pond! The property was very peaceful and a nice escape from the city. Linda and Steven were very responsive, accommodating, and welcoming. She shared the history of the property and Saxapahaw, and recommended some things to do and places to eat (which were outstanding!). We also appreciated how respectful they were of our privacy. The poetry and art walk was truly a delight. It was very chilly at night in November, but the wood stove, extra blankets, and hot tub kept us quite warm. Their dogs were also very friendly.

We had such a lovely time that we have already discussed coming back next year. Thank you, Linda and Steve!"
1333,19,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The dogs and artwork were a treat.
1334,19,"The yurt and property was amazing - gorgeous this time of year. I can imagine it is very beautiful thorough the winter, spring, and summer as well! You’re truly in nature, the views were definitely impressive. Everything is red and orange at this time of year! The hot tub was GREAT. Can’t beat a hot tub with perfect fall weather. Stars at night were also impressive!
The yurt is as described and the art and poetry walk was a nice touch. The poems are quality! Don’t miss out on that.
Bathroom is completely finished, no issues at all.
The hosts were very helpful with a quick tour to start the trip (even in the rain!) and gave us a thorough run down of the area and all the logistics.

I dont think the back door of the yurt locks (unless we were doing something wrong lol) so that would be the only thing worth noting.

Yurt is fully stocked, coffee / blankets / towels / etc!

Would def stay again :)))"
1335,19,Thank you for the great communication and lovely little oasis!
1336,19,A beautiful spot in the woods for a relaxing get away! Linda was an incredible host. The yurt was clean and as advertised. We will be back again!
1337,19,This is the 3rd time staying here and it never disappoints!
1338,19,"This place exceeded my expectations in so many ways! I came prepared with things I thought I should bring for a ‘camping type’ experience, but this was truly glamping, and everything I could have thought about and more was already there. The yurt was cozy and comfortable, the hot tub was VERY CLEAN and it was super relaxing to enjoy the beauty of the woods and the pond from that vantage point. The animals were well behaved and friendly, and the hosts were quick to respond to messages, and were available but gave us lots of privacy the whole time. I recommend this place 100%"
1339,19,"Can't find a better or kinder place to stay. Linda and her husband are welcoming and available if you have questions. If you are unfamiliar with the area - they have plenty of local info in the Yurt.

We always come away feeling relaxed."
1340,19,"Calm getaway. Very private quiet rustic serene property with beautiful nature surrounding. Plan to make friends with the charming dogs, chickens, and goose. Linda and her husband were very polite"
1341,19,"We really enjoyed our stay. The yurt is well stocked and decorated, has an amazing deck overlooking the pond, and the hot tub was perfectly illuminated by the tiki lights."
1342,19,"The yurt was everything I could’ve asked for and more. Access to nature all around, yet with a roof and walls. I plan to go again and again for rest and time away. Highly recommend"
1343,19,The yurt at frog pond is a very relaxing peaceful stay. Hot tub is wonderful. Linda has a lot of books and board games available to play. Going into town for dinner and a hike is fun. Linda responds quickly and takes good care of you.
1344,19,"We enjoyed our unique stay at the yurt! Linda was very friendly and showed me around. We enjoyed the poetry walk. At night, we did have lots of acorns fall on the yurt making it hard to sleep but to be expected in a yurt! We thought it was a cool experience. Super close to Haw River Ballroom."
1345,19,"It was a great night away. Pretty location looking over the small pond. It didn't get too cold, so the firepit outside and blankets inside worked out great. The wood-burning stove inside made the morning nice and warm. The acorns were falling and banging on the yurt roof and the tin roofs of the other buildings, so it was a little bit of ongoing bombardment, but you're in the woods, so that's to be expected this time of year."
1346,19,Great place to stay! It was unique and very peaceful. Everything is exactly as it states! Would definitely recommend!
1347,19,"Staying in a yurt was a first for me and my husband, and it was even cozier and roomier than we expected. Linda and Steve provide everything you need while there, including disposable dishes and cutlery, drinking water, fire starting materials, towels, and plenty of comforters, books, DVDs, games, and lights for ambiance. There are so many things on shelves and tables to explore and learn from. The poetry walk was fun and inspiring and the dogs and chickens were delightful. We feel like we've discovered such a gem, especially since it's only an hour from our home. We're visiting again in May with our adult daughters and looking forward to making more memories."
1348,19,"SUCH a marvelous hidden gem. Not too far out from the city, but feels like you're in the mountains. Yurt is incredibly spacious but cozy (holiday lights ftw!), hot tub is decadent, fire pit by the pond is lovely (and had everything you needed to light a fire provided!). Had a very comfortable stay. The advertised 2 min walk to the bathroom is probably overstating it - it's more like 30 seconds and really not much of a hassle besides having to put on shoes. The one thing I might recommend to folks is to bring a pack of water bottles or a gallon jug or two. Water is provided (thank you!), but if you need a large quantity of it to make some coffee or tea (or to douse the fire pit), pumping it out can take a bit of time. Other than that minor bit, everything is pretty perfect! Great for glamping :)"
1349,19,"Me and my twin 9 year olds thoroughly enjoyed our two day get away. The yurt was cozy, yet gave a roughing it edge that felt like an adventure. Blankets were cozy, fire pit and pond were idyllic, goose, chickens and dogs were charming. Hot tub in fall weather made the trip. We are really glad we stayed. Plus the hosts are very charming."
1350,19,"Out in The middle of the woods, beautiful surroundings – this was such a great getaway!
The yurt was very cozy & comfortable. Accomodations were exactly as described & everything you need.
Linda & Steve were very welcoming and nice. (As were Garrett, Gracie & Alan! 🐾🐾🐾) Had a great time with my 3 granddaughters and will definitely go back!"
1351,19,This is a hidden gem (literally)! We had a lovely time as a family - there is something for everyone. The yurt is spacious and beautiful and we literally spent hours in the outdoor patio with the views of the frog pond and campfire. Steve and Linda are wonderful hosts and their poetry walk is a unique experience in the woods. We would highly recommend this stay!
1352,19,"We had a wonderful stay, the property was beautiful and close to a lot of restaurants and the river if you want to canoe or kayak!"
1353,19,This was just what my family needed! A private way to go glamping and spend some time in nature as well as the hot tub:)
1354,19,"A wonderful hideaway / getaway from it all! The Yurt at Frog Pond was just the thing we needed to have a peaceful weekend getaway to connect with nature and each other! The Yurt is much bigger than we anticipated from the pictures -- A nice surprise and really a great stay. The only reason I didn't rate everything total 5 stars is the bathroom could've been a little cleaner -- but you are camping, so just keep that in mind!

We will most definitely be back to this gem in the woods outside of Saxapahaw - especially b/c of the fact it is close by!

Thanks to Linda and Steve for being wonderful hosts!!"
1355,19,"This place is absolutely amazing! We had a very relaxing and quiet stay. The hosts are extremely kind and talented artists, and we will definitely return."
1356,19,Great hosts. They answered all our questions about yurt living. The yurt is quite roomy inside. I would stay there again in the fall when the temp is not so hot and humid. The fans helped but it was warm. Beds clean and comfy. The hot tub in the woods was extra enjoyable.
1357,19,Beautiful property! Owners were very friendly and welcoming :)
1358,19,Linda provided us such a welcoming and warming environment. I loved the yurt! Highly recommend for those staying in the Chapel Hill area but want to get away in beautiful scenery.
1359,19,"Really enjoyed a short stay at this yurt. It's definitely a unique experience. A thunderstorm was an unexpected bonus experience 😅. Linda was very welcoming and showed me around and how to work everything.
It was very hot outside while I visited (August). I had all the fans running and that helped a lot. Overnight the temperature was fine, it was rather warm between noon and 4pm, so I suggest visiting sights during that time (highly recommend the coffee shop, brewery, General Store and The Eddy in Saxapahaw).
Saxapahaw is an unexpected gem full of small town charm and community."
1360,19,Wonderful stay! Lots of frogs & huge spiders. Be ready to get cozy!
1361,19,View of the pond was amazing!! Great host!!
1362,19,Great place to stay! Incredibly beautiful and charming. Linda and Steve are also very friendly and creative people! Check out their art if you stay! ❤️
1363,19,This spot is so charming. I had a lovely quiet evening listening to the frogs and locusts. I woke up to geese and chickens that were just beautiful. wish I had company and more time!
1364,19,"A quiet refuge with lovely sunsets, sounds of nature, and lovable dogs."
1365,19,"This yurt is exactly as described. We had a peaceful stay with rain keeping the heat at bay. The steady pitterpatter of the rain with the gentle goings-ons of the animals nearby really transport you into a different world. Despite the rainfall, there was plenty of tree cover to wander the trails and woods comfortably without getting wet.

Our hosts were friendly, and had a wonderful array of stories! We loved seeing their artwork and self-expression throughout the property and fully recommend others to explore and see all they have to offer!"
1366,19,We had a great time. The yurt was lovely and the vibes and atmosphere of the area was awesome. So peaceful and relaxing. The host was great and we look forward to coming back.
1367,19,The yurt is a great for recharging! The hosts were wonderful and accommodating. I greatly enjoyed my stay
1368,19,"Peaceful, beautiful, wonderful!"
1369,19,"One of the most tranquil and sereneplaces I have ever been. Even though it says no AC, then breeze that comes from there is amazing, especially with all the fans. It also helps to get in the hot tub (even in the summer) for a bit. This definitely helps cool you off when you get out. The owners, dogs, chickens and the goose are all fantastic! Definitelywill come again!"
1370,19,"We stayed for a short weekend and absolutely loved it. A very quite spot in the woods with two wonderful, respectful hosts. The Yurt itself is very charming with plenty of things to occupy a curious mind. The village nearby is charming and filled with young couples with kids, it was very welcoming."
1371,19,"Where to begin, everything about here is fabulous. You are five minutes from the village of Saxapahaw, with the River, store and restaurant. Yet when you are at the yurt, it's like you are in your own little oasis. Sitting on the deck, listening to the frogs below in the pond is just magical. Our son loved the hot tub and their dogs who are so friendly.
Linda and Steve do a great job of both making you feel welcome, but also giving you your privacy. I would recommend here in a heartbeat"
1372,19,Private and quiet. Nice deck to sit on. The yurt is so unique and had everything we needed. Would definitely recommend
1373,19,"I highly recommend the yurt! Beautiful art, beautiful land, beautiful dogs. The yurt itself is dripping in character. You can really tell the hosts put their heart and soul into making it a fun, livable space. Our favorite part of staying here was just checking out the interesting decorations, books, and dvds on the shelves.

If you come in the summer like we did, be prepared to sweat a lot. After all, sleeping in a yurt is more similar to camping than it is to sleeping in a well-ventilated, air-conditioned hotel. The hosts are quite friendly and provide multiple high-powered fans which were very helpful."
1374,19,"I can’t say how amazing this stay was because words would not do it justice. My husband and I spent a weekend enjoying nature, playing games, watching DVD’s, enjoying the hot tub and having a lot of quality time. This yurt is incredible and the hosts are amazing. We absolutely loved everything about this stay. Amazing!!"
1375,19,"Linda’s yurt is an AMAZING place. The yurt was so spacious and comfy and cozy. It has everything you need. My boys and I loved the frog pond and the beautiful grounds. The hot tub and fire pit were so fun at night. Linda is an exceptional host. She is kind and helpful. We had a quiet, private, wonderful time. I hope we can return again someday!"
1376,19,Very nice place to stay if you love the country area. It's a nice place to have time away for family or take them with you.
1377,19,"The Yurt at Frog Pond Farm was an amazing, tranquil retreat nestled in the trees. The views from the deck overseeing the pond are beautiful with sightings of Cher (the Goose) taking a dip and the songs of the frogs singing at dawn. Waking up to the calming sounds of the birds singing with the morning sun. My family enjoyed walking the property and exploring the Art/Art Gallery Yurt & Poetry paths.

Linda & Steve were great hosts and available if you have any questions. Garret, Allen and Gracie were also great hosts. We definitely recommend this getaway and can't wait to come back.

Thank you Linda & Steve!"
1378,20,"Very modern and trendy feel. Right on the beach and the beach has a very private feel to it, hardly anyone on it. You do need to drive to restaurants but I love the beach town feel without it being overly touristy. Highly recommend based on the Airbnb, location and modern feel."
1379,20,WilliamIhave to say. Beach therapy was the perfect name. We will be coming back this summer for sure. We love the laid back relax vibe. And don't get me started on how amazing it was to have the beach right out the back. Thank you so much for making our trip an amazing memory!
1380,20,"An awesome family spring break location! Great host(s) with lovely touches, well stocked and SUPER clean!

The location can’t be beat — right on the beach, with a beachfront porch for coffee & mimosa mornings.

Comfortable and reasonably priced (really, we’ve stayed in the area for years — for the location, this was a steal).

Thanks so much!"
1381,20,Williams place was perfect. He was always super responsive and timely. Check in and out was a breeze. If you choose to stay here RIcks is a great place to eat! We would definitely visit again!
1382,20,Nice and peaceful
1383,20,Beach therapy is an amazing spot. Super clean and right on the beach. The unit was very quiet and exactly what the description said and what the pictures looked like. Highly recommend
1384,20,"Emily,
Thank you for the compliment, and the recommendation!"
1385,20,Staying right on the ocean was just what my soul needed. We had an amazing time even with the colder temperatures. William informed us of the work being done on the beach the day of check in but it didn’t impact the views or our ability to easily walk down to the beach until we checked out. This place is super cute & the thoughtful details definitely make it worth all the ⭐️s. We would absolutely come back and stay again!
1386,20,"Laura, we are glad you got in your Beach Therapy. Also understanding the dynamics of beach and the musts of the beach nourishment. The Beach Therapy team will be happy to host you on your next trip."
1387,20,Awesome stay. Beautiful views. Super clean and well worth the price. Thanks!
1388,20,"Bryan, you are welcome. See you again on your next trip!
-Thank you"
1389,20,This place was perfect and it covered all the bases. It was very functional and accommodating. It was very clean and was just as described by the pictures. William was very responsive. I will certainly recommend this place and will rebook the next time I’m in NTB.
1390,20,This was the perfect place for a quick romantic getaway. The balcony was wonderful and it was fun cooking while listening to the ocean. The bedroom had good cozy beach vibes. William was very accommodating and responsive!
1391,20,Loved the place! Picked a great time to be there!
1392,20,great place to stay and awesome view would definitely stay again
1393,20,"Our week stay at Beach Therapy was perfect! It was off-season so we practically had a private beach. Weather was a mixture...had a little rain, little sun, little cool, little warm. Sweet welcome waiting for us with chocolates and the makings for Mimosa's. Beautiful, peaceful. Our host, William, left restaurant suggestions, activities, etc.. Great experience...hope to visit again!"
1394,20,Great stay and a great host!
1395,20,"This place went above and beyond, its private, peaceful... loved everything about it, ice maker, coffee station had my favorite coffee, fluffy towels and robes..... I will be returning, thank you William for everything."
1396,20,"Terrific stay at Willam’s place! Right on the water, easy coordination of check in, stay and check out. Nice place, well-appointed and beachy. Proactive hosts with lots of local tips and recommendations! If you’re looking to get away during the off-season, this is a great place to do it. Would absolutely stay again! Thanks so much!"
1397,20,"Beach therapy was wonderful. One of the best air bnb’s I’ve stayed in. The place was beautiful, well cleaned, and the snacks/drinks were a nice touch. I also enjoyed the games at the home. View was beautiful, couldn’t get any close to the ocean. I would recommend this place to someone visiting
TB and I would def book again. The host was quick in communicating and the check in was a breeze."
1398,20,The space was cute and very clean! The host always responded quickly to questions and provided great detail for check in and out. A great stay overall!
1399,20,Clean house and easy check in
1400,20,William’s place was absolutely beautiful!!! The atmosphere was amazing. Everything was spotless! It was truly an amazing experience! We really enjoyed this relaxing place. We were welcomed with a bottle of champagne! Everything accessible to make meals etc! Every picture posted was just like how it looked in rare form! We’ll be back!
1401,20,"My boyfriend and I had the best weekend in Williams’ place! Really could not have asked for anything more. Loved everything about it and what was offered at the location and neighboring towns. Communication was perfect. The Wi-Fi/AC/humidifier were all easy to work and had easy instructions to follow. There was even a bottle of bubbly for our New Years, which was super nice but we did not end up drinking it.
The beach was really nice and plenty of yummy food options.
Will definitely keep this location as a repeat destination for future trips to the coast.

If this host has other properties…I would probably recommend those too!"
1402,20,"Great stay, relaxing and very enjoyable"
1403,20,"Talk about Oceanfront view!! Espectacular! The view is stunning! You’ll be able to watch the shrimp boats stroll through. The place was super cute. I love the decor throughout this cute little cozy spot. I’m definitely booking again! LOVE IT!!!!
William was an outstanding host from the very beginning.
Thanks for such a wonderful stay.
~Dora"
1404,20,"It could be better I like to surf fish the beach is right at the back door there isn’t much beach could not surf fish couldn’t even sit on the beach the ocean has just about taken over big sand bags that’s been protecting the condo
For many years, it seems like other ones in the water you would trip on them if you went out there it will have to be low tide. You would not go out there on high tide it’s up to sand bags I’m not talking Little sandbags either I’m talking about big ones so if you have kids, you can forget about it going on that part of the beach at condo you got to go down the road and you’re gonna have to pay surfcast to park when you should be able to enjoy the beach where you stay which is what I had to do. The couch in the living room that pulls out into a bed. That thing is bad to sit on. Hurt my back needs a little something else to sit on the living room to watch TV. Get rid of the Bing bag not too comfy. I’m sorry, but I will not be revisiting Beach therapy"
1405,20,"Mr. Robert,
Thank you for your feedback, and I apologize that Beach Therapy did not meet your expectations. Beach Therapy has had plenty of 5-star reviews, and I do wish that you would have taken the time to look at our pictures, listing details, and other reviews before committing to reserve Beach Therapy. In the future speak to the host before booking if you are unclear about any amenities.

The Surf: If you looked at the pictures posted in the property listing, you will see that the water is super close to the property. Also, you booked in the off season with off season pricing which, the tides are typically higher than on season.

The Sandbags: Again, as you can see in the pictures, posted for the Beach Therapy listing, that the sandbags are BIG (placed by the Army Corps of Engineers), because the surf does come up to the property line (especially in the off season)

Surfcast Parking: Beach Therapy has free parking. If the beach is on high tide/inaccessible and you decide to drive north or south to pay to park, that is your choice. There are a few spots along the drive that offer free parking also an inexpensive fishing pier/free parking for fishermen.

Seating arrangement: The bean bag has always been a big plus for families, we have had personal messages from guests asking where the team bought it. The couch is pictured as well, as it is a pull-out couch (secondary bed), and extra comforters and linens are provided to help make it a little more comfortable if an adult decides to sleep on it. Also, there is now a 4-inch mattress topper because of your review.

Happy Fishing!
The Beach Therapy Team."
1406,20,"Beach Therapy is fantastic! Exactly as shown in the listing. Clean, modern, comfortable, with so many thoughtful extras like plush bathrobes, beverages, and snacks.

The views are amazing - you literally cannot get closer to the beach. You are ON the beach lol. The ocean is right outside the balcony, and you can even feel the mist while looking out. There were plenty of nearby restaurants, shops, things to do, and obviously easy access to the beach.

Check-in was a breeze, and our host was super responsive! He returned messages within minutes, offered recommendations, gave instructions, and cared about how well our stay was. My husband and I truly loved it. We highly recommend to everyone!"
1407,20,Perfect stay! Everything was just as pictured! Ocean just steps away….every comfort we could need and great touches throughout the place. And super clean! Would definitely stay again!
1408,20,"Almost everything you need is provided. You can just pack your bags and hop in the car and point it toward North Topsail Island.
You can't get any closer to the ocean if you tried.
Plus cold mugs in the freezer!"
1409,20,Beach Therapy is a neat place & very well stocked!!😊
1410,20,"Beach therapy was wonderful!! There so many amenities like a plush bathrobe, snacks, and container top ice maker. The view was spectacular! You could almost touch the beach. We had most of our meals outside on the table. By far the best Airbnb!"
1411,20,"If you’re looking for oceanfront, look no further! This place is incredible. We were welcomed by multi-color rave led lights and immediately knew we were in for a good time. The hosts went above and beyond to add extra touches - including mimosas! It feels like you are literally sitting over the ocean when you’re on the balcony. Card games and a big, fluffy bean bag chair make this place even more special. Oh, and the bed is super soft and comfortable! This AirBnB is true beach therapy indeed."
1412,20,"This is a great place to stay if you’re looking for something right on the beach! Amazing views from your balcony and just a few steps away from the beach. Being on the first floor was an added bonus making bring in luggage and beach supplies very easy. There was a very comfortable bed in the bedroom. Plenty of spare pillows and a comfy couch too. Fun lights all over the condo and several modern decorations were a nice touch. William even left us some snacks and small goodies too! There are several fun card games in the living room along with a smart tv and great speakers. The tv has streaming accounts that are already signed into for guests. In the bathroom there were a couple of robes, plenty of soft towels, make up remover and cotton rounds, face wash, and a dispenser with body wash, shampoo, and conditioner in the shower. All of this made for a wonderful stay! We can’t wait to come back!"
1413,20,"This was an awesome stay, top notch communication. I will be returning. thank you for your service"
1414,20,"Ronnie,
Happy you enjoyed Beach Therapy. Thank you for leaving the place super clean."
1415,20,"Amazing place! Perfect location right on the beach, and parking was just a few steps away. Exactly as advertised. Very clean and comfortable. It was also very quiet, which you might not get in other condo facilities. Everyone was friendly and respectful. Highly recommend!"
1416,20,Thank you for the kind response and recommendation!
1417,20,This was the perfect beach getaway for my husband and me. The place is immaculate and beautiful. I loved the balcony. The host is great and he had so many extras to welcome us. You really cannot get any closer to the Ocean. I would definitely come back!
1418,20,I was in town for a golf weekend. The check in process was smooth the home was very well appointed and clean and the location is absolutely amazing. I recommend this host to anybody coming to the area.
1419,20,"Will,

I appreciate your recommendation; Beach Therapy will gladly host you again for your next golf outing."
1420,20,"Beach Therapy was just what we needed! They have the place so beautifully decorated, and well stocked with everything you could ever possibly need in a beach get away. The mimosa ingredients and chocolates were an extra special little touch. Even when tide was high, the beach could be enjoyed on the deck. We took several walks on the beach and found some sea glass and shark teeth. Already looking forward to our next stay at Beach Therapy!"
1421,20,"The perfect stay! This condo is dreamy with its beach front location and bright and airy decoration. The place was spotless upon check-in and was well equipped with everything from coffee to quality linens and towels . No old, scratchy towels here. William made us feel so welcome ! I will certainly be staying here again. It was perfect for a long weekend at the beach !"
1422,21,Very unique place with a great host!
1423,21,"Such a cool place to stay! I was especially excited about the hammock, afternoons lazing there were so relaxing. Trent was very responsive to messages and came out to help us out ASAP when we asked."
1424,21,"We enjoyed our stay at Lucy Lu's! Loved the firepit, hammock, and serene setting."
1425,21,The only thing that could have made my stay better was if the antenna would have picked up at least 1 channel. I eventually went to the store and bought a movie to watch
1426,21,Came for my sister’s 30th birthday. Everything was as described. Great location and a lovely experience. If you are a Lord of the Rings fan you will love it. Nice touch having firewood for sale. Would like to come stay in one of the treehouses next time.
1427,21,Great experience. I must visit for Lord of the Rings fans! My 13 year old loved it. Wonderful local coffee shop a couples miles away n downtown Landis.
1428,21,Exactly like the post! Loved it here.
1429,21,"We had a great time, Lucy Lu's was clean, bed comfortable, and we had all the basics. Host Trent was responsive and helpful. Only negative was the shower, which had very low flow. For a short stay it wasn't such a big deal as to ruin our trip. We would return and would recommend."
1430,21,"Our stay at Lucy Lu’s was cozy and unique. It was the perfect getaway to relax and step away from the bustle of everyday life. Being Lord of the Rings fans, we were very excited to stay in a hobbit hole. Nestled in the ground and surrounded by the trees and other treehouses, it felt secluded and homey. Our goal was to step away and enjoy quiet time together. We didn’t mind the lack of wifi or limited tv channels because it really helped us disconnect and enjoy our surroundings more. Knowing the kitchen was limited to a microwave and mini fridge, we just packed meal prep containers that we could heat up in the microwave. That worked great and prevented us from needing to leave or worry about a lot of cleanup. It was a little chilly inside when we first arrived but the heaters inside worked pretty well after we got them going. We did pack an extra blanket based on other reviews, but they had an extra one ready for us on the bed.
Our whole experience was pretty cozy and homey."
1431,21,Great place to stay ..exactly like the photos ...great overall experience
1432,21,"Very nice place for a short getaway! Very clean space! The shower head could be upgraded to give more pressure! Other than that which is not a big deal at all, the place was very comfortable and cozy!"
1433,21,Fun times and we will be back
1434,21,We had a lovely stay. My kids so enjoyed it especially the jumping balloon. Thanks again!
1435,21,This was a fun getaway. We will love to come back with family & friends!!!
1436,21,Fantastic stay and Trent was a great host!!
1437,21,"Fantastic stay!! Awesome hobbit hole that was super cozy. It wasn't clear by the description that there was no kitchen, just a microwave and mini fridge so maybe that needs to be more explicitly stated. Other than that, we enjoyed ourselves immensely. Great walking space, had fun by the fire. Would recommend."
1438,21,Nice little getaway
1439,21,Awesome place and I have already booked another trip for the kids!
1440,21,We had a wonderful time and will be back!
1441,21,"Fun, beautiful, and one-of-a-kind place!"
1442,21,We had a magnificent stay for our mini honeymoon! We stayed in Lucy Lu’s Hobbit House. The location was easier to find than what we thought but directions were slightly confusing with us arriving at night haha. But we found it and got settled in! It was quiet with the exception of our neighbors laughing and having a good time (we enjoyed it). I love that their kids are involved and benefit from helping with each place. Other guests we encountered in passing were so kind and friendly! We will be back for sure!
1443,21,The Hobbit house was very warm and welcoming. We started a fire even in the rain and the tree for Christmas was still up. It was magical for New years and we really enjoyed ourselves. We live close by and we will be back!
1444,21,"Super fun and cozy stay!

We had a blast and loved the area. Very cute and well done.

The owner was super responsive and kind and made the stay enjoyable"
1445,21,we love staying at Cherry Treesort! can't wait to try out one of the treehouses next! very peaceful and allows you to enjoy the people you come with!
1446,21,Be aware there is only a mini fridge and microwave. Limited counter space and glass ware.
1447,21,"Father’s Day gift to avid LOTR fan. We had to cancel due to hurricane / Trent was accommodating. We rebooked for December (near the Polar Express and per reviews I read he had Christmas lights and trees).
-The Christmas lights on Lucy Lu didn’t work
-The weather was a low of 25, high of 55. We froze. The mini split couldn't keep up, would go into defrost mode often (we had it set to 75); the space heater provided broke and sent sparks flying. Trent did bring new heater & gave advice on where to keep the thermostat. But so cold. Saved only by our socks and many blankets *we brought*
-shower curtain was pink from mold
-couch had body fluids and stains on every cushion
-the pull out couch was loud and uncomfortable for my kids
-the linens provided only included a fitted sheet for the pullout & 3 towels for 4 guests. Saved by the 5 blankets we brought. He did bring more towels.
-our socks were filthy from the floors
-no LOTR decor at all; just gnomes
-exposed nails
-broken clock
-smell"
1448,21,"This guest was a high maintenance disaster from the first time she canceled her reservation last minute due to rain. Per rules, we did not have to reschedule her but we did.

There are a few inaccuracies about her review so I will address them:

The heat works fine in the unit, she had the thermostat right next to the unit and that was not allowing the unit to fully heat. She asked for another heater and we complied immediately.

The floors are mopped each stay with swiffer wet wipes. Im guessing the dirt on your socks is from the debris you brought in. Our cleaning crew is top notch and your review does not align with other guests.

The shower curtains are rotated on a bi weekly schedule. We always have fresh shower liners.

The couch is the last issue I will address. This is a rental unit! It gets used a lot by guests. Saying there are bodily fluids on the couch is simply an immature response and a bold face lie. There might be a stain from a spilt drink or kids, but bodily fluids is a bit dramatic!

I dont usually respond to reviews but when a guest comes in and never complains to us……. And then slams us on a review. I felt it needed to be addressed!"
1449,21,Loved my stay. A great way to start my birthday. Will definately come back.
1450,21,We absolutely loved our stay. Will probably stay again!
1451,21,Really cool spot with great options and not far off the beaten path
1452,21,This is exactly the kind of camping I want to do. We have been twice our first day was at Chicos hideaway and this year we did the hobbit house. We love it here and will keep coming back as a family for years to come. The only thing I would suggest for gas is to bring a couple of blankets as it does get chilly at night and with all of our family we did not have enough blankets to go round.
1453,21,Cute place!
1454,21,"Best adventure ever!!
if you are a curious soul that lives to wander and explore, then staying here is a no brainier. The atmosphere is so relaxing that you never want to leave.
I am so excited to book another stay here in the future!"
1455,21,The pictures do not do this amazing property justice. The attention to detail was impressive. The long awaited stay was a gift for my husband’s 50th birthday earlier in the year. He is a huge Tolkien fan. We enjoyed our evening by the fire enjoying some of his works. Hope to return soon!
1456,21,"Trent is super easy to work with. He's quick with his communication, open and honest. The place looks lovely and perfectly located right outside of Charlotte."
1457,21,Such a fun location. Really enjoyed our stay.
1458,21,Excellent stay. A very unique place with a great firepit.
1459,21,"This was such a gem! I wanted to bring in my 40th in a unique style and this was definitely it. The round door and walls makes this Hobbit Hole underground stay even better! I felt like this was a small movie set and I was the gnome in it. Can’t wait to stay at one of the other tree houses here as well. Main bed was very comfortable, pull out sofa is more for kids. They also had a trampoline on the property for the kids, to keep them occupied. Met Trent and his son while they were maintaining a property. Love his kids contribution to the property. What made this even better, it’s only an hour away from our home. Definitely will be back!"
1460,21,"What a fun visit to Lucy Lu's hobbit house! My grandson and I made our second visit to Cherry Treesort and had a great time. The house was clean, comfortable, and accurate in its description. I found the bed to be super comfy, and the seating in the living area too. We enjoyed a cozy fire in the fire pit. Trent is a wonderful, attentive host."
1461,21,"Loved the Hobbit house!
Surprised my husband for our Anniversary.. i searched for days for treehouses and came across Treesort. Seen the Hobbit house and had to book it. It was so clean and so cozy.
Bed and pillows were also very comfortable! We will be back in a few weeks to stay in a treehouse."
1462,21,Great stay! Each unit is perfectly spaced out so it still feels private.
1463,21,"We had a wonderful stay at the Treesort! I hope we can come back again soon!
It wasn’t a problem for us, but just a heads up for others- there’s no wifi. There is a Blu-ray player, so maybe pack a favorite or plan swing by a Redbox close by for a rainy night in."
1464,21,"Romantic, quiet and nice location"
1465,21,This place was so amazing. The perfect place for LOTR fans. Clearly a ton of work went into this. It is tucked away with a lot of privacy which we also appreciated.
1466,21,Great place! Peaceful area! Can’t wait to go back!
1467,21,Great place to reconnect
1468,21,"The Hobbit Hole is exactly as in the ad. Has all amenities, etc. One of my best friends is getting married and we booked it for a part of his bachelor weekend to end the weekend. Cooked by the camp fire, listened to music, etc. There are two outlets so if you’re trying to plug in a speaker or charge your phones outside you should bring an extension cable."
1469,21,Loved every minute at our hobbit houses! We rented both for my son’s ninth birthday and had his cousins join. We told ghost stories by the fire the boys made new friends while exploring (staying the tree houses) and the houses themselves are just so much fun! We will be back for sure!!
1470,21,"A whimsical escape! The little house was super darling and delightful. We thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere.

Currently Lucy Lu's is ideal for a couple, and I wouldn't recommend any more than that.

We'd love to try a treehouse next time.

Many Thanks."
1471,21,Wonderful place to stay!
1472,21,"Another great visit. We're always happy with places, regardless of whether it's a treehouse or hobbit house."
1473,21,"This was the PERFECT little getaway! I wish I would have booked the hobbit house for two nights instead of one.
If you are ever in the area, I HIGHLY recommend staying here instead of a hotel. So cute, cozy, and secluded.
We will be back for a treehouse stay next time.

Also Trent was super easy to deal with &&& he’s watching over the area himself, making sure everything is okay and no one is there that shouldn’t be. 💙"
1474,21,Amazing and unique place to stay! Can’t wait to try the treehouses!
1475,21,We absolutely loved staying here. We’ve stayed in one of the treehouses before and my son has been begging to stay in a hobbit hole. It was extremely clean and a lovely place to rest. We will be back!
1476,21,This place is such a rare gem and we’ll definitely be back again.
1477,21,Surprised my husband for our 24th anniversary. He loves the Lord of the Rings so Lucy Lu’s Hobbit house was perfect and did not disappoint. The place was very clean and very cozy and quiet for our stay. Trent was easy to communicate with if needed. We enjoyed the design of our place as well as seeing the other cool treehouses in the treesort♥️ We hope to come back with our teenage boys so we can enjoy the experience as a family.
1478,21,"Wonderful stay that was peaceful and reviving. I didn’t take advantage of the firewood or s’mores given the 90 degree temps, but the presence of the availability of the small touch was nice. Overall, a great stay ."
1479,21,"The hobbit house was beautiful, and we enjoyed exploring the paths in the woods. My 5-year asked if we could “make this our home”. 🤣 I feel we will definitely come back to t he Cherry Treesort. I also highly recommend the China Grove Family House restaurant for great home cooking!"
1480,21,"This was our second stay at the treesort, first in a Hobbit home. As always, Trent was very hospitable and we had everything we needed for our stay. as short as our stay was, it was perfect."
1481,21,"Very clean place, easy in and out."
1482,21,"This is an amazing experience for a family!!! We highly recommend this as a get away or stop- over. It’s reasonably priced and an experience you won’t forget!!
The staff is very accommodating and pleasant."
1483,21,"My friend and I stayed at one of the treehouses a few weeks ago and decided to try out one of the Hobbit Houses and boy, we weren't disappointed! From the ambient lighting, to the comfortable furniture, to the overall beautiful exterior and interior, we very much enjoyed our second stay at the Cherry Treesort and will definitely be back for a third time soon!"
1484,21,What a fantastic and unique experience. Great for a family of 4. We bought 10 logs a dollar a log of brilliant fire wood. Our family loved every part of this hobbit house!
1485,21,"A great place , so quite. I will be returning."
1486,21,Very cute and cozy; loved wandering around the property and seeing all of the other treehouses. Lots of work went into creating this little community.
1487,21,"This hobbit hole is an absolute must! Beautiful, clean, and an experience in itself!"
1488,21,Great unique place to stay on our way south.
1489,21,"Cute little place for some much needed downtime! Clean, tidy, and well organized for a family get away. We stopped in and stayed in the Hobbit House for just one night from FL in between our sons crazy race schedule. We will be back for a longer stay next time in a treehouse."
1490,21,After a very long drive we decided to stop and rest. Hobbit home was a great choice! We were able to unwind and relax. Perfect!
1491,21,"Very nice and quiet place to get away from the noisy city life. The host had paper plates, bowls and eating utensils. We weren’t sure so we had brought our own. The firewood is only $1.00 per log. It was nice that we didn’t have to bring our own for the firepit. We will definitely be back!"
1492,21,"We loved this cute little Hobbit House. We felt like we were in Bilbos house in Lord of the Rings. The bed was comfy, the AC was nice, and the bathroom was nice. Note - there is not an oven. Just a microwave and mini fridge. But the mirror was a nice addition. We loved it and sat out by the fire all night. We will be back!"
1493,21,Lucy Lu’s is a must visit!
1494,21,Awesome
1495,21,Great experience at the hobbit house! It was so charming. We especially enjoyed the fire pit and hammock. The bedding was comfortable and the house spacious enough for three of us (parents and teenager). Trent was very communicative and responded very quickly to any questions or concerns we had. We'll be back! We're eager to try one of the treehouses.
1496,21,You’ll enjoy it
1497,21,This was an adorable place! If you’re looking for a break from electronics and enjoy sitting/cooking by a fire this place is for you!
1498,21,Great experience!
1499,21,"Overall it was a great experience! The hobbit hole was perfect. If you’re hoping for a quiet weekend away, just double check that there isn’t a birthday party scheduled the same time. I love that all those kids had a blast, but as an exhausted mom I booked this weekend to get away from kids, lol."
1500,21,We had an amazing time! It can get a bit chilly inside the room but it was lovely. It feels private and having the fire pit is a great feature.
1501,21,"Very easy check in nice place, will come back"
1502,21,Very amazing place. Nice and cozy. Nice place to roast marshmallows by the fire!
1503,21,"Such a cooᖘ place! If you’re looking to get away from city life and take it easy and go off the grid for a while, this is the place! We had such a fun time at cherry treesort at one of the hobbit houses! My kids absolutely loved exploring the grounds and we had a great time visiting some of the other local attractions (Lazy 5 Ranch). Would highly recommend!"
1504,21,"Pristine cleanliness in the unit and the grounds were awesome. Definitely worth the price for the experience. My kids thought it was amazing and they felt like they were hobbits. We brought our own DVD of LOTR and watched that going to bed at night. The main bed was SUPER comfy and even the pull out wasn't bad. The directions seemed lengthy at first but were straightforward and made perfect sense when pulling in. We loved it, we would definitely recommend not only this unit but the whole Cherry Treesort!"
1505,21,Great!
1506,21,Another great getaway!
1507,21,Great place! Definitely be coming back!
1508,21,Cool place. We had a great experience!
1509,21,"Better than expected! My kids loved it, too! They especially loved walking up to “Nick’s Wood Shack” and paying for logs for the fire. Will be back."
1510,21,We love it here!
1511,21,Perfect little Hobbit hole. We loved it!
1512,21,Unique and charming!
1513,21,Serene place and the perfect getaway.
1514,21,Expect unique accommodations with there individual quirks. All the more fun.
1515,21,"Welcome to middle earth! A cute Hobbit Hole with round doors, windows, and interior doorways.
The fire pit is private just for your Hobbit Hole and very generously sized. It has nice Adirondack chairs, which saves you from the bother of bringing your own chairs.
This is something a Tolkien fan would expect to have to go to New Zealand to stay in.
Well done!"
1516,21,Such a fun spot! Even better than we expected. Hope to stay in the Hobbit hole again!
1517,21,"Really enjoyed our stay in Lucy Lu's ""hobbit house!"""
1518,21,"Wonderful tranquil yet well-equipped and very clean location, convenient for Mooresville, yet felt away from the hustle and bustle as I watched the fire burn, hearing only the sound of children playing around the nearby tree houses. Great place, great host."
1519,21,Everything was perfect. Can’t wait to be back! Even better in person!
1520,21,Wonderful Airbnb! Such a hidden Gem!
1521,21,"Despite the weather, it was a great time. Kids loved it!"
1522,21,Pretty cool place!!
1523,21,"First off Lucy Lu's hobbit house is absolutely breathtaking and clean.. but for what we wanted to do this was not the place for us.

I originally missed the no wifi which wasnt a big deal.. but its basically dvd only so if you need background noise bring dvds. (We were close enough to home to run back and get dvds)
It was hard to keep warm but the space heater helped out alot. (When we went back home we had to grab warmer clothes)
The hammock broke on us and when i said something i was told the straps were ""unbreakable"" .. so i sent a photo of the ""unbreakable"" strap. Thank God we werent seriously hurt.

Now, we know what were getting into, i would love to come back, plan accordingly and hope for a different and better experience."
1524,21,"I usually don’t respond to reviews but I need to clear something up. The TV worked just fine, they had it on the wrong input. As far as the straps on the hammock go, I was simply telling them when I bought them that is what was said on the box. They seem to be upset about something I cannot control. Next time read the instructions on the Wi-Fi and you might not be so upset."
1525,21,"Adorable, perfect, creative little place! Everything was super clean and cozy. We felt at home with amenities and a nice fire. Kids enjoyed exploring the property, and the firewood and s’mores were much appreciated ☺️"
1526,21,Great - quiet and clean little get away !
1527,21,I’ve stayed on this property once before when traveling with some friends and it was great then and even better now. The hobbit homes made my little nerdy heart so full and Trent was very responsive when we had questions. There’s firewood to buy on property and so toasty fire side chats were the relaxing time we needed. I absolutely will be coming back
1528,21,Great house
1529,22,The place is in a great location for food and fun! Perfect for two people!
1530,22,Location was great and the house is perfect for 2 people and includes every detail as described.
1531,22,"Fantastic! You'll fall in love with this home, great location to the beach and lake. Joe and Michelle also provided excellent recommendations for restaurants and local activities."
1532,22,Great place for a small getaway! It was very clean. Close to everything…
1533,22,"This was our second time staying at the little blue cottage. It was very clean, has a great location, and we were very happy with our stay."
1534,22,"What a great find! The house is exactly as pictured and perfect for two people. Everything to do is within a very short walking distance, we didn’t use our car at all the weekend that we stayed. The house is beautifully, decorated and very clean. The guidebook that they created was perfect and very helpful as this was our first time to Carolina Beach. We would definitely stay here again for another quick getaway to the beach."
1535,22,This place was a great little spot. In walking distance to shops/restaurants/etc. but it didn’t feel like we were on a main strip with extra hustle and bustle. It was quiet and so close to the beach! We appreciated the list of recommendations as we had never been to the area. Perfect spot for a couple to get away for a couple of days.
1536,22,Greatly enjoyed our stay! Communication was great while not overbearing!
1537,22,Had a great stay at the blue cottage! Very very peaceful and cozy. Just what we needed for a little getaway. Great location close to the beach and easy to walk over the Hang Ten Grill to grab some food and watch the sunset. Water had a very strong sulfur smell-to no fault of the host but something to keep in mind to be aware of. Was perfect for a mid-March stay but can see cottage getting hot in the summer. The hosts were super kind to leave multiple fans for our use! Great hosts and would absolutely stay here again!
1538,22,beautiful and quaint home
1539,22,"Joe and Michelle's AirBNB was a comfortable stay. The cottage is quaint and updated. It is maintained well and very clean when we arrived. It had all the amenities we needed for our stay. It is convienently located: it is about 10 minutes from Fort Fisher and approximately 25 minutes from Wilmington. We had a minor issue with the wifi. We experienced slow speeds and a few random disconnections. Overall, the wifi handled streaming platforms with only occasional buffering. The owners were very prompt when responding with troubleshooting tips when we informed them of the issue. I'd recommend this stay to anyone looking to stay at the beach and wanting to explore Wilmington or Southport area. 🙂"
1540,22,The little blue cottage was perfect! It was super clean and comfortable and had everything we needed. The location was great! Just a short walk to the beach! We enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay there again.
1541,22,Cute little cottage perfect for 2 people! Easy walk to the public access for the beach. Nice community pond across the street with walking path around it too.
1542,22,"So many good things about this cottage.
The kitchen has much of what you’d need plus more. Coffee, creamers and sugar, popcorn and trail bars… even dog bones for your pup.
The bed is really comfortable. Temperature controls work really well. We loved sitting on the porch & just relaxing

Proximity to the beach, boardwalk and restaurants was great.
Our only issue was the sulphur odor from the hot water. It only lasted a short time in the morning but it was noticeable. When I texted Joe, he was very responsive and even asked if he could make arrangements to move us. I do believe he has worked really hard on the property and will do whatever he can should the issue come up again."
1543,22,We had a wonderful time and hope to be back again soon!
1544,22,"Very cozy one bedroom cottage with peaceful surroundings. Walking distance to beach, shops and many Restaurants. We enjoyed our stay will book again! Thank you!"
1545,22,We loved our stay at the cottage! It’s in a great location (short walk from beach) and close to all restaurants. We will be back!
1546,22,Cute little cottage! It’s such a homey place.
1547,22,"Great location only a few blocks from the beach, restaurants, and entertainment. The cottage was spotless and the check-in process was a breeze! Not to mention the hosts are very responsive! Would definitely book again!"
1548,22,Joe & Michelle's place was a very nice place and very close to the beach! I would recommend this place for a couple that is trying to get away for the weekend! Weather was great and we had an amazing time visiting.
1549,22,"Always great to stay in the little blue cottage. The place and location are great! Love that we can walk to dinner and then to the park afterwards! This time it was lit up for Christmas (already)!!
Thanks for making to so easy to book, check in & out!!"
1550,22,"The cabin was amazing! The location could not have been better and it had everything we needed. Even though the weather wasn’t the best while I was there, I could not have enjoyed my stay more! Took full advantage of the park across the street and the super close beach access. The kitchen had everything I needed to cook a few meals and Joe & Michelle’s suggestion were super helpful. I am so looking forward to visiting again!!!"
1551,22,"The cottage was nice and clean. Everything was as expected. The location is great--near the beach.
We would stay again."
1552,22,"Great location, great little house!"
1553,22,"An excellent little cottage with in walking distance from everything! We didn’t rent a car and didn’t need one, this place was great. Joe and Michelle were excellent hosts and we will definitely be back!"
1554,22,Great location and very clean.
1555,22,"The Little Blue Cottage is cute and within close walking distance to public access to the beach, and restaurants. The beach is lovely and quiet (Mid-October stay). Across from the cottage is a very nice park to enjoy. Also close to Wilmington restaurants and River Walk."
1556,22,"This was our second year staying at the Little Blue Cottage. It was just as wonderful as last year, and we hope to make the cottages a yearly tradition. Joe and Michelle make everything easy, always respond to any questions quickly, and the little extras they have are so thoughtful. The house is so cozy, so clean- and the bed is so comfy…it all makes the trip seem like home away from home."
1557,22,"We absolutely LOVE the Little Blue Cottage! It was perfect for our quick getaway to the beach.The house itself is adorable, location was great, we could walk to the beach, the boardwalk, shops, and there's a lovely park right across the road. Having the little incidentals stocked - like coffee/creamer/sugar and toiletries was great too. Check in was simple and the hosts were friendly and communicative from initial reservation to check out. We really enjoyed our stay!"
1558,22,"Second time staying at this property and still enjoy location (close to great restaurants, beach and lake park), cleanliness and friendly neighbors."
1559,22,"Great location. Close to the public beach access point that wasnt crowded at all. Quiet neighborhood, great front porch with rocking chairs and mood lighting to enjoy the evenings. Cottage stayed cool and cozy for one person! Awesome mattress and pillows, the best I've had for a long time at an airbnb. loved the privacy shades as well. Bit of a foul smell coming from all sink drains and faucets. I often run into this in beach homes. Nothing that would deter me from coming back. Two spots were available for parking. Felt very safe in the area being alone. Will definitely be back."
1560,22,Great location! Perfect little cottage for our weekend away to unwind.
1561,22,"The blue cottage is the perfect beach find! The house is in a quiet neighborhood, easy access to the beach, grocery and shops. I enjoyed walking/running the streets, watching the night sky and spending the day at the beach. it's a great house if you are staying alone or as a couple."
1562,22,Cute spot super close to the beach! Loved the porch and overall vibe and will definitely recommend staying here
1563,22,"We absolutely LOVED our stay at the blue cottage! My husband and I now annually come to CB and this year it was ten times better staying here. We brought our pups who loved the space and loved how close we were to both the boardwalk and the beach. It was in the perfect spot and was a perfect size for the four of us. Truly couldn’t complain about anything, everything was clean and accurately described. We hope we get to stay here every year!"
1564,22,"We had a great time staying at the Blue Cottage.
Quick easy check-in, the digital door lock was very simple.
We were within walking distance to the beach, the boardwalk and restaurants. We walked everywhere, except for the day we took the ferry to Southport, the ferry port was also a quick drive along the coast.

The Blue Cottage was clean, the bed was very comfortable. The pillows were great, in fact we ordered the same ones when we got home. We loved the rockers and lighting on the front porch!"
1565,22,"Loved my stay at the little blue cottage! It was great to get to bring my dogs and the cleanliness and location was perfect. I especially love the lights on the porch, it added just the right amount of magic to make my stay perfect! The hosts are very responsive and helpful if needed!"
1566,22,"Great little spot, so close to the beach! We had a lovely stay."
1567,22,What a perfect little cottage! It was plenty of room for my husband and I. The location is so close to the beach access and to so many restaurants and the boardwalk. The cottage is very clean and comfortable. The neighborhood is very quiet in the evenings. We were pleased with our choice. We had a wonderful little vacation in Carolina Beach.
1568,22,We had a great time.
1569,22,Great location to the beach and a very clean and comfy place. Nice and quiet part of town. Lots of little touches to the place that made it stand out compared to many other AirBnBs we have stayed at. Would definitely stay here again.
1570,22,Very nice little place right by the beach.
1571,22,"Quaint cozy cottage, but spacious enough we didn't feel cramped. Great location, walked to beach, boardwalk, restaurants and off course ice cream. Easy check-in (host has great process for check-in code makes it so simple to remember). Enjoyed the rockers on the porch in the evening and easy access to everything in/around Carolina Beach. Cleanliness, communication all an A+."
1572,22,"This cottage is wonderful! I booked it last minute and Joe & Michelle were great. Communication is really good, cottage is cute and tidy. Location is great. Will definitely stay here again."
1573,22,It’s a perfect bungalow for you and your pup! We had a great time.
1574,22,"My husband and I stayed at the Little Blue Cottage for a few days and really enjoyed our time there! The house is comfortable and clean, and the location is perfect. I recommend that your stay include Thursday so you can take advantage of the short walk to listen to music and see fireworks at the boardwalk. We really appreciated the smart lock for when we went to the beach. We didn't have the stress of keeping up with a key. We also appreciated that the bed slept so well. We enjoyed our short vacation and plan to visit again!"
1575,22,Very clean and lovely!
1576,22,"Everything about this cottage is perfect! It is super clean and we had everything we needed. Communication was awesome. We really appreciated being able to bring our two small dogs. The location is quiet but so close to the beach, and the people of Wilmington and Carolina Beach are so friendly. Healthy fresh food options all close by. We will be back next time we come for a beach get away."
1577,22,"Great location, you can walk about to anything. Good for a quick getaway!"
1578,22,The check-in process was simple and effortless. The cottage is walking distance from everything! The only time we used the car was the first day to get groceries. Being able to take the dog was a plus. They had dog bowls readily available and even treats. Will definitely be booking here again!!
1579,22,"Great location. Quiet street. Walking distance to bars, restaurants and beach."
1580,22,Great location and great stay! Highly recommend!
1581,22,Great stay very nice and also clean. In a great location

1583,22,Super cute and clean place close to the beach!
1584,22,Another great stay with Joe and Michelle! We have stayed at the Green Cottage multiple times and decided to give the Blue Cottage a try! We loved it just as much! Always clean and a wonderful location! Joe and Michelle’s cottages will always be our go to stays in CB!

1588,22,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay in the Cottage for a long Memorial Day weekend! We also enjoyed our stay with our dog, Jackson. The location of the cottage is ideal -- we were able to walk to many restaurants (and walk off calories), the boardwalk, and the beach. Although it was close to everything - including the Farmer's Market on Saturday -- it was very quiet. The Cottage came with everything you might need - including some extras. The bed might have been the most comfortable I've slept in -- including the Westin's Heavenly Bed ;). I hope to be able to make it back soon!"
1589,22,"Perfect beach getaway spot for 2+ our pup! So close to the beach and fun restaurants,coffee shop,bars & more!"
1590,22,"Great spot near the beach! A 0.2 mile walk to the beach, actually so close. The bed was comfortable and the cottagw was super cozy. We spent a lot of time on the rocking chair front porch with our pup. Would stay again!!"
1591,22,This little blue cottage is perfect in every way!
1592,22,"Very clean place, great location- close to the beach and plenty to do within walking distance!"
1593,22,The little blue cottage is a great place to stay. Very spacious for a one bedroom. I loved how close to the beach it is. I'll definitely be booking again!
1594,22,The cottage was perfect. Close to everything. First class job! I hope to stay there again.
1595,22,Great place to stay however not ideal for quick 1 night stay due to check out time and price.
1596,22,"What a wonderful beach spot! This home was exactly what we needed-clean, great location, updated and tidy. We were there for a quick beach getaway and the location was within walking distance to everything, easy to find and very nice inside. The bed was comfy, there was all of the dishes/linens/etc that we needed. I hope we’re able to come back and stay again soon!"
1597,22,"This stay was perfect for just the two of us. It was beautiful, clean and modern. Being walking distance from the beach was amazing. We will be back in the future!"
1598,22,"would love to come back and stay here again! it was so close to everything. the beach was right around the corner, and the restaurants were wonderful. love love love 💙"
1599,22,"Little blue cottage is a wonderful cozy spot- clean, has all the essentials, great location. Joe and Michelle are wonderful hosts."
1600,22,"Such a convenient location! Was a great area for our pup, just a short walk to the park and the beach."
1601,22,Property exceed expectations. Joe & Michelle we very responsive when we had a little issue with the toilet. We would definitely return :-)
1602,22,"The house and the location are simply perfect. Walking distance from the beach, boardwalk, restaurants, coffee shops and more. The house was clean and cozy, check in and check out were smooth, not one complaint, recommend to anyone visiting the area"
1603,22,"Great location! Super clean, short walk to the beach! My pup loved sitting on the porch and loved the park right down the street! Will definitely be coming back!"
1604,22,"This little house is charming, spotless, and in a great location. It’s close to the beach, boardwalk, and everything you need, and the area was perfectly quiet and peaceful at night. Highly recommend!"

1606,22,Awesome place!
1607,22,"Great location, property is just as you see, clean, easy check in, we enjoyed our stay."
1608,22,"Perfect couples getaway location ! Loved the space, and the beach access was great."
1609,22,"My husband and I enjoyed Joe & Michelle's little cottage. We arrived a little early and Michelle was nice enough to allow us to enter the place early. The cottage is across the great from a lake with a walking travel and small play area. Looks like you can rent paddle boats in season. The place was very clean and small details were very nice to have( sponge, dish soap, coffee, popcorn, oatmeal, some bottle waters were just a few.) The king bed was comfy. It is a short walk to the beach but we weren't able to get on the beach due to them replenishing the sand, so we drove down to Kure beach and was able to sit and relax on that beach. We also got take out from the grill that is two doors down. They had the best homemade chips. If we are in the area again I wouldn't hesitate to rent again. Thank you.
Pam"
1610,22,"The cottage is located just blocks away from the beach, the boardwalk, and lots of great restaurants, yet it’s just far enough tucked away to be quiet and peaceful. Great property with really comfortable mattress and a well-stocked kitchen. It’s a perfect Carolina Beach getaway spot!"
1611,22,"we have stayed here twice now, and it's my favorite spot by the beach! close to everything you need, clean, cute, cozy, and all around perfect!!! most definitely recommend and we will probably stay again soon!"
1612,22,"Such a great location! Walking distance from the beach, the boardwalk, and only a five minute drive to Publix.

The home was very comfortable for me, my wife, and two pups. There is a nice park across the street that we used to walk our dogs in the mornings.

We were celebrating a baby moon for our baby coming soon, and I would not hesitate to come back once he is born!"
1613,22,"There’s lots of things to do & places to eat and such as well, the beach is very close & there’s also a greenway around the lake that you can walk. My boyfriend and I rode long boards on it and it was great. The actual cottage itself is absolutely amazing and we loved it from the moment we walked in to the moment we left! 10/10 I have nothing to complain about and I would recommend this to just about anyone!"
1614,22,"We found Carolina Beach and Kure Beach to be a great place for our vacation. We traveled with our 6-year old son, and the Little Blue Cottage was a great home base for our time in Carolina Beach. (At night, our son ""camped"" in his sleeping bag on the couch.)

The cottage is clean and comfortable, and it had everything we needed (i.e., a large bed and sufficiently equipped kitchen). Its location is superb -- we could walk to the beach, and it's easy to drive anywhere in Carolina Beach or Kure Beach. In addition to the beach, several places to eat are within walking distance from the cottage -- and we enjoyed everywhere we visited. The North Carolina Aquarium (about 10 minutes south of the cottage) and the Children's Museum in Wilmington were both a hit with our son.

We visited in March, so a few places were not yet open for the season, but what we found was great!

The Little Blue Cottage is a great place for a relaxing beach vacation. We would happily stay again!!"
1615,22,Staying at the little blue cottage was a great experience! It made our stay even that more memorable! Joe and Michelle were very responsive any time we had any questions. What a great place!
1616,22,Such a great stay. The location was perfect. There are all sorts of activities within walking distance. And the house was a perfect place to relax. Exactly enough space for my short beach stay. I will be looking to stay here again the next time I'm in Carolina Beach.
1617,22,"This little spot was about as perfect as it gets! Excellent location (two blocks from the beach and across the street from a little lake with a 3/4 mile path), extremely comfortable bed, LEGITIMATELY dog friendly (doggie bags out back, little pup treats on the counter, dog bowls available, easy clean floors, etc), and amazing price!!!! The grill right next door had great food, neighborhood was safe, quiet and well-lite. Secure doors and windows. We will DEFF be back!!!!"
1618,22,This stay was great! Walking distance to all restaurants and most importantly the beach! Will definitely come back!!
1619,22,Excellent stay at immaculately clean private cottage in pleasant residential neighborhood (but also extremely short walk to restaurants) and very short walk to beach and about one minute walk to lovely lake side trail walk. Mattress so comfortable! All of the cottage seems newly renovated. Kitchen had everything we needed and even snacks coffee etc. we didn’t expect. Nice rocking chairs on private front porch. Private very convenient parking immediately in front of cottage. Not disturbed by noise of any kind. Double blinds in bedroom for light control. Cottage is about two hours from our son’s house so we definitely hope to return. Highly recommend!!
1620,22,Such a cute place to stay! It was so close to the beach and places to eat! We absolutely loved sitting on the front porch in the rocking chairs and having such a cute place to come back to!
1621,22,Great little spot close to beach
1622,22,We really enjoyed our stay. Such a cute little house that was just perfect for what we needed. Beautifully decorated and so clean. All our needs were taken care of. We will definitely come back again!
1623,22,"This was the perfect beach getaway for us for a few days. We were amazed by the thoughtful touches that took “sparkling clean” to the next level - from a microwave that looked brand new to doggy poo bags conveniently located in the back yard. I enjoyed being able to walk to the beach easily each morning, with no worries about where to park! We’d definitely visit Joe and Michelle again!"
1624,22,"This is a very clean, updated space. It's small but cozy- has everything you need. Very close to beach and restaurants. This is one of the few AirBnBs that doesn't have a lot of stairs, which we were looking for since one of our dogs is 16."
1625,22,"clean, close to the beach, fantastic rocking chair front porch, walkable restaurants, well-appointed kitchen, spacious king bedroom. the “fireplace” is the most precious element!! run it in the winter for warmth, or in the summer without the heat, for the coziest atmosphere. if you’re visiting in chilly times, bring a pair of slippers since there is only one area rug and the hardwood/laminate floors are cold. very clean, just cold — which can be easily mitigated. the owners have two homes on the lot, as clearly advertised. no surprises. i had plenty of privacy, but would consider going back with friends renting the other property too, since it is a great balance of individual space and proximity. speaking of proximity, the beach isn’t as close as advertised… it’s closer!! and the lake with it’s accessible, flat, paved walking trail is even closer! that lake park really won my heart. the cottage is a gem among a neighborhood of homogenous relatively-new-builds on stilts."
1626,22,Very communicative and helpful hosts!!
1627,24,Absolutely loved Olivia. Definitely was one of my fav unique stays
1628,24,"This property is so neat. Kendra has done an amazing job renovating this airstream. The location is great for the beach, a quick 10-15 minute drive. There are lots of great restaurants nearby and lots to do. The back yard space is partitioned off nicely to give you the secluded feel.

Kendra was a great host. She was very proactive and made the check in and out process quite easy."
1629,24,Kendra and Travis’s place is a great place to stay! The site was nice and fun for us! The communication was excellent! The surrounding area had lots of things to do! We definitely would stay again in the future!
1630,24,Super cute little spot. Thank you for having us!!
1631,24,"Hi Cheyenne, thank you for your feedback and yes, it definitely makes more sense as far as getting a good value to book for more than one night.
Thanks again!"
1632,24,Olivia is the cutest little place to come home to! It was so fun and such a great experience. Kendra and Travis were very quick to reply to all of our questions and were super friendly! When we come back to the Wilmington area we would love to stay here again!
1633,24,Such a lovely place! Perfect for our trip very quiet and relaxing!
1634,24,Kendra was accommodating and responsive. The camper is beautiful and was exactly like they described. The s’mores was an amazing addition to enjoy with the nighttime bonfire. Thanks for the amazing stay!
1635,24,Very relaxing
1636,24,Fun and unique stay! would book it again.
1637,24,This was the best Airbnb I have ever stayed in. They had such a personal touch on their place! We loved staying there and I would recommend to anyone who needs a place to stay in Wilmington!
1638,24,We loved staying here! Wonderful hosts and was a great place to relax. We loved the hot tub and fire pit and all of the decorations made the stay so cozy. Great location too!
1639,24,"We had such an amazing time staying at Kendra’s Airstream! The firepit, smores kit, and hot tub were such a treat and the location of the Airstream is very safe, private, and close to amazing restaurants in Wilmington. Definitely a 5/5 experience!"
1640,24,"A very well-kept, peaceful, and relaxing stay! A true oasis! Kendra and Travis are wonderful hosts! They have done a fabulous job paying close attention to detail to ensure a wonderful and relaxing stay. You will not be disappointed in booking this treasure! Highly recommend!"
1641,24,"This Airbnb was next level!!! They thought of everything to make a very comfortable and fun stay! Fireplace, hot tub, comfortable bed and the decoration is amazing looks like it pop out of a magazine. Very well done guys!!!"
1642,24,Thank you so so so much Darla for your kind review! We appreciate y’all choosing to stay with us and so glad y’all enjoyed the space!!
1643,24,"charming getaway! Would definitely book again, we had a great stay."
1644,24,"We absolutely loved our stay! Our only regret is that we couldn’t stay longer! They’ve done an amazing job with everything, the atmosphere, the amenities, all of it! Definitely on our list of places to return!"
1645,24,"Can’t say enough about this place! We absolutely loved staying in the trailer and Kendra and Travis were super kind, flexible, and thorough! Really had a special stay- hopefully we will be back!"
1646,24,best getaway spot for a perfect couples retreat!
1647,24,Thank you for your kind review Tina! So glad y’all enjoyed your stay 😊
1648,24,FELT JUST LIKE HOME!! Will definitely be back!!!!
1649,24,"Exceptional getaway retreat! Kendra was an amazing host and we highly recommend staying at this property. Everything was clean and comfortable, and the location was amazing."
1650,24,"This place was amazing! Very clean, loved the ambiance, hot tub, and making a fire even with s’mores provided. Wonderful stay and nice hosts, hope to visit again!"
1651,24,"Tania, We are thrilled you enjoyed your stay and thank you so much for your kind review! We hope you come back for a visit soon😊"
1652,24,"Absolutely adorable glamping spot, perfect for a girls getaway weekend. Kendra and Travis have put a lot of love into restoring this 1974 vintage camper. Our hosts were helpful and attentive. We arrived on the coldest weekend Wilmington has ever seen and so we LOVED the cozy little inflatable hot tub right outside the door. The shower is against the curved wall and so a tall person might have to scrunch a bit, but so cute that it’s worth the scrunch!!"
1653,24,"It was adorable! Not only was it gorgeous, but it also managed to feel welcoming and homey. I would absolutely recommend and would love going back."
1654,24,Thank you Samantha for your kind review! You are welcome back anytime! We would love to host you again.
1655,24,The CUTEST and coziest spot! Every little detail just adds to the charm of the space. The fire pit area outside is nice to sit by with a drink. I love trendy tiny homes and rvs. And that’s exactly what this space was!
1656,24,Thank you Destiny for your kind review! We loved hosting you.
1657,24,This was a unique and fun experience to start 2023! I would recommend this place to everyone if you want a chill and relaxing place away from home.
1658,24,Thank you so much for your kind review Chelsea!!
1659,24,Beautiful home!
1660,24,Thank you Dalia for your kind review and please come back anytime!
1661,24,"I absolutely loved staying at “Olivia” and Kendra was an excellent host. She made it all easy: getting there, checking in, parking, contacting her, and checking out. I couldn’t have asked for more. Highly recommend for folks looking to explore Wilmington as it’s a 20-minute drive to the historic district. A word to the wise that this may not be the ideal stay for tall folks as the bed and shower are best suited for those in the 5-5.5 ft and under range. Also skip it if you must have a long hot shower (it’s a camper and it does specify this in the listing). But if you love the aesthetic in the pictures trust me - it’s even better in person. I could stay here by myself for a week and feel like I’m at a private yoga retreat. As a couple, one night was perfect. We got lucky and it rained at night which was an awesome sound to fall asleep to. Didn’t get a chance to try the hot tub but it’s super cute."
1662,24,Thank you Mary!
1663,24,Kendra and Travis were amazing hosts! Very kind and helpful if we needed anything. The space was beautiful and cozy and close to great sites in Wilmington! We can’t wait to tell our family and friends about this place and all the memories made here.
1664,24,Thank you so much David for your kind review! Great guests like y’all is why we love hosting! Thank you again
1665,24,"We enjoyed my birthday stay! All of the features of our stay were great. The backyard was private and cozy, the hot tub worked great (20 degrees that night), and the fire was a nice touch. Would recommend!"
1666,24,Thank you Victor for your kind review!
1667,24,Always wanted to stay in a airstream and finally got the chance. Very cool renovations.
1668,24,We had a great stay. The place looked exactly like the photos. It was very clean and nicely decorated. The Airstream is beautifully renovated such a unique and fun Air bnb. Thank you!
1669,24,Such a lovely spot! Super clean and so wonderfully decorated. The hot tub and outdoor area was perfect for relaxing after a beach day. The hosts were super helpful and responsive. Definitely a great spot and so so cool!
1670,24,Really enjoyed our stay here! Kendra is a thoughtful and attentive host. Highly recommend!
1671,24,"Kendra and Travis have made such a wonderful place to retreat with this glamping experience. It was so fun to have not only a bonfire to utilize but also a hot tub outside! It had plenty of spots to sit, eat, read, or just chill whether you wanted to be outdoors or indoors. The inside of Olivia is so fun and unique. I absolutely loved my stay here!!!"
1672,24,Thank you Marissa for your kind review! Please come stay with us again anytime!
1673,24,Kendra’s home is amazing! Such a cool experience and they’ve literally thought of everything to make you feel right at home!! Would DEF stay here again next time I’m in Wilmington!!

1678,24,Thank you Kaila for your kind review! We would love to host you anytime again!
1679,24,"We had a great, relaxing time here and really appreciated all the care put into everything! It was private, cozy, romantic, and would definitely go again. We cannot recommend this place enough!"
1680,24,Thank you Mona for your kind review! We would love to host you again anytime!!
1681,24,Loved this stay ! great communication with the host would definitely stay again !
1682,24,Thank you Hailey! We loved hosting you and you’re welcome back anytime 😊
1683,24,Perfect experience! Everything was clean and comfortable. Especially loved the outside deck and fire pit. Would stay again!
1684,24,Thank you Savanah! We are so thrilled to hear you enjoyed your stay and we welcome you back anytime:)
1685,24,"Kendra & Travis we’re the best hosts we have ever worked with on AirBnB. They’re communication was prompt & instructions easy. They genuinely cared about checking In with us throughout the trip. It was our engagement weekend and they even left a little surprise! Cannot wait to visit them again in the future!

Thank you!"
1686,24,Thank you so very much for your kind review. We hope to have the chance to host your future stays and we are so grateful for such kind and sincere new friends!
1687,24,I would recommend this space for anyone looking for a quiet unique space. Kendra and Travis were great with communication and every detail of the stay was thought through. Definitely would stay again!!
1688,24,Thank you so much Hollie for your kind review. It means the world to us that you enjoyed your stay and we hope to have the opportunity to host you again!
1689,24,Lovely stay. We enjoyed the glamping experience and the airstream hadeverything we needed.
1690,24,"This is the best little get away spot. The owners were the absolute sweetest. Olivia is such an experience, not just an airstream! The had a projector we set up outside while we were by the fire pit! Thank you so much for dreaming up this gem and creating it to share with everyone! We made friends and would definitely go back!"
1691,24,"I came with my new husband on our honeymoon, we were a but surprised by just how tiny the interior was, but it turned out to be super cozy and comfortable. Communication with the hosts was always very immediate and they answered all of our questions. The hot tub was super nice, and they did a good job of making it seem like an isolated lot despite the location. Only downside was the shower did not stay hot for more than five minutes, but that should be expected with the circumstances."
1692,24,Just amazing!! Everything was perfect. What you pay for is what you get. Close to all the common attractions and some amazing food places. Very caring host.
1693,24,"Amazing stay, although a little cold place was amazing will be coming again for sure. The hot tub and little yard was a plus♥️"
1694,24,Great stay in costal Carolina! Nicely renovated airstream with everything I needed. The outdoor space is lovely & relaxing!
1695,24,"We visited for our fifth anniversary and it was a blast. The airstream is small, but cozy. Perfect for a couples get away. The outdoor area is a whole vibe at night with overhead lights, a hot tub, and fire pit. In the morning it was quiet enough for me to have caught a nice meditation despite being pretty close to a main road. All around a great place to relax and very private considering the location which puts you 10-15 minutes from either the beach or the downtown area and moments from many stores and restaurants. Kendra and Travis are great hosts and we're responsive but gave us plenty of space and privacy. It was an awesome location that we will for sure revisit if we find ourselves back in Wilmington!"
1696,24,"Olivia was an amazing vibe with great amenities and the prefect amount of space indoor & outdoor. Olivia is super stylish and definitely a top tier stay. The hot tub was a total mood (we were able to see the moon through the canopy of trees and it was absolutely stunning). We all agreed that being able to make s’mores around a campfire like we did as kids really made it feel like our home away from home. We also discovered that Olivia was conveniently located in walking distance to a local brewery, Outer Dunes. We absolutely loved our stay! 10/10- highly recommend ✌🏼"
1697,24,This charming space did not disappoint. The host thought of everything!!! I felt like I was in my own little sanctuary. Communication was superb❤️
1698,24,AMAZING!! We loved every minute of our stay. Kendra and Travis are so accommodating and thought of everything we could’ve needed (including s’mores!!!!) absolutely will be back 😊
1699,24,Talk about a unique experience! The Airstream is the epitome of tiny living and well furnished and stocked. There are so many touches that make it feel like home. Kendra and Travis are wonderful hosts. They go above and beyond to make sure you are satisfied.
1700,24,"Such an amazing place and amazing hosts. So accommodating and kind, checked in on us and provided even more than we could’ve asked for!"
1701,24,"Our stay at the Olivia was amazing! Such a cute and comfortable space, in a great location. Short drive to the beach and downtown Wilmington for some great food! Kendra and Travis communicate well and want make sure you have everything you need for your stay. Great stay all-around."
1702,24,"Everything was very clean and convenient, communication was perfect and made it easy if we ever needed anything."
1703,24,A peaceful retreat in a convenient location!
1704,24,Very friendly and helpful host! This place was very cute and zen. Would stay again if we are ever back in Wilmington!
1705,24,"Ya'll. This was an oasis. I couldn't believe I was lucky enough to find and stay at such a beautiful place in the most idea location - for the beach! The value was absolutely priceles. It had everything we needed and more, and felt luxurious. Also private, didn't seem like a backyard. Kendra is incredibly sweet and I genuinely felt I could have asked anything and she'd be there. Take me back! lol"
1706,24,"I can't say enough to adequately describe our stay. We had a hectic week, but every night we had a quiet retreat with privacy and cooking. We didn't use the hot tub or fire pit, but it was so welcoming."
1707,24,We had the best time and loved Olivia.
1708,24,"A great find with the beautiful updated vintage airstream and private outdoor space feeling like ‘paradise lost’ .
Artistic and artisanal touches abounded in every space. Thoughtfully and creatively done too.

The cool morning breezes and nigh time sounds of frogs and cicadas from the infamous Wilmington ‘live oaks’ eased you into the calming spirit of ‘coastal living,’

Wonderful hosts accompanied by airstream ‘nomadic’ living.. But with access to nearby city and coastal cultural and historic attractions for all,.

Don’t miss out on this rare find."
1709,24,"We had such a wonderful stay in Kendra’s airstream! It truly felt like a little oasis and was located so close to everything we wanted to see (downtown Wilmington, Wrightsville Beach & Topsail Beach). Everything is top notch - from the cleanliness of the space, the greenery and landscaping of the outdoor areas, the power of the air conditioning (crucial during NC summers), the comfortability of the beds, the cozy hot tub, and all of the fine details (beautiful decor, extra towels were provided for our dogs’ paws, individually wrapped tooth brushes and make-up remover wipes - to name a few!). On top of all of that, Kendra and Travis are so kind and accommodating of questions or extra requests. They are very responsive and it was obvious they wanted to make our stay as enjoyable as possible (which was easy given how beautiful the property is!). I can’t recommend Kendra’s little Wilmington oasis enough!"
1710,24,"This was a phenomenal stay! Probably the best spot we stayed on our Southern Tour, certainly the most unique. The hosts have done a wonderful job curating this space, and while it's good for friends and solo travelers it's also terribly romantic. The hosts are also very kind and helpful!"
1711,24,Absolutely adorable!!!!! Recommended to friends and family
1712,24,excellent place to stay! they literally provided almost everything you’d need for your stay plus more! very nice trustworthy people!
1713,24,"Very happy with our one night stay! Loved the opportunity to stay in a refurbished Airstream - it was well kept, decorated and very clean."
1714,24,We had a great stay! The pictures are very accurate. The van was designed with a great attention to detail and the hosts are very responsive! It is a glamping experience so be sure to close the door and avoid leaving any food out on the counter. We would definitely stay here again!
1715,24,Great stay! Aesthetic of the space is great and the layout of the airstream is very well thought out. A wonderful spot for a short mini vacation or anniversary night
1716,24,"This is a wonderful getaway!

My wife and I spent our 1st wedding anniversary in Wilmington and made a great decision staying here! Kendra and Travis were great hosts, and were very intentional in communication and in making sure our needs during our stay were met.

What you see the photos is exactly what you get, if not more! It is so nice!

If you’re looking for the nice, cozy and secluded feeling airstream experience but also accessibility to the Wilmington area, places to eat, and other amenities, this is a great choice!"
1717,24,"Loved the style of the Airstream, so glad we stayed here rather than a hotel."
1718,24,"Can’t say enough positives about our stay!! It was wonderful..with so many thoughtful touches…from the lovely welcome card, delicious coffee and cozy linens to the beautiful deck and hot tub and fenced in area..it is a delightful place! The neighborhood is safe and quiet yet a short drive to beaches and shopping. Kendra and Travis could not have been more accommodating and flexible with our needs which I really appreciated.
I will definitely stay again…if I’m lucky enough to find availability for our travel dates!"
1719,24,"What a perfect stay! Vintage charm, cozy, peaceful and quiet in a beautiful location. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat. :)"
1720,24,"We are thrilled you enjoyed your stay at Olivia, Briana! You were a delightful guest and love you back anytime."
1721,24,"Y’all… this is Glamping at its best!!! You gotta try this place! It’s so cool, unique and fun… plus it’s near the beach!"
1722,24,Excellent host 10/10 🙏
1723,24,Surreal place! One of my best Airbnb experiences hands down. The camper is an aesthetic and has plenty of room with storage for all luggage. The area is also fenced in and has privacy with a comfortable area to hang out. This stay included everything we needed. Everything worked great; the bathrooms were comfortable and the AC worked great. The place is also about 10 minutes from the beach. Will plan on coming back next time we’re in Wilmington!
1724,24,Very adorable!
1725,24,The cutest Airbnb!
1726,24,Thanks Kimberly! We are so happy you enjoyed the space.
1727,25,If you’re looking for a quiet getaway this place might not fit in that description. There was loud banging from the unit upstairs at 11pm and then 8 am. The space did not feel private and there were no snacks. It was clean and the view was nice but with the loudness of the unit above + all the extra fees you have to pay after the base price of the place I wouldn’t drive all the way up a mountain to stay here.
1728,25,"Hello Abby

Thank you for taking the time to leave a review of your recent stay at our property. We are glad that you found the space to be clean and well-maintained, and we appreciate your positive feedback on our check-in process and communication.

We apologize for any noise disturbances you experienced during your stay as it is typically very quiet in this area. We are unsure what the noise was at that hour as no one was in the unit above during those times, but it's possible that it could have been caused by a limb falling hitting the metal roof during the strong winds around that time.

Regarding the snacks, we apologize for any confusion. We state in the listing that we have a shared food bar where you can find many changeable pantry staples and non-perishable items in the cabinet, and we also leave some snacks on the table such as trail bars, chips, candy, or other variable offerings. We would have been happy to explain where the snacks were or provided extra if this was brought to our attention during your stay.

Lastly, we want to clarify about the pricing as hosts do not charge the extra fees you mentioned. These fees are placed on by this platform for their service fees as well as taxes, and unfortunately, hosts do not have the ability to change or reduce these fees. You will find these extra fees to be standard across this booking platform. Final prices are always noted before confirming any reservation. Kindly check these prices and ensure it suits your budget before you reserve any future stays. We set our prices to be competitive for this area while typically offering more in return.

Once again, thank you for choosing our property for your stay. We strive to host peaceful retreat in the mountains
away from the hustle and bustle that most of our guest’s crave now a days. There are many kinds of stays for every kind of person here and we hope you are able to find ones that suit your particular needs in the future."
1729,25,"Cute and cozy studio tucked away in the NC mountains. Definitely make sure to download any content you’ll want ahead of time—or embrace being semi-off-the-grid for a bit. The dirt road up to the cabin is a little uneven, probably best for a car with higher suspension (although my Honda Civic did ok). I loved sitting on the porch in the warm weather and playing darts. The cabin is warm and welcoming in the cold, too, with a fireplace-style heater to make it feel especially cozy. Beware of the cold bathroom (make sure to turn on the heat switch before you need a shower). Loved it!"
1730,25,Exactly as advertised. Clean and very peaceful. Direction were very easy to follow.
1731,25,"This was one of the best air bnb stays I have had!! Tiffany was great and super clear in arrival instructions because this is more secluded!! The area is beautiful and it is the perfect little tree house for a peaceful get away!! It is also super close to asheville, black mountain, and chimney rock. 10/10 recommend!"
1732,25,everything went as expected- the listing was very detailed and we knew exactly what to expect. Perfect private retreat for couples or friends!
1733,25,This place was absolutely amazing. A beautiful place to stay and recharge. Can’t wait to go back!!
1734,25,Great! Definitely READ the check-in instructions. I did and found the place easily. A lovely retreat.
1735,25,"Remote location perfect for a little getaway, and only 30 mins from downtown! We loved our time here :)"
1736,25,Beautiful location very homey feeling!
1737,25,Great place and location
1738,25,This place was perfect for what it is. Quiet and private studio style apartment deep in the mountains. Exactly what I wanted for a quiet day to myself without outside distractions
1739,25,"Beautiful and private place to relax and enjoy the outdoors, the inside was very clean and will definitely book again."
1740,25,it was a great stay! Thanks for being so welcoming!
1741,25,Different place if you want to relax and be disconnected of everything. Beautiful place to share with nature. Highly recommend
1742,25,Wonderful quiet getaway. Very much enjoyed this well needed weekend away from the world.
1743,25,"This is the best place my husband and I have stayed at. Quaint and peaceful. Even in the winter, the scenery is breathtaking. We’ll definitely be staying here again on our next N.C. trip!"
1744,25,My boyfriend and I had a wonderful weekend at the tree house. It was a beautiful place to stay and had everything we needed. It was also a short drive to Chimney Rock!
1745,25,"Great secluded location, very nice inside and out, and she was very helpful in responding to my never ending questions lol!"
1746,25,"This place is very clean, rustic, and peaceful.
It's hard to find so get there before dark. Tiffany does have extensive directions which is helpful.
The porch rustic interior, and the secluded mountain surroundings makethis place so peaceful and wonderful."
1747,25,"Very cozy, and really clean! Adored the deck space - wished we could’ve used it more, but it was pretty chilly out! Great secluded mountain stay"
1748,25,"My stay with my partner was everything I could've asked for. The directions to get to the cabin were extremely clear, and the cabin itself was identical to the pictures. Very clean, feels new, and has a beautiful view. Even her wifi router worked perfectly for my phone. My only complaint is that we didn't stay longer! Thank you so much Tiffany, you, along with your home, are wonderful ! We hope to book again soon ! :)"
1749,25,We absolutely loved this cabin and our trip here. It was such a peaceful location and the interior was so cozy and comfortable. 10 out of 10 would recommend if you’re looking for a relaxing getaway in beautiful mountain scenery.
1750,25,Very cozy— about 30 minutes from Asheville and Chimney rock state park so great location if you don’t mind a short drive:) Super pretty area and very warm inside with the fireplace. Very nice to unplug and relax.
1751,25,Perfect for a relaxing and peaceful weekend! The place had everything we could need and bed was very comfortable. I would definitely stay again!
1752,25,Really quite spot. Everything was clean and we highly recommend!
1753,25,The Happy Place tree house was perfect for our get-away in the woods. It's a one room efficiency but very spacious and immaculately clean with a cozy feel. It's nestled well into the woods and from the bed you get a beautiful morning view of a nearby ridge crest. I only wish we had been there when it was warm enough to enjoy the large deck area.
1754,25,So easy to communicate with and such a cozy cute place to stay! So enjoyed this stay!
1755,25,"My husband and I had a wonderful time staying in the downstairs unit. It is truly a beautiful location and it was so nice to get off the beaten path and stay in such a quiet and peaceful spot. The place was very comfortable and close to some great locations to explore, making for a great weekend! Would stay here again!"
1756,25,"Tiffany was accommodating, gave great instructions on how to arrive, and responded quickly to comments. Great host"
1757,25,"A great location, with great views and a super awesome host!"
1758,25,"This place was great, especially for just an evening away. Quite, safe, and reenergizing; just nice to get away."
1759,25,Loved it!!! Thank you so much for an escape!
1760,25,"Everything was perfect...comfortable bed, nice bathroom/shower, kitchen had all we needed. Plus, such a wonderful location!"
1761,25,"Clean and tidy with comfortable bed. Beautiful location nestled in the woods. Tiffany was very responsive and helpful and provided extremely clear check in instructions and directions to her secluded treehouse. Would recommend 4-wheel drive as the road leading up can be a bit hairy, especially in the rain or at night. Internet and cell service were non-existent for me but I wanted to unplug so it was a positive. Had a great time escaping for a weekend :)"
1762,25,We had such a short but sweet stay at the Treehouse! So private & secluded. We enjoyed hanging out on the porch playing darts & listening to nature. Definitely recommend!
1763,25,"We were disappointed. This place is clearly a studio apartment, and not a one bedroom. The listing identifies it as one bedroom which is what we expected. The bed, living area and kitchen is all in one large room."
1764,25,"Hello Marcy!

Thank you for sharing this feedback.!

Accuracy in my listing is very important to me. Unfortunately, Airbnb does not have a “studio” designation at this time.

However, the listing description and photos clearly and accurately depict the space and layout. Please ensure you review the listing descriptions and photos thoroughly moving forward to ensure you book spaces which suit your needs to avoid any future misunderstandings.

Best of luck in your future stays!"
1765,25,Pleasant stay in a peaceful setting.
1766,25,It’s a great spot away from everything. Definitely worth the drive out of the way and close enough to get to all that Asheville has to offer!
1767,25,Wonderful stay!
1768,25,Amazing stay! Perfect little spot with everything you could need. Not too bad of a drive to Asheville. Felt very homey and I loved the outdoor deck. Darts & a swing & a hammock. It was beautiful.
1769,25,"Beautiful and relaxing space. The descriptions are very accurate. Lovely, clean home with lovely views. Relaxing and enjoyable stay."
1770,25,Asheville was an incredible place to hang out. There is a vibrant art scene and plenty of shopping as well as adventure opportunities.
1771,25,All in loved the experience - this is a great place to stay for anyone who needs to disconnect from all the things!
1772,25,"The pics don’t even do it justice, it was so beautiful and peaceful! Thank you for a relaxing escape from hurricane Ian! We loved every minute!"
1773,25,Cute little cabin! Fun being in the woods on a mountain side!
1774,25,"Beautiful stay in the mountains, absolutely loved every minute. Descriptions and directions were accurate and easy to follow. Definitely would stay again!"
1775,25,Adorable place - definitely recommend if you need a place to stay on the road but pick up dinner on the way 😊
1776,25,Wonderful beautiful stay in the mountains! We will be back!
1777,25,Loved the location and beautiful mountain side. The wifi was helpful for streaming some music and was accurately described in the listing. The only sadness was the early check out time. Check in at 4pm and out by 10am left little time to enjoy this beautiful space in the morning time.
1778,25,beautiful place with amazing views
1779,25,"Tiffany was an amazing host for our woodsy getaway! Great listing, off the grid and beautiful. Great communication."
1780,25,"We enjoyed the hammock & swing chair on the beautiful deck overlooking the forest. It was quiet and we enjoyed the time in nature.
Please note that internet access may or may not be available. This was ok for us on this trip as we were there to get away and relax!"
1781,25,"Tiffany’s home is one of a kind! We only had enough time to stay the night in her wonderful cabin in the woods, but we are definitely going to come back for longer soon! Her home was spotless, incredibly roomy, and the outdoor space she created on the porch is so cozy - there’s nothing quite like being able to disconnect from the world, hanging in a hammock, listen to all the crickets chirp as the sun goes down."
1782,25,"Beautiful location deep in the woods, pretty much rain forest. No cell service 20 minutes before arriving. Not a tree house, rather small studio apartment with a tree growing through the deck. Washer and dryer in unit big bonus. Nice inside apartment, electric fireplace was a nice touch. Comfortable bed. No tv and limited satellite internet, no books or games provided. Very small shower, open on 2 sides with shower curtain. Shower curtain was moldy, dirty and smelly."
1783,25,Beautiful and peaceful place to stay! Loved it! Highly recommend
1784,25,Amazing place to stay and disconnect from the world a bit. 10/10 would stay here again!
1785,25,"Great! Relaxing and peaceful.

Definitely recommend all wheel drive and a higher clearance vehicle, especially if it’s muddy/rainy/snowy."
1786,25,Everything about our stay was wonderful! Tiffany was a great host and the home was so charming.
1787,25,"Peaceful and lovely place in the woods. Super comfortable bed and beautiful view. Had everything we needed for a quiet and peaceful weekend. The deck was our favorite place, played lots of darts and relaxed in the swing and/or hammock. Would definitely stay again. Location was great for where I needed to be and not far at all from Asheville or downtown Black Mountain."
1788,25,"beautiful, quiet place to get away ontop of a mountain."
1789,25,Tiffany's AirBnb was gorgeous and clean! It truly felt like an escape from reality and waking up to the forest views was wonderful. It's definitely a bit off the beaten path and the dirt road was a little rough on our sedan after the previous night's rain. Highly recommend if you're looking for a rural mountain getaway to unplug and unwind!
1790,25,wonderful stay :)
1791,25,We very much enjoyed our stay. The tree house is very nice and clean. It's secluded but also not too far away from Black Mtn and Asheville. We will return!
1792,25,"This was a surprise birthday trip for my husband and he absolutely loved it! The Happy Place is certainly a place we would visit again for a longer time. Tiffany's directions with pictures were super helpful and made the house easy to find. We were able to connect to the internet seemlessly and although there's no TV; with games, nature, and if you have a laptop or portable DVD player you don't miss it at all. It was the perfect mini getaway just being able to relax outside of the city! Thank you Soo Soo much! We will definitely be back ☺️"
1793,25,Perfect getaway location!
1794,25,We had a delightful stay. The space is charming and peaceful. We had our coffee/tea on the porch every morning. Read books in the hammock; and walked the “neighborhood”. Tiffany is a great host and adds sweet details to the space to make it even more charming!
1795,25,"Cozy and clean place immersed in nature - perfect for an escape from the city. Internet was definitely too slow for working remotely, but enough to get directions to local coffee shops!"
1796,25,"Very cute place to stay! Porch is beautiful, and the host provided lots of amenities and was great with communication!"
1797,25,"great secluded spot with a fantastic deck for yoga, relaxation and meditation. Great place to disconnect and recharge."
1798,25,"Tiffany's place is a lovely, secluded spot for a restful time. I took a solo trip and stayed for two days and really enjoyed it."
1799,25,Awesome place to relax and enjoy nature! We enjoyed the deck a lot!
1800,25,Amazing spot for a tech free getaway! Tiffany is super nice and reliable!
1801,25,"Wonderful secluded location. There's a lot of information on the rental information, but it was an easy stay. Wifi worked just fine and got phone reception and internet (without verizon). Really beautiful studio with a comfy porch."
1802,25,Tiffany’s house is absolutely beautiful and nestled in the mountains. This was a perfect place to disconnect (really because there was very little service) and the internet is pretty spotty. It’s a perfect location just 30 minutes from Asheville and the mountain! We highly recommend staying here 🥰
1803,25,"The place is great to getaway and very remote, quiet to enjoy the peace and quiet nature."
1804,25,Beautiful place with proper amenities. Follow the tips for preparation and getting there and you'll be set up for a great hidden spot for a few days of peace and fun. Cant wait to come back!
1805,25,Tiffany was absolutely fantastic! Descriptions are spot on and check in super easy. Great location for the secluded mountain trip that’s also close by to the hussle and bussle of Asheville!
1806,25,great romantic getaway very close to black mountain!my girlfriend and and I loved Tiffanys' tree house property.nice and private with no outside distractions!
1807,25,"We had a great stay at Tiffany’s place! Everything was immaculately clean and ready to go upon our arrival. It was a comfortable, cozy space and she’s done great work to make it feel larger than it actually is — I felt like we had everything and all the space we needed. Overall a great stay far removed from the bustle of cars and traffic, but still close enough to Asheville to easily get there within 30-40 minutes.

It was not as hard to get to as I anticipated but take your time on the dirt road, there are fairly deep ruts the closer you get to the unit. You shouldn’t need 4-wheel drive at all, maybe if it’s wet, but I’ve been on far worse dirt roads and managed just fine. Cell service (Verizon) dropped about 5 minutes before arriving.

The deck was awesome and the hammocks were super comfortable, I wish we’d used them more. Having darts was a great touch too.

The jug of mountain spring water in the kitchen was an unexpected but excellent touch and very tasty. I nearly drank the entire thing.

Do be aware that this place is pretty deep into the woods, so bugs are everywhere at night. This isn’t a complaint, I’m simply pointing out that this is truly an “out there” kind of location so bugs should be expected."
1808,25,We enjoyed our stay at the treehouse! It’s a unique location/bnb. We enjoyed sitting outside in the morning and evening listening to birds and the water stream nearby. Everything was just as the listing is described! The directions were very detailed and beyond helpful. Definitely recommend if you’re looking for a place to relax and reset!
1809,25,The treehouse was so beautiful and quaint. The space was quiet and perfect for a weekend getaway. It was clean and peaceful. I would definitely recommend this to anyone!
1810,25,Tiffany’s treehouse is exactly as described and exactly what I needed for a recharge. It is perfect as could be for a lovely stay in the mountains with peace and quiet in an amazing setting. I felt like I had my own little piece of heaven in the woods. The place is spotless with cozy decor and all the amenities you need for total comfort. I would definitely stay again when I’m in the area.
1811,25,"If you’re looking for a quiet vacation surrounded by trees with no reception - book Tiffany’s treehouse! The place was tidy and described 100% accurately per the listing. Tiffany is a timely and effective communicator. I had no issues getting to the location that is tucked away on a lovely mountainside. I was also surprised by a few snacks after the long road trip. The distance and time listed in the description are also accurate. You’ll want to plan ahead if on a strict timeline for the Biltmore or a hike. Thank you, Tiffany, for a lovely stay! I also appreciated the pots & pans, along with a stove to cook breakfast & dinner."
1812,25,"What a BEAUTIFUL PLACE! The inside of the cabin wayyy exceeded my expectations and was so clean and beautiful. It was very secluded, but the drive to black mountain for dinner was so beautiful we didn’t mind it at all. I highly recommend staying here! Tiffany is an excellent host and we felt very taken care of! Also I’m glad there were so many directions for how to get there in case our phones stopped working, but our maps brought us the whole way which was great."
1813,25,"I definitely recommend the Happy Place Treehouse to anyone looking to spend time in nature and get away from a busy city lifestyle. It was the perfect size and extremely clean inside. The treehouse is within 30 minutes to the town of Black Mountain, making it easy to explore the town. I would definitely stay here again!"
1814,25,"Such a beautiful little retreat! The way the sun shines through the windows is so beautiful and calming. Most importantly, Tiffany’s stay was so clean and organised!"
1815,25,"Couldn't have asked for a more relaxing experience. The travel there and just the views all around were mind-blowing. Looking forward to more stays!

The hammocks are PERFECT. Dart Board was a lot off fun under the lighted deck. Fireplace was a perfect touch with both heat and AC. if needed."
1816,25,The place was great!
1817,25,"Gorgeous house with serene, beautiful views, very pretty winding road to and from, loved having coffee on the porch and will definitely be checking this spot out again and recommending it to visitors. Perfect getaway!"
1818,25,An amazing get-away to unplug from it all. Everything was as described. A hidden gem!
1819,25,"Exactly as pictured, way up in the hills. Nice deck area for relaxing. Internet service is available but it's very slow, just something to keep in mind. Place was very clean and offered quality amenities. Great spot for a weekend getaway."
1820,25,Loved staying at Tiffany’s treehouse in the woods! Such a fantastic spot to unwind. I showed up at nighttime and woke up to the most beautiful view. The place was super clean and you can tell that Tiffany put a lot of thought into all of the details. Self check in was super smooth. Such a treat - highly recommend!
1821,25,The place was so great and exactly how Tiffany described it. You feel like you are in your own private woods. It’s so serene and beautiful.
1822,25,Tiffany was great to work with!
1823,25,"Great place in secluded area, great views… snacks provided and easy to communicate with. Definitely recommend."
1824,25,"Tiffany's place is just wonderful. Its secluded yet very cozy and just so cute. I loved the connection with nature and the beautiful sounds of birds, plus waking up beside a window that sees the mountains and the trees plus a beautiful moon if you chose the right time to go. Its spectacularly clean. The directions to get there couldnt be clearer. Tiffany really went above and beyond preparing the place with everything needed. This was a very therapeutic experience for me and I would love go go there again."
1825,25,Host was very hospitable and helpful. I forgot to write down the wifi password before heading over and she was so kind in helping us get access. Definitely coming back!
1826,25,"My husband, 2 pups, and I loved this place! The host is very accommodating and easy to communicate with! We would recommend this tree house."
1827,25,Very easy to communicate with the host. Definitely no cell service so make sure to print the map and watch your odometer after you turn onto the dirt road. We initially didn’t go far enough because we were estimating 0.9 miles. The “Kimberly Rd.” is on a fence and we didn’t see it the first time when we saw the red gate that said “private property.”
1828,25,A cute place to unwind. We enjoyed our stay so much.
1829,25,This was one of the best Airbnb I have stayed at!!
1830,25,"This is a beautiful property, and exactly as pictured!"
1831,25,The treehouse was a really special place for us. It was so peaceful and beautiful in the surrounding area. If you’re in the Black Mtn area I highly recommend this location. The hostess was outstanding and the apartment was spotless. We’d definitely stay there again.
1832,25,Such a cute and cozy cabin! I would definitely stay here again.
1833,25,"We had an amazing stay at Tiffany’s treehouse.
Super clean ✅
Easy to get there, even in a small sedan car✅
Lovely view ✅
Snacks available ✅
Internet connection to scroll through social media✅
Beautiful house ✅"
1834,27,"Vince and Judy were wonderful, friendly hosts. Our stay was much better than a hotel. Very quiet and peaceful. We had a great time!"
1835,27,Delightful
1836,27,Wonderful place and exactly what I needed. Quiet and relaxing. Didn’t want to leave. Thank you!
1837,27,"First of all, Vincent and Judy were the most helpful hosts I've ever had since using AirBNB. The personalization that went behind all they put into the cabin was done with perfection. Definitely the best experience I've had so far."
1838,27,Such a perfect little cabin. I will certainly be back.
1839,27,great people! made us feel right at home. worth every penny
1840,27,"Awesome, comfortable, friendly experience thank you all so much. Strongly recommend!!"
1841,27,"Most adorable cabin and hosts. Pictures don't do this place justice, it's adorable. Both hosts are extremely kind and accommodating. I would recommend staying here for a quiet, peaceful getaway. Amazing!"
1842,27,My boyfriend and I visited the cabin again and enjoyed it just as much as the first time! Vince and Judy are so warm and welcoming and really made sure we were fully taken care of. Our stay was incredibly relaxing and recharging.
1843,27,"Vincent and his wife were the most amazing host we’ve ever had, they made our experience so welcome and wonderful that we decided to add another night to our stay. Everything was quite literally perfect and our stay was everything we hoped for, we will most definitely be booking again in the future."
1844,27,This cabin was built beautifully and was so peaceful. We had a great time and we highly recommend. The hosts were also incredibly sweet :)
1845,27,Loved my stay even though it was only over night! Will be back again for a longer stay to really enjoy it fully.
1846,27,if you are looking to get away for a nice and quite getaway this is a great place to go. Vincent and his wife gave us a tour upon arrival and we're just awesome guest and even gave us some fresh eggs from there chickens to have for breakfast the next morning could not have asked for a nice escape and peaceful tranquil night away. will def be back in the future.
1847,27,"We loved our stay at this cabin. It was so cozy and peaceful, we especially loved the fireplace. We really enjoyed the ability to unplug and just get away. Vincent and Judy truly thought about everything when setting up the cabin. All the furniture and decorations were so comfortable and relaxing. They were also very attentive and welcoming of us staying at their place. We felt at home and very relaxed from the moment we got there."
1848,27,If you are looking for a primitive style serenity this is the place. The hosts met us upon arrival did a tour of the cabin. We could’ve have asked for better hospitality. The cabin itself has everything you could possibly need. Loved the morning coffee off the porch bedroom. The fireplaces and personal touches were an added benefit. Surely did not want to leave as it felt like home. Would stay again anytime
1849,27,He and his wife are super great hosts! They showed us around and we’re very accommodating. We loved using the fireplace.
1850,27,Vincent and Judy make you feel right at home. It felt we've known them for years. We will be back again.
1851,27,Very nice place! Nice and Cozy! Hosts were super friendly and accommodating! We enjoyed our stay!
1852,27,"Our stay was amazing! The hospitality Vince and Judy provided made us feel like we were right at home! You’re not in mountains but boy does it feel that way! It was an experience we will never forget! It is so cozy and exactly what we needed! If you need a place to go to and disconnect, this is it!"
1853,27,"Vince and Judy were warm and friendly. The location was very nice & cozy. The cabin was perfect in every way, even the chocolates, juice, and coffee. We couldn't ask for a better host, and would certainly recommend it to travelers.

We will be back to visit them next year. Thanks again for a wonderful experience!

-Larry"
1854,27,This place surprised me I loved this place and location. The fireplace favorite feature. I was able to connect my phones hotspot for my oldest to watch a movie while I relaxed and rested. It was a short notice stay that was amazingly accommodated and Im glad. Didnt wanna leave and ready to come back for my own get away.
1855,27,Wonderful cozy cabin! Amazing hosts. I definitely will be coming back if I’m around anytime soon!
1856,27,Was very cozy. No tv reception but other than that was a very good place to stay.
1857,27,"We couldn't have asked for a more perfect stay. Everything was accommodating. The hosts were very friendly and hospitable. It was like being at home. My husband and I attended at wedding near by and we are so happy we didn't choose the motel in Burgaw. It's not far from small shopping but far enough where it's quiet and you feel disconnected, it's quiet and all you hear is nature. The squirrel are close and fun to watch. Bird feeders are close to enjoy. I have told everyone about my experience and I cannot wait to go back when my husband comes home from traveling!"
1858,27,"Cozy, cozy and cozy. Loved this little cabin. And will definitely be visiting again. It’s a perfect place for a mini gateway. It’s earthy and peaceful. The host is extremely kind and very well prepared for guests."
1859,27,"My wife and I had an amazing time staying with Vincent and Judy at their cabin near Burgaw. The hosts are so very friendly, we felt like we were staying with old friends or loving family. They showed us around the property, welcomed us into their home, and even treated us with a small loaf of freshly baked bread. We can’t wait to go back for another visit, as soon as our schedules allow."
1860,27,The cabin was perfect! It was warm and cozy and Vince and Judy were so kind. They provided coffee and creamer and plenty of firewood. It was the perfect spot for a getaway for the two of us!!
1861,27,"Vincent and his wife are fairly new to the AirBNB game but don’t let that scare you. They are both very hospitable hosts and incredibly kind people. The cabin is a great little outfit with a very cozy feel. The fireplace is a great touch to make you feel at home. The location is a little drive away from the major city areas; however, it provides a tranquil space perfect for getting away and exhaling. I would absolutely recommend this spot to anyone curious about it."
1862,27,"Vincent and his wife were so warm, welcoming, and accommodating! The cabin we stayed in was handcrafted and had cute, personal touches all over. This property is located fairly close to the main home, but this was not a problem because of how laid back the couple was! Will definitely book again!"
1863,27,Our stay was awesome. The check-in process was easy. Vince and Judith were awesome host!! Would definitely return!
1864,27,"Our stay here felt like a step into a fairy tale adventure. The beautiful hand crafted furniture sat neatly around the cobblestone fireplace, giving a perfect place to warm up and end your day. Rustic french doors lead out to a porch perfect for morning coffee as the birds sing around you. Finally the hospitality of the host from start to finish left me thinking with excitement about the next time I'll come to visit."
1865,27,"I liked the place, the comfortable house and the hosts were very friendly."
1866,28,The host had a very helpful binder that included instructions on checking out as well as small pieces of information about the place.
1867,28,Our second stay here. We love it!
1868,28,This place was great :)
1869,28,Super cozy and cool looking place to spend a weekend! Also very conveniently close to and yet removed from Boone. Thanks so much for a great stay!
1870,28,Was an absolute pleasure to stay at! It is in the perfection location that allows you to have the seclusion of being “in the wilderness” but also the convenience of being within proximity to just about everything! My only suggestion is maybe put some curtains over the front door for privacy (plus a giant glass door facing the woods always give me the creeps) other than that 10/10!
1871,28,Beautiful spot and great place! Jason was very communicative and accommodating.
1872,28,"We had an absolutely great stay! Best of all, the space was very clean, and the surrounding areas were absolutely beautiful."
1873,28,The Hut was absolutely happy. The creek outside was a dream. My son LOVED the loft room and we were cozy our entire stay. Thank you!
1874,28,Great homey stay close to Boone!
1875,28,"We had an amazing stay at Jason’s place! It was quiet—a few neighbors, but generally private area down a dirt road and only a 20 minute drive to Boone. The space is small and very quaint, we were provided everything that we needed! The welcome book contained lots of good information about the town (places to eat, night life, things to do, etc) as well as clear check out instructions. Our only problem was the front door doesn’t have any kind of covering on it—all glass. And while it does face the woods/creek with no neighbors in that direction, we were a little unsettled by it at night! That might have been because we were unfamiliar with the area and the neighborhood, but nonetheless, something to cover the door with when it got dark would have made us feel a little more comfortable. All in all, amazing place at an even better price!"
1876,28,"We really enjoyed our stay. The home was exactly as described and pictured on the site. Jason was very prompt when responding to our questions.
We only wished we had had better weather to enjoy the lovely little porch by the stream."
1877,28,Wonderful area. Restful and relaxing with great natural options nearby. Quiet. Peaceful.
1878,28,We had a wonderful stay!
1879,28,This place was so awesome! The hosts were responsive and helpful. We had the best time exploring Boone! We will be back.
1880,28,Wonderful place! Beautiful creek right outside your front door ❤️
1881,28,We had a wonderful time! It is so peaceful sitting on the porch listening to the running stream. The inside is so clean. I was shocked how beautiful and how well planned out the inside is! It was cozy and felt right at home!
1882,28,Perfect location - private but close to town. We have stayed in lots of places in the mountains but this might be our favorite
1883,28,Perfect for a little ski trip getaway!
1884,28,"It is a great and charming place, spring water, quiet"
1885,28,Great place! Appalachian ski resort is perfect for beginners!
1886,28,"Very cozy and adorable, loved the privacy and how clean the place was."
1887,28,Loved staying in the Hut! Would definitely stay again.
1888,28,"Awesome little spot, perfect for what we needed!"
1889,28,"Good value, beautiful rental. Has everything you need. Stayed warm even in freezing temperatures.

Make sure to read the welcome book as there is a detailed checkout/cold weather procedure. Also, the wood stove is off limits which was a little disappointing but understandable for an Airbnb.

Only hiccup we had was that when we arrived, the previous guests were still checking out. The hosts apologized and told us we could wait or come back later, we went into town for dinner and when we came back everything was good to go. To be fair, we booked on very short notice so I understand if the hosts were surprised by our quick arrival.

Overall, it’s a beautiful rental on a beautiful property. Everything was clean and organized. I had a great stay."
1890,28,This is quite possibly our favorite Airbnb ever. This place is beautiful and extremely clean. The location is peaceful yet close enough to enjoy the local town. Jason was a great host and quick to respond. They even decorated for Christmas! 10/10 best Airbnb! Highly recommend!
1891,28,Great stay here. So cute and clean inside.
1892,28,"The CUTEST Airbnb ever!! The size of the outside look is deceiving to the space inside; the space inside is divided very well and has everything you need! If I could live here 24/7 i would! Nice hot water, comfy beds, everything was amazing!! I do plan on booking here whenever I visit my second home from now on!!"
1893,28,"It was the cutest little hut, and despite having others around it still felt private. Clear instructions before checking out, and very accommodating."
1894,28,"A perfect getaway, highly recommend."
1895,28,"The pictures are very accurate. Make sure you study them closely as loft access requires some agility. Very convenient to Boone but also very much away from it all. Make sure to save a few hours to sit on the ""front"" porch (which is actually in the back). Amazingly restful vibe."
1896,28,Best airbnb I've ever been to!
1897,28,"Great place! Right on a creek. Inside was comfortable with everything you need.
Will come back again"
1898,28,Had an amazing stay here. Loved the location and their binder with information and instructions. Very helpful. Will definitely be back. Better than the pictures.
1899,28,"This spot was just what I needed. The location was fabulous, the house was very clean, and the atmosphere was cozy."
1900,28,"Wow! What a perfect place of peace! This was the best home in the mountains we could have asked for. Cozy, yet spacious. A fully equipped kitchen and lots of attention to detail. We felt right at home and never wanted to leave. Thank you for a beautiful retreat!"
1901,28,"This place was amazing. About 20 to 30 minutes outside Boone and perfectly peaceful and remote. We enjoyed the comfort and quiet as we relaxed and enjoyed our time away.

We saw a plenty of wildlife (deer, rabbits, fox squirrels and chipmunks) as we would eat meals and look out the French doors.

10/10 would stay again."
1902,28,Had a blast at this little hut. Wouldn’t mind coming back!
1903,28,"What a unique place! We loved all the different woods and decor. The space was utilized so well and we could tell a lot of thought went into the design of the house. The beds and couch were comfortable and the information in your welcome book was helpful. Warm & cozy all around. Jason was always available for any questions. All in all, a great place to enjoy the flavor of North Carolina's mountains."
1904,28,Jason was extremely helpful during this entire visit and the weeks leading up. The space itself is perfect for relaxing after exploring the surrounding areas. Would absolutely visit and stay again
1905,28,Absolutely loved our stay here! So cozy! Highly recommended!!
1906,28,This was a great place to stay for a couple or a couple with a couple of kids who are elementary age and older. I appreciate the cleanliness and the responsiveness of Jason!
1907,28,One of the coziest airbnb's we've ever stayed at. Everything was perfect! Seriously! Everything you need was included! I loved this place so much. There is a creek in the back to listen to and it was so cozy! We had so much fun! Thank you Jason and Issa! Perfect location. Amazing AIRBNB listing! 100 stars 🌟
1908,28,Great place to stay. Just as listing shows.
1909,28,Lovely! Just what we were looking for. Very clean. Adorable. Had a blast!
1910,28,Great layout with quality kitchen equipment and furnishings. Great value for our stay as a couple. Check-in was easy.
1911,28,Jason’s place is amazing! It’s super cute! VERY clean!! Great location!!! Would totally come back!!!
1912,28,"Overall, we loved it. The house was cozy and clean. They had everything we needed.
The trail around the house was very peaceful to walk. The communication with Jason was awesome! Thank you. We even saw a shooting star!
The sound of the creek was plus!

Two things we didn’t expect were we thought the house was totally surrounded by nature but there are a couple houses close by. (One is right next to this house)
And Monday morning was a little noisy with the commercial vehicles and big delivery truck passing by…Weekend might be more quiet:)

But we made a fire and my kids explored nature and we could spend very peaceful night. We needed it. Thank you."
1913,28,This was the perfect Airbnb! Small and cozy but had everything needed for a weekend away in the mountains!
1914,28,"Lovely little stream out back. Clean, cozy, perfect for two people!"
1915,28,"Jason’s little hut should be called Jason’s Gem: really nice, superbly clean with a great deal of attention to details including leaving coffee (forgot to take some from home before leaving, in the mornings, if I don’t have a cup of coffee first, don’t even talk to me..LOL). House is situated in a beautiful surrounding, so peaceful and calm, it was very clean, loved the shower. Will definitely stay again if we come to Boone. BTW Jason, if you ever decide to sell it, let me know please, my wife loved it."
1916,28,"So cute, clean, and comfy. Such a peaceful stay - overlooking trees and stream from the porch. Will definitely plan to stay again!"
1917,28,Cute and comfortable Quonset hut in a great location. Enjoyed relaxing on the patio at the end of the day listening to the creek. I would definitely stay here again.
1918,28,This was a great place! Wonderful… Exactly as described… Cute and quaint and perfect.
1919,28,Awesome little place nestled into the mountains! We loved it and will probably return.
1920,28,Beautiful small home and great location for our family. The kids definitely enjoyed the creek nearby. Will hopefully book future stays with the host at this location or the other properties. Very impressed!
1921,28,"This is a great stay! Very clean, and well stocked with everything you’d need for a vacation from home. Jason also was very good about communicating with me in a timely manner, which was much appreciated."
1922,28,Cozy cabin in the woods. We enjoyed sitting on the back porch and listening to the creek. So relaxing.
1923,28,"Beautiful home, great location!"
1924,28,"A very beautiful place to stay, close to everything. At a fabulous price! Would definitely recommend!"
1925,28,Very cozy. No issues - Jason was easy to contact and frequently responded to any questions we had.
1926,28,Good time in Mountains. Loft might be a bit hot to sleep in but for a couple this was great.
1927,28,"Wonderful, clean, cute, had a lot of extra necessities"
1928,28,They place was amazing.
1929,28,Great experience. Check in and cleanliness were both superb. We will return hopefully soon.
1930,28,"What a gem! Beautifully done tiny hut, it feels so spacious inside! Great location and the river nearby makes it so much better!"
1931,28,"This was our very first stay at an Air bnb so I was a little skeptical at first, but I couldn't have asked for it to go any better! The description was just as listed. Everything was very clean and neat. No complaints!"
1932,28,Omg the cuteness is indescribable! My children and I loved it!! Hoping to go back again soon
1933,28,This adorable tiny house is such a wonderful and cozy stay. Me and two of my friends rented this house out as a bit of a get away we have known each other for 15 years and this Airbnb was the perfect getaway spot!
1934,28,"This place is super quant, relaxing, and full of character!! The atmosphere was amazing! The guy was beautiful on the inside and out!! It was the perfect little place for my daughter and I!!"
1935,28,"An adorable, cozy home. Perfect for a couple. Plenty of privacy with beautiful scenery."
1936,28,"We loved our stay here. The home was comfortable, clean, and thoughtfully decorated. We really loved the little stream off the front porch. And the location was great, only about 15min to Downtown Boone."
1937,28,"Communication was top notch from jason. Place was clean and well kept. Perfect location from boone, west jefferson, and blowing rock. Great stay"
1938,28,"Very cozy, cute place to stay!"
1939,28,"What a wonderful little Airbnb! Very cozy, inviting, and clean. The sound of the rippling creek outside was so peaceful — we loved it! If you’re looking for a cozy, quiet getaway, I would highly recommend staying here. ☺️"
1940,28,Perfect and private! Very cozy! The sound of the creek right outside the front porch is so peaceful!
1941,28,"We’d definitely recommend Jason’s place to friends driving through Boone. It was clean and cozy, we loved sitting outside and listening to the creek. Even the little loft beds were super comfortable."
1942,28,"We really enjoyed our stay! The space was clean, comfortable, and just want we wanted. I would rebook in the future."
1943,28,super cute place!! the hut was easy to find and offered plenty of space for parking. it was such a cozy environment with the little creek out front!! 10/10
1944,28,"We stayed here last year and couldn’t wait to come back! It was such a great stay once again. We love the location and the property, they really have a great little place. We always love looking out for the little bunnies that cross the road as we drive through. Can’t wait to come back again!"
1945,28,"Jason's AirBnB was immaculate and thoughtful. We could tell a lot of care went into every detail. The location is lovely and peaceful. The bed was comfy and the rainfall shower head was a nice surprise after a busy wedding weekend!

One note: We wished there was some indication that the decor had a religious theme. Not being religious, the space didn't feel welcoming to us.

Overall, it's a nice little mountain getaway!"
1946,28,Very peaceful place - would definitely recommend!!!
1947,28,Fantastic place to stay! Very clean and great setup. Place on grounds to hike and play in a creek. Love it!
1948,28,Great stay. Beautiful location.
1949,28,"I normally don't give reviews, but this little cabin deserves a great one!
If you want to have the cabin/tiny house experience in the mountains this is a perfect place. We are a family of 3 and we all loved it! Our son absolutely didn't want to leave, he enjoy the loft space so much. We played games, made food, listened to music, took naps, and had hot showers. There is a little creek that runs right through the entrance on the porch which makes the experience even more pleasant.
AS a germophobic, I do struggle every time I travel. This cabin was clean, and the bathroom and kitchen which are my top 2 areas were very clean. They did a good job covering all the aspects, in terms of supplies and essentials. My favorite things were the hooks, baskets, and dimmer lights all around the house. We were very pleased and will definitely come back in the fall."
1950,28,The hut is a great place to get away to return to nature and ourselves. The bed is great. It is all that it is advertised to be.
1951,28,"This is a nice, cozy and beautiful place for a small family. We liked every bit of it. The appliances are very good. The location, cleanliness and instructions are pretty good. The quietness along with bird chip rings and subtle sound from the creek bring an ultimate serenity. Thank you Jason for hosting in your beautiful hut."
1952,28,"Exactly as described - what a gorgeous setting! We had every thing we needed for our stay to celebrate our daughter’s graduation from App State. The space was flawlessly laid out, the creek right off the porch was so relaxing in sight and sound. Check in was easy, communication with the host was very timely and informative - all the special touches were in place when we arrived! Such a cozy, homey, and comfortable space for my husband and myself, along with my mom and our son. Wouldn’t change a thing!"
1953,28,Very cozy and quiet place. Stream of water just outside the porch. Well equipped house has everything you need. Doesn't get any better than this at this price. Or at any price ? Maybe it does. But you'll never feel like you should've spent more. The host has thought of every little thing.
1954,28,This one is a gem. Although the views and sound of a gurgling stream are mountainous the approach is a very easy on maintained gravel road. The hut's porch is charming and the interior well planned and furnished. Tall people only need to duck at the bathroom pocket doorway. Wifi and cell service were good.
1955,28,This lil place is so cute! It is very clean and well maintained. A lot of thought was put into the design. You will absolutely love it! There is a fire pit and waterfall stream and it is close to Boone! Absolutely wonderful!!
1956,28,Jason’s Quonset Hut was beautiful and he was very accommodating. I highly recommend staying there!
1957,28,"We had a wonderful stay at this cozy little place. It was clean, well furnished and had beautiful surroundings."
1958,28,This place nails it for charm! Sweet little creek greets you from the porch. Everything you might need and super clean too. Highly recommended!
1959,28,"The hut is adorable! It was the perfect size for the two of us. I loved the fact that it’s sitting on the creek. It was clean, organized, and had a well stocked kitchen. They also have games and puzzles as well! Highly recommend!!"
1960,28,very nice tiny home
1961,28,Cute little spot! Pretty close to Boone. Perfect for a couple or a couple friends.
1962,28,"This adorable little hut was awesome for a get-away! It was a little father from downtown Boone than expected. However, the amenities were great— especially the washer and dryer! The place was clean and exactly what we needed. Ceilings are low so beware! There aren’t any blinds or curtains for the front door and there were people walking around the area in front of the hut, so not the most private place."
1963,28,This place is even better and bigger on the inside then it looks from the outside. My two children and I absolutely love the experience especially the loft for the kids. The stream behind the place is wonderful and hiking near the cabin is also wonderful. We will absolutely stay again soon.
1964,28,Perfect little stay in the mountains and very convenient to Boone or Jefferson. Everything was provided and the personal touches made it feel very comfortable. The pictures perfectly represent the little hut. So cozy and clean! We would definitely stay again.
1965,28,"This sweet cabin is so beautiful, clean and located in the sweet spot - feels like we’re secluded surrounded by mountains, streams and Christmas trees and still a quick and easy drive to Boone! The place comes with everything one could ever need! I’ll defiantly be back!"
1966,28,So nice! Looked exactly like the photos. Very clean. Very easy to find. Great instructions. No issues.
1967,28,"This was a cozy spot for 2-4 travelers that was just far enough away from the hustle and bustle of town, but close enough for an easy drive for food and fun. Would definitely recommend this place."
1968,28,Great location and Very cool hut on a creek
1969,28,The cabin was cute and clean.
1970,28,The little hut was a wonderfully functional and comfy space. Loved everything about it for our family of 4. Fun to discover the peace and beauty of Deep Gap.
1971,29,"This was the perfect spring getaway for my husbands birthday. The house was so unique and cozy and the views were unbeatable. Doug & Jen were very responsive and thought of everything. You feel like you’re in the middle of nowhere but still so close to go out and about and have a great meal or hike. We spent most of the time with coffee in hand, just admiring the property. Definitely recommend!"
1972,29,Great location and amazing views around! Amenities in the house could be better in bathroom and kitchen. Overall good stay.
1973,29,"This is such a unique and beautiful cabin. The hosts were above and beyond amazing. The views brought warmth to our hearts and gave us the relaxation we needed. I would highly recommend staying with Doug & Jen. Ps if you are reading this, the mountains are calling. 🥰😍"
1974,29,"You are missing out if you don’t book this place! My husband and I spent this past weekend up here to celebrate our 14th wedding anniversary. It was exactly what we needed to reset. Just enough off the grid to disconnect, but still have the amenities to charge phones and take a shower. We will be coming back every year for our anniversary!"
1975,29,Great place to stay!
1976,29,"This place is so, so, so wonderful! It was spotlessly clean and was even better than the pictures! Plenty of hot water and we loved using all of the fire pits and gas stove. Just what we needed to unwind and recharge for the weekend. The hosts were very friendly and super responsive. We can't stop thinking about how great it was and we can't wait to book again!"
1977,29,Amazing views of the mountains right outside your porch. This cabin is so cozy. The stonework is unbelieveably beautiful.
1978,29,"Super cool spot! The views were amazing and the cabin was so cozy. It was very cold the first night, so we were thankful for the furnace. When our propane went out, the owners were quick to fix it."
1979,29,Beautiful property and cabin to relax and recharge! We had a great time.
1980,29,This place was amazing! It actually rained all Saturday during our stay and we still enjoyed every minute! Perfect experience and will be coming back to stay again!
1981,29,"Amazing Place to get engaged!!

Doug and Jen’s Raven Rock Cabins are one of a kind! An amazing camping-like experience with 360 Mountain Views and the most creative woodworking all over the porch. Overall would highly recommend!!

We stayed mid February with some colder temps at night and the wind was very strong. Definitely recommend additional blankets and socks to stay warm. The only heat source is the wood stove, so I would be tactical on how you keep feeding it throughout the night."
1982,29,This was an amazing place to stay! This entire experience was beyond our expectations! So many wonderful details to the property that made everything so comfortable. We really didn’t want to leave. They were great with communication and made check in and check out very easy. Doug also rescued us when we needed assistance with a car tow at the end of our stay. Thank you!
1983,29,The divide cottage was everything we could’ve wanted! The views are amazing and the place was extremely clean. We will definitely be back!
1984,29,Exactly as it sounds. Great place with all the peacefulness you need. Amazing sunrise and sunsets.
1985,29,"We stayed for our anniversary and it was everything we needed. Peace, quiet, beautiful surroundings, and a disconnect from the busy world we live in. We hope to come back and stay in one of their other 2 properties."
1986,29,"Amazing views, cozy feel and much more than we expected. So nice we decided to stay another night through a rain storm."
1987,29,"Doug and Jen were amazing hosts and their off grid cabin was stunning. They made us feel at home and even started us a fire at the community space for Christmas Eve. It was a pleasure meeting them. We are still so impressed by the craftsmanship and design of the Airbnb. It was glamping at its finest. We LOVED the wood stove. The views were incredible, especially at sunrise. Even though there are other airbnbs at the top of the mountain, you are completely secluded. We want to stay in all of them! We have told all our friends and some have already booked this space! You’ll want to as well! This is an Airbnb we will continue to stay at as long as they will have us!"
1988,29,Beautiful spot.
1989,29,"This cabin is on top of a private mountain with absolutely stunning views. Jenn is so sweet and responds quickly if you have any questions/concerns. We thought we had 4wd but shortly before leaving found out our SUV was 2wd so she took us up and down a few times when we really needed it. She did not lie when she says the hike is brutal. It’s very steep So I recommend making sure you have AWD or 4WD before booking. Also I recommend bringing your own pots/pans and a lighter if you intend to make breakfast. I wish we would have booked this before it was freezing outside because the wind gets up to around 60 mph and it was about 20 degrees at night and with only the wood stove you have to constantly wake up to keep it going. Even with this it was a romantic, spontaneous very off grid experience and we will deff stay here again during the fall/spring when we have a new truck!"
1990,29,The Divide Cottage was absolutely amazing and stunning place only to be experienced if you don't hesitate and just go. Everything from the pictures and description on what to bring were spot on. The reviews were also very helpful on what you may want to bring extra that will enhance your stay. I will definitely be booking again in the future.
1991,29,"We booked this cabin for our honeymoon and it served us wonderfully as we didn’t have distractions the whole time we were there. If you’re looking for a romantic place to relax and take in the beautiful views, this is definitely a great place.
It has just enough of the necessities that you need. We loved sitting by the fire at night and enjoying the peace and quiet."
1992,29,"STAY HERE when you are in the Asheville Area! Doug and Jen had great communication! I can’t stress enough how pretty this spot is! Look just like the pictures! This was a wonderful cozy spot! Nothing is more amazing than waking up with the sunrise and going to bed with the sunset! The location is very easy to find and not too far from good restaurants! Understand, you NEED All Wheel or 4 wheel drive. For someone who loves to hike that hike up to the cabin is not the hike you want to do. So plan accordingly, for the best experience! They had this book in the cabin called “A Touch of Wonder”, it was an amazing read for the stay, I also order the book online! Very happy with my stay."
1993,29,Love the cozy outdoorsy feeling!
1994,29,Very kind hosts... they provided plenty of firewood for our multi-night stay. The cabin was perfect for our preferences - remote and quaint. Thank you!
1995,29,"Fantastic time. Beautiful inside and out. Relaxing. Quiet. Quickly get to grocery, restaurants, and shopping if needed."
1996,29,"My husband and I were looking for an off-grid experience for our anniversary and this little cottage was perfect! We loved the views from both porches and keeping warm by the fires.

The only downside was that the other 2 rental units are located fairly close to the cottage. Not close enough to see in or around just within walking distance, which we did not expect. This didn't take anything away from our experience as the other units were not very busy during our stay.

Overall, we loved it and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a different experience."
1997,29,"The cabin was truly a magnificent experience. It was quaint and cozy, and the views were incredible. The owners took care to check on us, and they were extremely friendly. We chose this spot as a 25th wedding anniversary getaway. It is definitely a place we would visit again."
1998,29,Breathtaking sunrises! It was a beautiful location but still very accessible to grocery stores/town. We will definitely stay again if we are in the area!
1999,29,This was one of the most spectacular locales I've visited and restorative trips I've experienced. The Divide at Raven's Rock was incredible. Doug and Jen are top-notch hosts and the space is everything we wanted. I have to highly rate and recommend this place even if I selfishly want to keep it a secret.
2000,29,"We stayed in the Divide Cottage 11/04/22-11/06/22 and LOVED every minute of it! This cabin and the surrounding setting are absolutely gorgeous. No lie about how steep the road leading to the cabin is, but our 4-wheel drive truck had no problems. Doug and Jen are the best hosts I have ever dealt with, they will answer all of your questions immediately. We brought our own food so we would not have to eat out. Our first night was perfect weather wise, and we grilled steaks and baked potatoes on the charcoal grill (we brought our own charcoal). We built a fire in the huge fire pit outside by the outdoor kitchen and ate outside at the bar. We then had a glass of wine while sitting on the bench by the fire pit. We both had plenty of hot water for our showers Friday night and had no issues with making our way out to the bathroom in the middle of the night, as the outdoor kitchen area was lit up with solar lights. We did take a very bright lantern to use also which came in very handy later. The rain set in late Friday night, and it rained non-stop all-day Saturday which we did not mind because we were prepared. We got up Saturday morning and made pancakes on the griddle that we brought from home, bacon and eggs and had fresh coffee. We brought our own camping coffee percolator (that sits on the burner) because we do not care for the French Press style that is provided at the cabin. We skipped lunch and used our large soup pot that we also brought from home to make our favorite soup in, and we had that for supper while sitting inside by the fire in the wood stove while watching it rain. Because we did not want to miss the TN & GA football game Saturday, we brought our small portable generator, TV and digital antenna from home, set it up and it worked perfectly so that we could watch the game. We had a perfect rainy Saturday. When we got up Sunday morning, I was somewhat glad that we were leaving ONLY because it had rained and stayed super cloudy for so long that it drained all the solar power. The bedroom light, bathroom light, refrigerator, and hot water were all gone on Sunday morning before we left, but that was to be expected considering it truly is “off the grid” power. If you know this and understand this, it should not bother you. Just plan ahead like we did and take a few extra things from home to make your stay that much more comfortable. There are plenty of dishes & utensils for two people, there is a 10-gallon container of fresh drinking water, the refrigerator and small freezer holds a lot of food, there is a French press coffee maker, and the bed is amazingly comfortable. There was also plenty of toilet paper and paper towels supplied, a wine bottle opener and two coffee mugs. No other cups are provided.
These are the things that we brought with us that came in very handy for our stay. Queen sheets & pillowcases – MUST take, bath towels, wash cloths, soap & all other toiletries that you use – MUST take, Charcoal, lighter fluid, butane lighter, tongs, steak knives – only if planning on using the grill. Extras we brought from home that we are glad we took: Small portable generator, long extension cord & small TV. Extra old towels that we ended up using on the bathroom floor to keep it dry. Wood for the outdoor fire pit, food for all our meals, paper plates, extra paper towels, bottled water, wine & shatterproof wine glasses, they do have a wine bottle opener but we took our own just in case, a griddle to use over the 2-burners for pancakes, a large soup pot & ladle, coffee percolator, a bright lantern to use while going to the bathroom at night, then needed it for inside the cabin after the large overhead inside light lost power. Just plan ahead, and you should without a doubt enjoy your stay as much as we did. We are looking forward to staying at the Divide Cabin again very soon! This place is a rare gem! Doug & Jen are awesome!"
2001,29,"This was an incredible stay. Great communication with the hosts. Enough firewood provided to get started and to keep the stove going throughout the night! Can’t say enough about the location and all the details of the cabin, which were all great!"
2002,29,"Amazing stay, incredible property! The best place for some rest and relaxation."
2003,29,"Absolutely breathtaking, such a phenomenal place, great engineering, and this place will bring you closest to heaven as one can get.

Night-time star gazing extravaganza is amazing, a great place for those ladies who want a little bit of Glamping. Guest must provide their own towels/linens, blankets, or sleeping bags, and flashlights. Cabin is on a power grid, kitchenette powered by propane tanks, no plugs, but there are USB plug-ins for your cell phones, great cell service/Wi-Fi —FYI…

There is a separate private bathroom off of the outside kitchen, hot shower accommodated by generator. (watch your step, step down before entering bathroom off platform).

So many thoughtful touches like fresh drinking water, wood for indoor fireplace and outdoor fire pits provided by the host.

Such a fantastic place, if you want to unplug from today’s world and just sit in peace with nature?

This is your place."
2004,29,Amazing view and a great break away from the world for some much needed R&R. Still close enough to Asheville as to not be inconvenient.
2005,29,We enjoyed our stay! It was chilly at night but the wood stove worked well and the sunrise and sunset were beautiful.
2006,29,Best hosts we’ve ever had!! Doug & Jen are incredibly kind and accommodating. Everything about this cozy cabin and property is so beautiful and definitely our favorite place we’ve ever stayed in the Asheville area.
2007,29,"Amazing hideaway. This cottage was great, and the views were amazing. Definitely will be back in the future."
2008,29,"We only knew what we read on other reviews, but what we didn't expect, was to be blown away when we arrived at the top of the
mountain and to see such an incredible, peaceful and serene spot at The Divide ! Our children surprised us with a small getaway and it was perfect !! I felt close to Heaven itself, surrounded by endless stars and such peaceful evenings. This trip was a nice change from our current hustle and bustle schedules to a time of reconnecting with each other, no distractions. The bed was comfortable and the entire cabin was decorated in rustic and western theme and so fun ! I did bring an extra comforter bc I get cold at night. There were many logs provided for indoor and outdoor use, we picked up some extras from Ingles. The indoor fire made kept us warm all night. We made breakfast outside each morning, it was perfect and accommodating with cast iron skillet and utensils; and I never used a French press before but I have already purchased for my coffee here at home. The Hosts, Doug and Jen, checked in with us daily and we were grateful. I started the trip apprehensive of seeing a wild animal and when it was time to checkout, we were so well rested; we did not want to leave......it was breathtaking, and beautiful, and the most relaxing (well deserved) trip we've taken in a long time. We cannot wait to return again. Thank you for sharing your piece of Heaven with all of us, we are incredibly grateful and look forward to returning again. Sincerely, audra & george

P.S.... it was recommended to read page 179, the deadly art of nonliving; I am so grateful you shared with us, it truly was momentous for us !"
2009,29,Great experience and beautiful cabin! Amazing location and I highly recommend!!!
2010,29,Complications.
2011,29,"These are the people who find a bandaid in their salads every time they eat out.


Slammers"
2012,29,"This was our second stay (first was in May) and it was just as dreamy as the first time. However this time nights were a lot cooler, which we enjoyed 🙂 don’t think about it, just book it! You will be close to a million things to see and do! Chimney Rock, Asheville, only 1.5 hours from GSMNP…list goes on. Doug and Jen checked in to make sure we had everything we needed, but also gave us space to enjoy our vacation. I’m sure we will be back!"
2013,29,"My fiance and I stayed in the Divide Cottage from a Sunday to a Saturday. When we arrived we were absolutely blown away by the house, views and serenity of it all. The pictures themselves were stunning but seeing it all in person was more then we would have ever expected! We really didn't want to leave. The cottage itself is the most beautiful architecture, we caught ourselves just looking at it in awe multiple times throughout our trip. Everything was kept extremely clean and we had everything we needed! The property was breath taking with views at every angle! Doug and Jen were the absolute BEST hosts you could have! Checking in just enough and giving space to enjoy our trip, they were so quick to respond if we had a question and just SO nice! ""Disconnect to Reconnect"" is their slogan and they have created the perfect most peaceful spot to do just that! We had hikes and things planned every day, BUT after arriving to the house we ended up spending the majority of our time there! You wont want to leave! This place has grown a huge spot in our hearts and we will 1 million percent be returning and cant wait! Thank you Doug and Jen!!!"
2014,29,We had a great couple of days in the cottage! The weather was amazing and the mountain views were great! We had a couple of questions and we were able to get everything figured out so quickly with the help of Doug! We hope to be able to come back and visit again soon.
2015,29,Thank you! Wife and I had a great weekend.
2016,29,"This location is so beautiful!
The cabin had everything we needed.
It will bring you back to nature, enjoy a fire roast some marshmallows and enjoy the peace and quiet.
Very comfortable bed too."
2017,29,"We stayed at the other two airbnbs on this property: the cabin and the treehouse, and were excited to try the more luxurious cabin with running water, and a bathroom.
You have a great 360 view when you’re laying in bed. We even saw a bobcat from the safety of our cabin one night !
There is several places where you can have a cozy fire, and enjoy your time in the mountains"
2018,29,We enjoyed our stay.
2019,29,"If your looking for a place to unwind and enjoy, this is it! Doug and Jenn couldn’t have designed this place any better! We loved our stay and hope to come back again."
2020,29,This was the best cabin we've ever stayed in. It's like having your bedroom at the top of the mountain with beautiful views on multiple sides. The amenities were perfect and we were able to cook an amazing steak and scallop dinner the first night and enjoy the sunset over the mountains. The location is perfect and just a short ride to downtown Hendersonville and a quick 4-minute ride to our favorite NC winery (Stone Ashe). The peace we experienced staying here was refreshing and magical. I can't recommend this place enough.
2021,29,"We had an outstanding time on this spectacular property. After many years of camping, backpacking, and hosteling, the Divide Cottage is the best indoor/outdoor combination that we’ve ever experienced. Thank you, Doug & Jen for providing such a unique, creative, and well thought out cabin!!"
2022,29,Great place to stay! enjoyed my time!
2023,29,Had an amazing weekend staying at this beautiful property. Can’t wait to come back!!
2024,29,Another amazing stay at one of Doug and Jen’s cabins! Thank you for a tranquil retreat - it was exactly what we needed! We hope to visit again soon!
2025,29,"Doug and Jen have built one of the most amazing properties we’ve ever been to. Our vacation and stay was a dream! We found an absolute gem of a place! Not only were the grounds well manicured and the views incredibly breathtaking on the property, but the Divide Cottage itself was pristine, quaint, welcoming,and peaceful! This property was everything we asked for and more!!!"
2026,29,"If you’ve read the other reviews, not much else to say but the place is amazing and the owners are wonderful!"
2027,29,"Cabin like no other! Incredible views! Quiet, unique and so worth it! Star gazing is brilliant. Not far drive from town. Loved our two night stay!"
2028,29,"This place is incredible. We had such a great time in this unique cabin. We loved the views, enjoyed the simplicity of the space, and our dog was in heaven. We will definitively be back!"
2029,29,"This was the perfect place to unwind and disconnect while we were in the area for a week long event. There were hardly any bugs so the open doors afforded us a spectacular breeze. A hummingbird even buzzed in to say hello. You absolutely must have 4x4 or AWD to get up the hill. It is super steep and you don’t want to mess around with that. We ate out most of the time, but cooked breakfast every morning in the outdoor kitchen. There’s not a lot of storage space for food to keep it separated from critters, so unless you bring coolers or extra zippered bags or totes, don’t overdo the shopping. The shower was awesome (and high 90 degree weather, so it was appreciated). The owners are currently building a structure nearby, so be prepared for some construction noise if you’re there during the day, but they were very respectful of our space and privacy. Such a cool and unique property. Doug and Jenn created a must see it to believe it experience!"
2030,29,Thank you to Doug & Jen for a beautiful & cozy stay! The pictures look just as amazing as the real thing if not better in person!!! We had a lot of fun and wish we stayed longer. This was perfect spot for a secluded stay with a beautiful view. We loved it!
2031,29,"Do not hesitate to book your stay at the Divide Cottage. My boyfriend and I will not forget our stay here anytime soon. I was worried about being hot at night since we were staying in mid July but we did not have an issue. If you have the chance, go experience this beautiful cottage."
2032,29,Doug and Jen gave us a great rustic experience. They communicated with us via the air bnb app several times during the visit to check in. The cabin was clean and orderly as were the bathroom and cook area. Great place to stay if you are looking to unplug
2033,29,"This place is so enchanting! The incredible views and the sounds of nature at night or as you awake — It doesn’t get more serene!

Our dog was in her personal heaven, and we were, too!

I didn’t realize when I booked that we would have to bring our own sheets, towels, etc — but we drove so this wasn’t a problem at all (it is just a heads up for folks thinking of flying!).

There are a few other spots on the property, but you’re totally secluded in this cottage — and it’s so cool to see what they’ve done with the land and hear about their future plans. Awesome opportunity to disconnect from the web/world and reconnect to each other.

Honestly, it’s stunning. Go here!"
2034,29,"This place is an amazing getaway. Rustic and beautiful. This stay is definitely for those who want to be out in nature but with amenities. The cabin has plenty of drinking water, kitchen appliances (mini fridge, propane stove, pots and pans, water boiler, dish soap, paper towels, utensils for eating and cooking), a cozy bed (pillows and quilt, but no sheets) and even some USB outlets for charging phones (No wall outlets though). There is only one main light in the chandelier of the cabin and some solar powered floor lights outside, so I would recommend brining either flashlights or lanterns. There is enough firewood, kindling, tinder and lighters/matches included for about two nights, (additional firewood for purchase if needed). The bathroom is amazing and appears to be built into the hillside right next to the kitchen. It is indoors with a full sink (Running water), toilet (with toilet paper) and spacious shower (bring towels). The bug situation was minimal, especially in 85 degree weather. Light bug spray should keep you comfortable. There are plenty of doors and windows for ventilation but they all can be sealed very nicely during wind and rain. There is service once you get to the cabin but there is no service on the road to the property so be prepared for that if using a GPS. Ultimately we had no complaints about the entire stay and actually changed our plans of going out to the town just so we had more time to stay in the space. If you're looking to disconnect for a bit and enjoy the outdoors and the views, do not hesitate to book!"
2035,29,"The Divide Cottage was on my Bucket List. This cabin is perfect. Its 5 steps above Glamping. with a shower and toilet attached. the view, the breeze, the smell, everything was perfect. there is fire wood, 2 fire pits, we cooked breakfast on the outside stove. no bugs. sleeping was incredible. the owners were so kind. everything runs on solar. I made a video of the cabin you can find it on TikTok @tabblessed. it's incredible."
2036,29,"A beautiful place to stay. I can’t say enough over how amazing our stay was. The cabin was clean and well stocked with everything you could need for your stay. We spent our evenings at the 2 fire pits. No matter where you were in the cabin, you had an amazing view. We were only 25-30 minutes from downtown Asheville. A great place for a great weekend"
2037,29,"Everything about our stay was better than expected. The cabin is solid and you feel protected from the elements, especially the wind, and you are in nature the whole time. The fire pits are amazingly huge and well placed for sunset or sunrise viewing. Doug and Jen are very considerate hosts, they were ready to take us up to the cottage when we arrived(4 wheel or all wheel drive is definately mandatory) and checked in on us throughout our stay. We cooked on the stove every day which was a nice 2 burner propane camping stove, they had all the utensils and pans 2 people would need. One tip is to keep the dish rack in the bathroom to dry dishes-it saves going in and out of bathroom. we took our telescope and were able to see many planets up close. We saw the local resident bear who lumbered past, not at all interested in us, looking for dead trees to rummage and we saw a beautiful Indigo bunting male bird that was iridescent blue. We hiked the suggested hikes around Bear Wallow and they were very nice, shared a nice tasting at the Souther-Williams winery and ""got strainge"" at Sierra Nevada Brewery. Overall a much needed and relaxing time for 2. Highly recommended!"
2038,29,everything about the stay was perfect! i really love the seclusiveness but still easily accessible to town!
2039,29,Loved this place! It was so quiet and remote. We absolutely loved it and will definitely be back to stay again.
2040,29,"Beautiful cabin. The work that has gone into building and designing this cabin was beyond our expectations. The views of the mountains all around you, the gorgeous sunsets every evening made us not want to leave. Doug and Jen are very quick to answer any questions that you may have. We will definitely be going back to stay again!"
2041,29,"This Mountaintop Gem was well stocked with everything We needed! A Beautiful view, pet friendly!!!!!, our dogs were living their best life up there! We enjoyed exploring the area, weekend farmers market in town, breweries, distillery, and a few killer eats too! Watch the sunset from the cabins western facing firepit, or the sunrise on the east side deck with a coffee and your sweetheart! Don’t miss hitting up a few local hikes either!!"
2042,29,the stay was absolutely amazing! We could not have asked for a better stay with amazing views & unforgettable memories! doug & jen were also very quick to reply with any questions that we had 😊
2043,29,"My favorite Airbnb I’ve ever found. It was exactly what we were looking for: secluded, great views, solar-powered, comfortable, thoughtful architecture. Jen was very friendly and helped us shuttle our stuff to the cabin. We didn’t get to meet Doug but very much admired his vision and skill in designing and building this magical place. We will be back soon!"
2044,29,This cabin is amazingly unique. From the over a ton stone bench and huge iron fire pits to the excellent carpentry and craftsmanship of the cabin you won’t be disappointed. Outside kitchen suited all our needs. Multiple outside seating and the bathroom was super clean and tiled well. Smelled great! Had adequate space to set out toiletries and great lighting. The interior glass garage door opening up cabin to fresh air and more outside viewing is a special touch. A truly unique place. And no one will bother you. Lots of privacy.
2045,29,"We are on our way home, about an hour away from PA and have post Divide Cottage blues. If you are second guessing booking, don’t. It is better than we could have imagined. Clean. Remote. And the views are insane! Doug and Jen checked in with us each day but also allowed us to have our space. And you’ll have plenty of it! While this cottage is technically off the grid, it still provides necessities such as a bathroom which was outside. Only a short distance from the cabin door. We loved the outdoor kitchen and deck that wraps around 3/4 of the cabin. Sunsets are awesome. It was lovely even during the storms that we got…we are already talking about going back!"
2046,29,"Off grid: check
Picture perfect mountain views: check
Inspiring sunsets: check
Comfortable: check
Satisfied: beyond.

I’ve come to this special place several different times and for the same reason, to practice the art of living. A place to just be, all while getting lost in the depths of the bonfire’s dancing flames. This visit, I brought friends and introduced them to the magic. They were so impressed that they’re committed to coming back with their significant others.

I’m grateful for Raven Rock Mountain. The energy invites me to relax as I take respite from the normal routine that often seems to be so busy. We were fortunate enough to share some bonfires with the hosts and greatly enjoyed their stories and vibe. I will be back again and again. Thank you Raven Rock."
2047,29,"The cabin is very cool 😎. Doug &Jen have created a comfy spot with tons of stone everywhere outside. A walk runs between east and west facing patios. Each side also has a fire pit, the east side being a huge affair with a long stone ""bench"" and stone pavers all around.

Only indoor space is the bedroom, and an attached bathroom at the side/end thru the kitchen area. The bedroom can be opened up on three sides with windows and an all glass garage door facing west. The winds seem to keep most insects at bay, except during calm daytime hours.

Lucky for us we witnessed the super full moon eclipse, and with mostly complete sky views, it was beautiful, no light pollution. The kitchen is very basic and did have some utensils, a smallish fridge with a freezer, a built into the rock charcoal grill, and 2 propane stove burners. We chose to stay put, relax, cook our meals and talk.

Doug & Jen responded quickly to our questions, and provided a much needed respite from daily life with this bare bones (no electric outlets) cabin that is richly beautiful with decor. Let them know your questions and ideas, they'll help fully prepare you."
2048,29,"A wonderful stay, don’t hesitate to book!! Definitely need front wheel or all wheel drive. Bring your own coffee grounds if you want coffee & charcoal for grill!"
2049,30,"This was the perfect spot for a weekend getaway for me and my dog! Not only was it just really cool to stay in a converted shipping container, but it was a really comfortable space and within walking distance to the ocean. Shelly had given me some great recommendations for restaurants ahead of time, which is always welcome. I would definitely recommend staying here if you’re looking for a nice getaway!"
2050,30,we had a great time
2051,30,This spot is great and I would stay there again the only thing that was a bit annoying was the technical issues with the TV. It would almost appear to short out so nothing could be played and a phone wouldn’t connect via Bluetooth for music. Wasn’t a huge deal as most of the time was outdoors.
2052,30,Perfect time away from home. Loved our time in this unique home and beautiful area.
2053,30,"What a unique visit! Shelly was more than an accommodating host as Hurricane Ian forced us to reschedule last Fall. The shipping container was absolutely perfect! Staged and stocked as a contemporary stay, sparkling clean, and easy key system. Shelly was generous to share local tips and secrets as we were unfamiliar with the area. Perfect accommodation for any couple looking for an eccentric get away!"
2054,30,"Shelly was an excellent host, we will be coming back!"
2055,30,Very cute and cozy spot! Hidden off the main streets but easy quick drive or walk to local spots
2056,30,My second time staying at this place and it was just as peaceful as I remembered. Great location! My go to place if I am not staying with a large group and want to be within walking distance to the beach. Parking and outside decks are a plus.
2057,30,"My husband and I loved this container home by the beach. It was very clean and safe, more spacious than we were expecting on the inside! Very comfortable bed as well. My tips for staying here is to remember things like hand towels & pillow cases as they are not provided. Also extra blankets for the bed and watching Tv on the couch. Overall great stay!"
2058,30,"The space was bigger than I imagined. Very excited to stay in a container home’s unique layout. Comfortable bed and sofa, loved the porches and looking forward to coming another visit."
2059,30,"Great weekend getaway for a couple, short walk to beaches and dining. Microwave would have been a bonus but the toaster oven filled in well. Exactly as described, great weekend!"
2060,30,"This is my second time staying in this marvelous beach container. It is cozy, well-designed and a 5 minute walk from the beach. The outside deck extends the space into lovely, natural landscaping on this wonderful corner lot. I look forward to a return visit."
2061,30,"Clean space, Cute decor & Good communication.
Responded swiftly anytime i needed help or had questions."
2062,30,Great place to try out! Walking distance to the beach. Nice spots to eat!
2063,30,"I’ve always wanted to experience a shipping container house, and Shelly’s was a really great option. It was efficiently designed, thoughtfully equipped and tastefully decorated. The bathroom was surprisingly big and kitchen had all the necessities. I loved the outdoor decks and the neighborhood was quiet and walkable. Only 300 steps from the beach which I walked almost daily. A short to experience the beautiful sunrises! If you are in Carolina Beach, I’d highly recommend Shelly’s lovely place. She is a terrific host, great with communication and super easy to work with."
2064,30,"My first time staying in a shipping container was better than I expected! The location was perfect, very quiet neighborhood and a 2 minute walk to the beach. Check-in was perfect, just entered a code and walked right in, the host was responsive and left us alone which was perfect. The interior was very clean and spacious, pretty much spotless.

The living room had a Roku TV with all the good stuff. 10/10 would recommend and stay again!!!"
2065,30,We absolutely loved staying! 10/10
2066,30,"Pros:
Overall, my fiancé and I enjoyed our two night stay here. The location is ideal (a short walk to the beach is always a plus) and there's plenty to explore in the area. A nice, quiet neighborhood with some natural plant barriers to keep you secluded - even if you're sitting outside, which we did a good bit.

Not-so-pros:
One of the outdoor chairs was damaged (the colored rope one) and needs to be replaced.
There's only one hook inside and without much floor space, floating shelves and/or wall hooks would help a lot. Although we travelled light, we could've used a spot to sit stuff that wasn't the bed, couch, or floor.
The comforter felt dirty and you will not want to use that puppy. Bring a blanket to go over your sheets!
A bit of mold on the shower curtain.

It's very minimal and I really like the concept. Just needs a few tweaks to be great, imo."
2067,30,"My girlfriend and I really enjoyed our stay in this unique shipping container home. The house was well kept, clean, and in a great location only a few blocks from the beach and great restaurants. We would definitely recommend this stay to others!"
2068,30,A great third stay at the containers. Always a blast. Infant/pup friendly
2069,30,"Had a great stay here despite the rainy, cold weather :) stayed here on our way to visit family and it was unique and in a great neighborhood. Shelly was friendly, responsive, and flexible with check in and check out which was appreciated. Felt safe and right at home :)"
2070,30,five star stay so close to the beach beautiful location
2071,30,"very nice adventure. furnishing simple but designed for small thin people..lol
wouldve liked microwave and at least queen bed. chairs were really small and not that functionable. we brought camping chairs. overall good experience to try something new"
2072,30,perfect
2073,30,"Loved our stay in the container home airbnb
Decks were perfect and the home is in a lovely setting under pine trees
Would stay again"
2074,30,This was a Gorgeous Airbnb and the location near the beach was great. Absolutely would come back here and recommend.
2075,30,Another great stay!
2076,30,"Great communication, location and place was as described."
2077,30,Finally got a chance to experience container living. Great location to walk to downtown Carolina Beach and only a couple blocks from the beach. Shelly was great with communication.
2078,30,"This was the perfect little getaway. Its cozy & comfortable. The location is perfect, great restaurants and beach access within minutes! 10/10 would recommend!"
2079,30,Everything was great. The place is super cute and host is friendly. The only problem is the place didn’t seem very clean.
2080,30,The location and easy access to the container was so great. It is located in a more low key spot which I liked. If you’re looking for a busier spot with more amenities I recommend staying closer to the pier.
2081,30,Had a wonderful stay!
2082,30,"Very close to the beach front, local restaurants, and enjoyable vibe."
2083,30,The stay was great! The location was really close to the beach and shops.
2084,30,This is a great space and you absolutely can’t beat the location. We loved it!
2085,30,"Beautiful property, very clean, and great location! Such a unique stay."
2086,30,Great getaway!! Can’t go wrong and Shelly Is absolutely so accommodating. We will be back and hope to stay longer next time. What a fun experience!!
2087,30,We loved this container home and will definitely stay here again. It's just a couple blocks away from the beach and within walking distance of many places.
2088,30,We loved our stay here!! Shelly was such a helpful host. She was quick to respond to any questions and kind to send recommendations for local spots to check out. The space has everything you need - just bring your towels + sheets! We loved walking around the neighborhood and being in such close proximity to the beach. Highly recommend this tiny home!!
2089,30,"This was a great, super unique little place for us to stay. Very comfortable, clean, and so close to the beach. I would definitely recommend it to others."
2090,30,"Great little place with easy beach access, makes a trip much easier."
2091,30,"Great location and it had everything we needed. Hopefully in the future we can stay again, would definitely recommend"
2092,30,"This place is in a perfect location. Each day I was there I was able to swim multiple times at the beach, walk home, rest, and repeat. The outdoor shower is prime, too! Shelly communicated really well and consistently through the whole process. This would be a good place to book both containers to have a fun, beach hangout with other friends and family."
2093,30,Great stay!
2094,30,"Such a cute place! Clean, tidy, pretty much everything you need. Walk to the beach was wicked short and convenient. Will return again!"
2095,30,"Great location, very clean and Shelly had great recommendations on places to eat. We will be back!"
2096,30,Such a cute place! Definitely would recommend for anyone wanting to be close to the beach :)
2097,30,Awesome stay! Highly recommend
2098,30,Awesome experience! Definitely will be coming back!
2099,30,Shelly has a beautiful modern container home. Perfect for 1-2 people. I recommend to anyone wanting a minimalist space!
2100,30,Loved this space so much ! It was perfect for the birthday getaway. Can’t wait to go back !!
2101,30,"Perfect for a short stay. I think they could start providing sheets by now. Not many little perks laying around.
Wonderful location! Clean and simple modular home. Total beach life. Would definitely stay again. Shelly was very receptive."
2102,30,We had a fun stay on our trip and the location was great. Would recommend to anyone looking to stay in the area.
2103,30,Shelly was a great host & the container home was an even better than we expected!
2104,30,"Me and boyfriend loved staying here! It was a close walk to the beach as well as restaurants. Perfect for a couple, small family, or just one person! We will be going back."
2105,30,"As advertised! The place is absolutely made for a couples get away. We caught several people taking pics of the container. Well taken care of n clean. Make sure you bring some bugspray or ""off candles"" if u plan to sit out on the deck. If u like simple and subtle this is your place."
2106,30,"Great location. Awesome experience staying in a shipping container home. The place was updated and clean. The only thing I’d recommend is bringing your own pillows. The ones in the house were too soft for me. 😉
What a problem to have right? Lol"
2107,30,"Everything was clean and as advertised online. It’s a short walk to the beach, and the house is located in a quiet neighborhood."
2108,30,"We enjoyed our stay! Great location and responsive hosts

Trust the owner when they say pack light. No dressers or drawers so heed her suggestion!"
2109,30,I love these pods for their simplicity and modernness! Uncluttered. They’ve got everything you need and nothing you don’t! I think my favorite thing is the lot these are on. There is lots of yard and privacy with beautiful squiggly beach trees dappling the perimeter. The outdoor shower and large deck make the space feel even bigger. Love them!
2110,30,Great location to the beach and just the right size for a couple!
2111,30,the location was great and shelly was a great host. if you need anything she is super responsive!
2112,30,A very unique stay within walking distance to the beach! It was perfect for what my partner and I wanted. Walking back from the beach to an outdoor shower was amazing! Shelly is very communicative and a great host
2113,30,"Our family of three had a fantastic time! Loved the proximity to the public beach access, restaurants and amenities around town. The style of this tiny home is so fun and inviting, and the outdoor shower was absolutely clutch after enjoying a beach day. We sipped coffee on the deck each morning and caught a movie on the couch to wind down in the evening. A great beach getaway!"
2114,30,This was an awesome stay and super close to the beach. Unique stay and Shelly was easy to communicate with. Would definitely recommend if you’re looking for a minimalist beach stay.
2115,30,This container house looked just like the pictures and was very clean. We had a slight problem during our stay and Shelly was quick to respond and correct the problem. My husband and I stayed there for a week during our summer vacation with our 2 dogs. It’s a very nice neighborhood and we were able to walk our dogs daily and felt very safe. It is small but it was all we needed since we are use to camping. We felt like we had extra room compared to our small travel trailer that we camp in.
2116,30,"Perfect for a weekend at the beach! The place is clean, comfortable and about 2 min from the beach."
2117,30,"We really enjoyed our stay at this cute container home!! It was clean, a very easy stroll to the beach, and had everything we needed!! Perfect for a couple’s beach getaway! The side porches were awesome for sitting outside in the evenings and the outdoor shower was so nice after coming in from a day on the beach. Such a great stay!!"
2118,30,This place was absolutely perfect! It was a short walk to the beach and a lot of restaurants! Would love to come back!
2119,30,"Very cool spot, beautiful property with lovely trees and outdoor shower. Great location!"
2120,30,Me and my boyfriend had a last minute stay and we loved our stay. Could use minor updates but perfect nonetheless
2121,30,"The space you see in the listing is exactly what you get. We were looking for a unique place to stay besides your typical hotel or house, and this fits the bill. It's minimalist features and modern feel were perfect for our needs, and within easy walking distance from the beach!"
2122,30,We loved our stay!
2123,30,Shelly’s place was great! It was supper close to the beach and walking distance from some awesome dinning places. The patio space is also very nice and relaxing. The place is perfect for a short stay for 2 people.
2124,30,This airbnb was perfect for our last minute trip to Carolina Beach. It was in a great neighborhood and super cozy. Will definitely be back!
2125,30,Great place to stay. Beautiful container home in and out . Well laid out and roomier than you’d think. Really close to the beach and in a quieter part of the Carolina Beach . Very highly recommend
2126,30,Great place just a few blocks from the beach!
2127,30,"We absolutely loved our stay here! Perfect for a couple and walking distance to the beach. We even walked down to the farmers market and the Carolina Beach pier as well. Awesome locations, such a cute place and everything you need. Would definitely stay again!"
2128,30,"5 star ⭐️ perfect location. Lots of walking around roads that are perfect to walk your pets, or ride your bikes!! Location was not far at all from the beach and your also so close to restaurants and other amenities!! Place was super clean and so cute!! Definitely going to try and book again for our trip next year! :)"
2129,30,This is our second time staying in the container home and we cannot recommend it enough! It is perfect for a weekend getaway! :)
2130,30,"So I’ll get right into it:
Pros -
5 min walk to beach
Great location overall
Overall great communication with host
Outdoor shower is perfect
Super cute and modern
Relatively clean

Con -
The comforter and pillows provided were super grungy and covered very visibly in hair both human and pet.
No closet
Very dusty

Overall is a unique and fun option for one or two nights but just frustrating having to bring all your own linens. Also don’t walk barefoot in the grass there are thorn things everywhere. Don’t forget your pillowcases"
2131,30,"Great place to stay at CB. Simple, comfortable, and close to the beach. Awesome outside shower, dog friendly, and really great host! Highly recommend"
2132,30,This is a great place to stay! The location is perfect since it is walking distance to many different restaurants and the public beach access. The place itself was very clean and comfortable. Shelly is a wonderful host and gave us a ton of suggestions for food and activities. We will definitely be back!
2133,30,"Great location minutes walk from the beach and restaurants. Quiet -while we were there off season. Small, but functional and cute. Good for a couple with a pup."
2134,30,My husband and I had a great time here. The location is super close to the beach and in a very quiet and peaceful neighborhood. The home was clean and perfectly stocked with everything we needed and nothing we didn’t. The bed was very comfortable and the living space was functional and cute. Would definitely stay here again.
2135,30,"Very fun and neat experience to stay in such a unique place. The location is perfect, lots of privacy and the large outdoor space is really nice. It was my husband , myself, teenage son ( who loves tiny houses) and small dog. We had plenty of space. Everything we needed and nothing we didn’t. Shelly was an excellent host. Very efficient and fast communication!"
2136,30,"A few of the major lights in the place needed the bulbs replaced. We found a few big bugs in the place during the night. Under the bed was pretty filthy, layers of dust and other items left by past guests. Other than that place was cute and nice. Great for 2 people."
2137,30,"Hi Erin, Its such a bummer to hear that your experience was negative. I really wish you would have contacted me about the issues you are describing while you were there instead of here, two weeks later. The problems sound unusual and I would have loved to try to correct them. There are spare light bulbs stored at the house that I could have directed you to or come over and changed for you. We have a professional pest control company and cleaning company and I will pass this feedback along to them."
2138,30,Very cozy and convenient location. Would stay again.
2139,30,"just as described. we had a great time. good location and perfect for our four night stay. might get a little cramped for a longer stay if you have a child with you, which we did."
2140,30,Same as description! And great location!
2141,30,"First let me say that overall my experience was good. Communication and check in were smooth and the location was fantastic. The beach was a short walk down the street and we really enjoyed using the beach as our ""sidewalk"" to get to the boardwalk. From the description I thought there was more space between the containers, but being that my sister and nephew were in the other container, it wasn't an issue for me.
As for the cleanliness, it could have been better for my liking. I brought lysol wipes so I was able to clean to my satisfaction, however, the bathroom smell stale... almost like mildew. I determined that was due to the fact it was extremely humid inside, therefore the shower curtain and floor mat took a long time to dry. We tried to remedy this as much as we could by keeping all the fans and air conditione running. because if we didn't there would be condensation. Container #1 had a dehumidifier which definitely helped. I would suggest that one be purchased for this container as well.
Overall the experience wasn't bad and for the location alone I'd say give it go."
2142,30,"This container home is perfect to have a vacation spot at the beach. It is clean, well furnished and walking distance to the beach. The decks are very private and you can enjoy food or drinks at night. This container home have more room than you think! It is perfect for a couple and the owner allows doggies too!"
2143,30,"As described . Easy 2-3 minute walk to the beach!
Container #2 is street side -
That’s where we stayed .
It was still quiet , in a nice part of the beach . It sits on a large lot with plenty of shrubs & landscaping between the 2 units. First night , we walked to the local tiki bar for dinner & sat outside . People watched , enjoyed the cocktails & food . We never cooked in the rental . Our recommendations for this particular trip include :
Wake n Bake for coffee & donuts. The Southerly for breakfast biscuits. Sunoco gas station ( also called Kwik Mart ) that sells everything BUT fuel - ( burgers , hot dogs & Philly cheesesteaks!!!!!)
Hands down our best meal on the island was Soul Food .
Benny’s Big Time Pizza in Wilmington was worth the drive. Shelly was a great host & made good recommendations ."
2144,30,"This Airbnb was fantastic. It's ideal for two individuals. Although the Airbnb was clean, the windows over the kitchen and in the living room area lacked curtains, giving the impression that we were being observed. Overall, a peaceful location with a pleasant walk to the beach. We'll definitely be returning in the summer!"
2145,30,"This location was very great stay, close to the beach, and gave my husband and dog everything that we needed. We enjoyed the container home a lot, and can definitely see ourselves in something similar one day."
2146,30,Not reccommended
2147,30,This guest booked the house for one night but thought they booked it for two nights. It’s a mistake that happens sometimes and I worked with them for a super late checkout. They were still disgruntled and left a terrible review.
2148,30,"Wonderful location as home base for my island adventures and it was the ideal size for myself, but would have still been comfy if I was travelling with another!"
2149,31,"I was surprised to find another tiny cabin just 50 feet from ours. They did a good job of using privacy fencing, but the privacy was still lacking slightly. If this was listed in the description and I missed it, please disregard.

My wife and I stayed four nights and only had two towels and one hand towel. The kitchen only had one roll of paper towels. For longer stays, I would suggest more of these and other often used items.

Emily was very responsive to all questions and one small problem. She was quick to offer advice and seek solutions. For a large family who might want to spread out in two tiny cabins, this would be a great place. They have put a lot of work into the property and it shows. We did not use the sauna, but it looks very inviting. Marion NC is beautiful as are the views from the property!"
2150,31,"Tiny house was a great experience! The town wasn’t as exciting and lively as we hoped, but still found stuff to do. Definitely recommend for the price if you’re going to use the sauna and kayaks!"
2151,31,great little space with great potential for meeting fun new people!
2152,31,Had an amazing time. We will definitely be returning!
2153,31,"Great stay, quiet and comfy. loved the sauna!"
2154,31,"Very cute tiny house cabin nestled on lake James river. Host responded to issues quickly and was helpful in many areas. For future booking reference regarding linens speak with Emily to make sure you have enough for your stay. Could have been cleaned a little better, but all in all it was a nice tiny home."
2155,31,Patti didnt tell me her daughter was traveling with her so we assumed the queen bed was fine. She complained the fans werent dusted but said everything else was great from a cleaning standpoint. She contacted me multiple times daily during her stay including late at night saying there wasnt enough dish soap and when she checked out there was still plenty left. She rated the tiny mostly 5’s and gave a 3 for cleaningbecause a ceiling fan wasnt dusted. I am proud of the work the cleaner does and she takes photos of everything to make sure a quality job is done. We have added dusting fans to the checklist. I am disappointed she rated us a 3 overall; the math doesnt add up.
2156,31,"Emily place was easy to find, clean, and an l around enjoyable stay!"
2157,31,"My friend and I needed a wonderful weekend away and this is exactly what is was. Peaceful and relaxing.

Was worried that I would forget a dish or two for cooking but no need to worry, this tiny home had everything!!! I honestly probably didn’t need to bring any cooking utensils!

GREAT HOSTS & RESPONSE TIME.
INSTRUCTIONS AND DIRECTIONS WERE CLEAR AS COULD BE!

I think my friend and I will make this our yearly visit"
2158,31,Great place with lots to do.
2159,31,Beautiful place and very peaceful and it is a happy place for relaxing
2160,31,Setting is quiet but the other homes are pretty close so it doesn't feel very private. We didn't have cell service so it was quite unplugged indeed!
2161,31,We had a good time. The surroundings were very pretty and the river was nice.
2162,31,"Very quiet! Cozy. We wish we could have stayed longer to utilize the fire pit. Propane tanks were a little difficult to manage in the dark when we arrived, but worked well! We would be interested in staying again, perhaps bringing more family or friends next time. Emily was super responsive and the place is secluded so that was exactly what we were looking for. The tiny home is beautifully well done too! Close enough to hikes you can enjoy too for many days at a time and still be comfortable."
2163,31,we really enjoyed being close to so many trails
2164,31,"We loved this tiny house. It was just enough space for my partner and I to relax and reconnect. There was even enough room for my partner to do their morning yoga. We spent most of our time outdoors sitting by the fire and stargazing. Loved the picture windows to watch the sunrise from bed. We booked both of Emily’s listings at this location, but this one felt pretty private on its own. Would definitely book again."
2165,31,We had a great stay in this Tiny House! Marion NC is only 5 miles away and has so many shops and restaurants. Our one and only issue was that we expected (based on pictures) the lot to be more private. There are other Tiny Houses within 20ft of this unit and another guests who arrived late were a bit loud until they settled in and you have to share the outdoor amenities with them. My wife wasn't happy about that. I would still recommend staying here though.
2166,31,"The tiny house was so cute!! I loved it so much! It is super cozy and there were little notes around that were super helpful for using the kitchen, water, etc. The house was super clean as well! I highly recommend staying there!"
2167,31,"Beautiful location, very spacious tiny home & we loved the coziness feel."
2168,31,Emily’s place was great and cozy ! She provided clear instructions and was very responsive. I will definitely be looking to stay here again.
2169,31,"So many great things to say. Second time staying and the instructions are super helpful, thorough, and easy. Very clean and peaceful."
2170,31,"Lisa, it makes my hear sing when guests want to come back to my happy place and enjoy it. The sauna was finished two hours after you left so please come back and I will give you a big discount. Did you like the newly tiled bathroom?"
2171,31,Nice place
2172,31,you were great emily! tiny was adorable. hope to be back soon
2173,31,This was a great place to stay! Very cute and cozy. Emily was very friendly and responsive to any questions I had
2174,31,"what a nice place to get away from others and enjoy some alone time. this place is located right next to a stream/river, so the fresh air is nice and cool :) it got a little spooky when it was misty and/or dark, so i recommend arriving when there’s still daylight, haha! however, the place was nice and surprisingly has a lot of space"
2175,31,I really enjoyed my stay at Emily’s tiny house. It was challenging dealing with the cold weather on the first night. Thankfully she has everything you need inside (thick blankets) to help keep warm. I’m grateful to find such a rare peaceful gem to spend on Christmas Day!
2176,31,We had an amazing stay at Emily’s tiny home! Check in instructions were thorough and had lot of helpful info on the place and area. Beautiful location. Would stay again in a heartbeat.
2177,31,"We had a very cozy stay, and Emily was very helpful. Beautiful area and we enjoyed our time. Highly recommend with many awesome hikes and waterfalls close by."
2178,31,"This spot is a gem! Very peaceful and quite, the spot is tucked away from the roadway and set back in the woods close to the creek. We had a great time and for a tiny home we did not feel cramped in. The listing was as it said it was and picture were accurate. Emily is an exceptional host, she is very responsive and is easy to get a hold of. She made our stay special!"
2179,31,"Beautiful place to stay, would come back in a heartbeat, Emily was great to work with. Pictures do the property justice and then some. Comfy bed, nice hot shower and could look at the night sky from the comfort of our bed."
2180,31,Nice stay to get away from everything and unplug! Nice comfy bed with large tv where you can play dvd’s that are provided. Was very peaceful being near the River. Will be staying again!
2181,31,"This was the most amazing home I've stayed in, I was extremely impressed by the decor and very happy with the atmosphere. It was a wonderful escape from city life. I would love to return very soon"
2182,31,Overall fine
2183,31,"Emily was an incredible host! The property was clean and cozy, the atmosphere was peaceful and we enjoyed every minute! Will definitely be returning!"
2184,31,"We stayed here for just three nights, but we would come back for sure! It was so cute, cozy and quiet. We loved the location and would love to come during the summer to enjoy the river behind the property. Overall we had an amazing time!"
2185,31,Emily’s place is a great spot to rest and recharge. It was very comfortable and cozy for the weekend. It’s also pretty close to some chill hikes around Lake James and the Fonta Flora State Trail! We had a little bit of service at the tiny house (AT&T). Would definitely stay again.
2186,31,Couldn’t have been happier starting in Emily’s tiny home. Thank you
2187,31,"No complaints, had a great stay, just what I needed in a getaway. Would go again. Host very communicative and helpful. Accurate description of what you’re getting. Nice and peaceful place to getaway from it all."
2188,31,"Easy going, very clean, nice and cozy."
2189,31,"Such a beautiful cozy tiny home! Me and my husband wanted a place to relax while we visit towns in the area. I highly recommend going to the Carson House in Marion if you love history! And then go have fun in Asheville! Tonsssss of things to do there.
We did not utilize the fire pit outside or the hammock cause we wanted to crash inside, but it was a very nice setup.
There were books provided that me and my husband enjoyed reading. Plenty of DVDs to choose from, also a few channels on the TV. The bed was very cozy and that says a lot because we own a Sleep Number mattress!
We needed assistance with something and had to reach out to Emily and she responded within minutes and was very kind and has a great personality!
We plan on staying here again and I highly recommend it if you’re looking for a chill/cozy place to stay!"
2190,31,Such a beautiful private getaway! We loved taking the kayaks out on Lake James. This cozy tiny home had everything we needed. Can’t wait to return!
2191,31,This little house is the perfect tiny getaway from it all when you need some peace and quiet. It's in a really great location if you're going to be visiting the Lake James State Park. It was nice and clean and the hosts were great at communication. It's a wonderful little spot.
2192,31,Really lovely place!
2193,31,We loved our weekend trip to this tiny home! The bedroom is so cozy and the bed and linens were comfortable! It was great to be in nature with lots of natural light from all of the windows in the home. The property is off the beaten path but close to town for a bite to eat at one of the cafes. The property was perfect for resting up in between hikes and visiting Asheville.
2194,31,"The tiny house it’s self was adorable! Nice and clean on arrival. The location was a little different than expected. There was a camper like right next door, which was a bit closer than I was expecting to have neighbors. The river access was also a bit difficult because the water was so low. We had to get through quite a bit of mud before able to use our kayaks. There are a ton of great breweries close by (10-15 min), which was a huge hit for us. We would definitely stay again"
2195,31,We are building a communal glamping retreat and have photos of the RV next door so guests are aware. The hope is groups of friends or family will want to come stay together. I am about to list two units together and will update the description to try to make it more clear. Thanks for the feedback and glad you enjoyed Marion. I have never been there when the river is that low. That is really strange. I will ask around the next time I stay about river levels so I can update the listing.
2196,31,It was good stay
2197,31,Yatri was a good guest. We charge less than $90 a night and lower than average cleaning fee compared to most listings in the area. I was surprised to receive 3/4 stars for reviews. We did not receive any contact during the stay with any needs. We usually receive five star reviews from our guests.
2198,31,Clean stay and quiet location.
2199,31,The tiny home and the location were both wonderful! Anytime I messaged them with questions they answered and helped me out right away! I'm sure I'll be back.💕
2200,31,We had a wonderful stay at Emily’s place!!
2201,31,"Everything you need to have a great experience in a tiny house. Cleanliness, resources, quality. Forget your screens for a few days and enjoy this place.
The hosts provide you with all the necessary information and are always ready to help and answer any doubt you may have."
2202,31,An absolute must stay! Easily the best air bnb I’ve ever enjoyed. The tiny home is precious. The property is sureal and the activities are top notch. Wake up and walk down to the river for a kayak to a private and peaceful waterfall or out into the lake. Relax in the hammocm and have a fire pit. Check out Tom’s creek falls and the vintage market in town. Beautiful getaway!
2203,31,"The place was great, right on the river leading to the lake. Area was quiet and just as described. Owner communicated very well."
2204,31,the location is really nice and the ability to easily kayak is a huge plus. the tiny home is great and the 3 of us had plenty of room. we grilled out and cooked breakfast. the home had all the utensils and pans we needed. we would definitely stay again.
2205,31,"My husband and I really enjoyed our getaway!! It was so nice to unplug and have no worries!!
Both hosts were super nice!!
The tiny house was super clean, welcoming and so cozy!! It rained most of the time we were there but we enjoyed cuddling up and listening to the rain on the tin roof with a cup of coffee!. We played in the rain and we did get a day to take the kayaks out fishing!! It was so much fun and a time we'll always remember!!!

....ps ...the little lady at the general store was so precious!! She was helpful and so sweet!! She deserves props for sure!!! Go say hi...she'll love it!!! ❤️
Cant wait to go back!!!

-Tiffanie & Jesse. -WV"
2206,31,"Beautiful place, location, and we loved how exclusive but open it was. Would definitely recommend for anyone looking around the area."
2207,31,"Perfect unplugged getaway. The tiny home literally has everything you need. The location was perfect as we were away from people and close enough to town if we needed anything. We enjoyed kayaking, hiking, and driving along the Blueridge Parkway! Had a great dinner at McDowell Local and drinks at Mica Brewery in Marion."
2208,31,if you love the outdoors this place is for you. the house provided everything we needed but we didn't spend much time there. being right on the river was perfect. took the kayaks to the lake fishing one day and then went up river to sightsee aother. it was beautiful. I would highly recommend taking plenty of bug repellent though!
2209,31,We really enjoyed our stay at the tiny home. The location is super easy to get to/from while still feeling like it is tucked away deep in nature. We loved the ability to disconnect from the digital world for a while. Definitely would stay here again!
2210,31,Lovely place as always. Old camper added right next door but nothing bad about it.
2211,31,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Emily’s place. It was comfortable, clean, and very cozy. It was great to disconnect and escape as described. I also appreciate the added benefit of being able to get out on the water, by way of the kayak & paddle board. Paddling down to the waterfall area, and/or out onto the lake is a must!"
2212,31,"we are incredibly thankful for the space that is this tiny home. It was our first time staying in a tiny home, and it went above and beyond her expectations. It was an amazing space to unplug for the weekend and relax. We will definitely be back!"
2213,31,The tiny house was really cute and located right at the river. My friend and I kayaked to a waterfall that was super close and we barely saw anyone else.
2214,31,We really loved our stay at Emily’s place. The experience was amazing and we spent a lot of time kayaking out on the lake. We will for sure be telling all of our friends about the amazing unplugged times we had.
2215,31,Great for 2 people. River access was important to us. Location to trails and falls is spectacular.
2216,31,"Everything was wonderful, quiet, and relaxed"
2217,31,Beautiful place! Exactly as shown in the photos. We had a great time fishing and even caught a 5lb Bass!!
2218,31,Highly recommended for a wonderful retreat from everyday life. The river access was great. The bed was wonderful. We enjoyed nightly fire pit family time! Clean and beautiful little area! We kayaked and rented a pontoon for one day. Perfect time!
2219,31,"The location is easily found and accessed with the check in directions. There are several little notes posted around that were helpful. Great private location as we had no neighbors. Our first Tiny House experience went really well, it is comfortable and well appointed. Most of our time was spent in hammocks or chairs by the water, very relaxing. I'll be back."
2220,31,It was pretty easy to find. Between directions with my gps and her direction with pictures I found it with no problem. The place was nice and cozy. The perfect size and well priced compared to others. I did a solo vacation so wasn’t looking for a big place. The days it rained I enjoyed the rain and a couple of good books and some movies she had on dvd. The days it didn’t rain I enjoyed the river. There were a couple kayaks and a paddle board there. I definitely recommend checking out the river. Very peaceful. It was nice and secluded. Definitely recommend if you wanna unplug and relax. Also I have T-Mobile and I got decent cell service while there.
2221,31,The tiny house was equipped with everything one would need to have a great time in this location. The house is right on the river and we spent both days kayaking. Kayaking was amazing as the river was very calm and the location is not crowded with a bunch of other boats despite being close to the lake (at least while we were there during the week). Host was communicative and responsive. There was no one in the RV or houseboat on either side of the tiny house so it was very private while being very close to town/grocery stores etc. we would 10/10 recommend this tiny home stay!
2222,31,"We really enjoyed ourselves. There wasn't anyone else staying next to us which is what we really like. There are kayaks but we only saw one life jacket. My husband's shoulders are bad, so we didn't kayak but if we go back, I really want to. It would be very easy to put in the water at the end of the property.
The tiny home is adorable. Very comfortable, clean and the window views are great. I wanted to know what it is like to stay in one and it is more spacious than I thought. No tv, but a dvd player in the bedroom where we watched movies at night. The mattress is very comfortable. Waking up in the bedroom viewing trees was awesome.
Not much going on in the town of Marion. If you are looking for specialty food or shopping it is worth the 45-minute drive to Ashville.
The other nice feature is you can have a fire out back.
The hosts did a good job! Thank you"
2223,31,"This is a cute tiny home on a campsite right near the water. There were RVs next door, but I never saw anyone and had a lot of privacy. The kayaking was great and there were some awesome hikes nearby."
2224,31,Nice place to disconnect
2225,31,I was so happy to be able to unplug & relax in a peaceful environment. It was in a nice quiet location with a beautiful view. I would stay here again.
2226,31,Everything about the weekend was perfect. The rain sounds were out of this world. Can’t wait to return!
2227,31,"Lovely place, we really enjoyed the outdoor area and spent a lot of time there. The lake access is beautiful and calm. Highly recommend!"
2228,31,If you like the water and a way to unplug and relax then this is the place. The tiny home has lots of amenities that give your stay comfort and the location is private without being out-of touch.
2229,31,Awesome place in the woods. Close enough to town for convince but far enough for the backwoods feel.
2230,31,"We enjoyed our stay!!! Very detailed directions and information were provided making it easy to navigate the roads and find the property as well as get set up for a cozy stay. Check-in was super easy and the home had everything we needed for a week of fun, and the host was easy to reach and very responsive to questions."
2231,31,We had a great stay in the tiny home! The location was secluded and serene - a great place to completely unplug! The kayaks and standup paddleboard were great. We spent both days rowing up and down the river to the lake. The kitchen is fully stocked and has everything that you would need. We’re already looking forward to visiting again in the future.
2232,31,"Great, peaceful location. Immediate access to the river and close to Marion to pop into town."
2233,31,"A beautiful little house that has everything you need and it's sitting right on the water, it was so peaceful."
2234,31,"This place is the BEST!

I soon as we arrived my cell phone was turned off and I truly “unplugged”. It’s soooo quiet here and peaceful. When you are inside the tiny home the massive window makes it feel like you are still outside while you are cooking.

I had packed 2 kayaks for the trip but the house had two available to use 🥰

We spent the day kayaking and venturing to the rapids and falls……

I truly can’t wait to go back"
2235,31,"Wonderful area, wonderful home, wonderful experience overall. This tiny home is amazing and we loved everything about it!"
2236,31,"I am SOOO thankful for the Universe allowing me to stumble upon this gem. If you are truly looking to unwind and disconnect, this is the place. The pictures and the description are spot on and are an understatement at the same time. Although it is a tiny house, it is more than enough space to be comfortable. This had to be Thoreau's experience!!! I'll definitely be returning!!!!"
2237,32,"Would definitely stay again, great spot/location and very conveniently located"
2238,32,It was great to stay somewhere where beach was basically in backyard. Only issue I had was the WiFi was horrible which made it a little difficult to get to my email to see code to get inside and once inside light above bed was out and tv channel wasn’t working at all since WiFi did not work.
2239,32,"Great location, and easy access to the beach. Perfect place for a stay at the beach!"
2240,32,The location was perfect! Right across the street from the beach. But the place could use a Good few updates. There are stains and marks all over the walls. There is damage from previous animals chewing on the furniture. The bed is lumpy and could use a headboard. Overall it looks like a college bachelor pad.
2241,32,It was perfect for the occasion as I was here on business. Wi-Fi a little sore but outside of that perfect
2242,32,Great place to stay. The location is great and close to the beach. Lew was extremely helpful and responsive.
2243,32,Very nice place in a quiet and nice neighborhood. Enjoyed my stay and will definitely be back again!
2244,32,Great Location - loved the short walk to the beach and the quiet. It's also within walking distance of the Lighthouse. Lew was very responsive and nice!
2245,32,As advertised.
2246,32,"This location is a bit bland in its decor and overall ambience but suffices for an easy and convenient place to stay. Just down the road from the oak island lighthouse. A few things could be updated(light was missing a glass dome, back door missing a window, bed a bit sunken in) but overall an okay experience. Communication was quick and easy with the owner. It’s no 5 star hotel but certainly a functional convenience to have."
2247,32,"I had a great and short stay at this property. It was exactly as described. The owner, Lew, was very helpful and responded to every message promptly. The room was clean and everything was thoughtfully provided. I would definitely bring my dog back for another short stay."
2248,32,This was a great stay in Oak Island! The room is clean and well stocked. The area is quiet and peaceful. It is right next to the beach so you can’t beat that. Plenty to do nearby. 100% recommend.
2249,32,"Low cost, close to ocean, quiet."
2250,32,"Just stayed here this week and had a good experience. The room looks just like it does in the pictures and it was a great location. It was a bit cold for the pool (which may already be closed) but you can walk right across the street and be at the beach in no time! It's close to the pier and some great bar/restaurants. Everything was clean and fresh and for this price, I will be going back often."
2251,32,Stay away that place for free is to much
2252,32,"We were extremely disappointed in this rental property. First of all, I have been going to Oak Island for over 20 years and this is the worst experience I’ve ever had. It’s actually the worst I’ve had with Airbnb and we book with them frequently. When we arrived, we thought someone else was staying in this unit because there was beach junk right outside the door and didn’t want to barge in at 9pm. Had to call the owner and he said he needed to “haul it off”.

As soon as we walked in there was -
1- A baseboard detached from the wall laying in the hallway with a giant rusty nail sticking out
2- There was sand everywhere, I used two towels to clean the floors and when I was done they were both dark brown like the floor hadn’t been cleaned in a while (still didn’t even feel clean after that)
3- The quilt on the bed felt like it had a layer of grime on it (including sand) like it hadn’t been washed or swapped out in months. We threw it in the corner of the room
4- The walls were damaged and stained with idk what
5- There was chew damage from a previous dog in the bathroom that had not been cleaned up or repaired, there were still wood shavings on the floor
6- There was some kind of fly infestation, we killed about 10 big flies and several gnats that night. The next morning there were more and we couldn’t find where they were coming from
7- The mattress is really old and has a huge dip in the middle, very uncomfortable. We slept with only the sheet (hoping at least those had been cleaned)
8- This place stunk like an old, musty basement that hadn’t been cared for in a long time

I texted the owner that night to tell him about how unclean his place was. No apology, only that he would speak with his cleaning lady. My husband and I did not even want to spend one night in this place but we had nowhere else to stay, luckily we had friends coming the next day. After they saw the place they insisted we stay with them the remainder of our trip and we did not hesitate. My pregnant self and husband slept on their couch.

I texted the owner the next day stating that we would not be able to stay in his place, that the photos were very misleading, it was not suitable to stay in, and that we would like a refund. I requested a refund several times with no acknowledgement of it. He stated he was “taking care of my concerns” by sending the cleaning lady back for me to show her what needed to be cleaned. This place needed a whole lot more than just a second quick cleaning. Its been neglected and was honestly really depressing to be there. No cleaning fee refund, no partial refund, nothing. I even personally sent the owner extra money PRIOR to our arrival for an extra night (did not refund that either). We felt ripped off. A few hours after we packed up our things and left, he sent me some pictures of the place from the cleaning lady saying “everything looks good” and all I could do was laugh.. this place is just terrible. The owner will say he did his part by having it “cleaned” a second time and that it was our decision to leave, but this place should not even be allowed to be a rental property. The owner got his money and that’s all he cared about, not the experience of his guests or the condition of his place. Do not stay here. I did not respond to the photos and tried to enjoy the rest of our vacation."
2253,32,Don't get me wrong my wife and I had a nice and peaceful stay. But after our departure we get a message saying we damaged sheets and comforter from a pet. We don't even have a pet. My wife and I bring our own because and we understand people get in a rush and forget about the sheets and things. On the day we left we kindly placed the comforter and sheets in the middle of the floor. Not to mention the place is very out dated and not very clean.
2254,32,"Thank you so much for an amazing spot. It’s a great location and I really enjoyed my time here. Overall everything was wonderful. I did have some issues with the internet going out which was not a huge deal for me because I was trying to not be on my phone or social media. :) I would have loved to be able to do is sit out back with the dog and enjoy that area a little bit. Unfortunately there where too many “prickly plants” (not really sure what they were) but they definitely hurt lol and also got stuck in my pups paws so we stayed away from the backyard area. It is so close to the beach, which was super empty maybe one or two other families there with me. Sadly the pool was closed- not really sure why but that was okay too cause I spent most of my time on the beach. Overall amazing trip. I do highly recommend-"
2255,32,Very convenient walk to the beach. Only a short drive to dining and entertainment.
2256,32,This is a great stay for a single person or couple! Location was ideal and Lew was very responsive with any questions. I would stay at this location again!
2257,32,"Very close to the beach. Like walk down a sidewalk and across the street close. Also close to the pool. Great for a simple, quick trip. Has microwave, toaster oven, coffeemaker, nice sized mini fridge, basic kitchen utensils. Never got Wi-Fi, but wasn’t a huge deal. Clean."
2258,32,"I really enjoyed my stay at Lew's. I had a few technical issues when making my reservation and he was super patient and responsive! There were no issues with check in or out. This place is great for a no frills escape to relax and recharge. The only issue we had was with the amount of sand we tracked in, but what else can you expect when you are at the beach!"
2259,32,Great location to the beach and surrounding areas. Basically what the rest of the positive reviews have stated are accurate and can give better descriptions than this post.
2260,32,"Stayed here for our honeymoon! Great place to stay if you are looking for a location similar to a hotel room. The pool is very close and stayed pretty empty. The room was very clean and tidy. Set up like a hotel room. Walk to the beach is very short and easy and not busy at all. The fridge had lots of room, stove , microwave and coffee pot. Was some renovating going on upstairs so sleeping in past 9 was not really allowed lol but other than that was a great place."
2261,32,"The location cannot be beat! The space has what you need. A bed, TV, Couch, bathroom, and small fridge. Since you can walk to the beach in 3 minutes you won't be spending a lot of time there. We were on the beach all the time!
The dogs were welcome and enjoyed the space as well especially the AC after a hot day at the beach."
2262,32,We had a wonderful time staying a week at this location. Lew was very quick to respond if we needed anything during our stay. Everyone we met at this location was extremely nice. Perfect location with beach access. Would recommend a couple or single to stay here.
2263,32,"Oak Island is a wonderful quiet community. The stay is right by the beach
Literally a 2 minute walk across the street. It was great for our overnight but if you're on a budget, and pick this, know there's no traditional kitchen. So you will need to grab food from one of the great restaurants around. Also the bed could use an upgrade, especially if you're staying more than a few days. Overall it was a nice overnight trip to the beach."
2264,32,Great for the price! Amazing location! The beach is about a 3 min walk. Wifi was pretty spotty and didn’t always connect. But over all it was a really great stay. We would definitely come again!
2265,32,Lews place was a great location for my short beach trip. The beach was a short 3-4 minute walk. Caswell beach is a beautiful beach and was not crowded at all.
2266,32,"This place was affordable and very near the beach, just a short walk across the street. Check in and out was easy, and it was accurately described. This is the perfect place if you just need a cheap place to sleep and shower on your beach trip. For future residents: come prepared. The unit was pretty bare bones (e.g. there wasn’t even toilet paper available upon arrival) so bring your own paper products, plates, utensils, etc etc.
Cleanliness could have been better."
2267,32,"This was the perfect location near the ocean for us and our 2 dogs! The only thing is, I thought there would be a stove/oven for buying fish from Haag and Sons and cooking it for dinner, but there's actually just a toaster oven and microwave. It probably wouldn't have been a deal breaker but it's probably helpful to know for planning.

We had a couple of things come up, but Lew always responded immediately/within a couple of minutes at most, and that was awesome. Somehow I never got the code for the door, and also I forgot the directions not to go upstairs when I didn't see the lockbox on the ground floor and thought I had the wrong room, but Lew got us to the right place and inside right away lol

All in all, this is a great small spot- room, beach, island, and I'm already planning on when I can come back, thanks Lew!"
2268,32,"Lew’s place is awesome, it’s really close the the beach by walking distance. Its like literally the back of the airbnb. At night you can hear the beauty of nature at work. His backyard to me is the hidden gem. In the morning you can literally hear the birds chirping"
2269,32,"Great place for solo travelers. Felt extremely safe, location is wonderful & had a great time! Host was very kind and responded very quickly!"
2270,32,"Great little place a 3 minute walk from the beach! Clean and comfortable, this was the perfect home base for a short beach getaway. Lew has a great little place for a great price especially if you look at costs in the area.

Caswell Beach was lovely, dog-friendly, with soft white sand and gentle waves. To get to the beach, you can walk to the left of the lot (if you’re facing the entrance) where the unit is located and there’s a little board walk path that take you right to the beach."
2271,32,"A very dated, simple unit, but had everything we needed for our stay. Mini fridge, toaster oven, and microwave. We found the bed to be very uncomfortable and the comforter had burn holes and what appeared to be purple marker drawn all over the back. We noted some suggestions for Lew on other things we were not pleased with, and hoping it helps make future guests more comfortable. The price was nice and location was absolutely perfect - steps from the quiet beach and a great, friendly neighborhood for walks. We also love that Lew’s place was dog-friendly so our pup could join and enjoy the beach."
2272,32,thoroughly enjoyed my stay here! perfect for solo travelers looking for something simple and close to the beach. Lew was very patient and responded quickly! unit was cozy and clean and located directly next to beach access.
2273,32,"Such a great spot!
The room was the perfect size for a small family getaway. We’ll definitely be visiting again!"
2274,33,"Cozy, clean and comfortable cabin with a beautiful view and location!"
2275,33,"Wonderful, cozy, peaceful cabin on the lake. Very responsive host and wonderful experience. Would love to stay again in the future!"
2276,33,"Truly the views are million dollar ones! The peace, tranquility + picturesque setting at sunrise + sunset is unbeatable on the extra large screened in porch!
The king size bed had the most comfortable mattress + provided an excellent night of sleep.
A very cozy lake cottage that we will recommend over + over!"
2277,33,Had a wonderful stay!
2278,33,"This property is a gem! A beautiful peaceful spot right on the water. The cottage is tastefully decorated, and the screened in porch overlooking the water is an added bonus. We were very comfortable here, and didn't want to leave. Our pups enjoyed it just as much as we did, and we were so happy to be able to have them with us. Rachel is a super host. She has thought of everything and her attention to detail was very much appreciated. She was very responsive to all of my questions. I hope that we are able to stay here again if ever in the area."
2279,33,Perfect for the two of us plus our dog! We had such a relaxing weekend away? And Rachel was incredibly helpful!
2280,33,This place was beautiful and even better than the pictures! We will definitely be back!:) The hosts were super helpful and it was so clean and peaceful.
2281,33,Beautiful home and location. Will stay again!
2282,33,"Great place! Definitely, I will recommend and stay again."
2283,33,We loved staying here! Rachel was such a wonderful host! We plan to return soon!!
2284,33,Super pet friendly and yet so clean; no sign of prior pets such as hair in corners or smell. Lots of windows and large screen porch overhanging the lake provided great views of both sunrise and sunset even from inside the cabin. It was unseasonably cold (never really got out of the teens during our visit) so couldn't fully enjoy all the lake front setting had to offer so will need to return in the future!
2285,33,"Very nice view & right on the lake! The attatched covered/screened porch was terrific and private! Lots of cookware, bbq and full size fridge. Nice fun sheets!
I would come back to this cozy cute cottage. It was also walking distance from the marina, Nice!"
2286,33,Water views for days!! Such a lovely spot to get away to! Everything was perfect! A true treasure
2287,33,This home on the lake was fantastic. The solitude and coziness made a real great place for us to explore Alexander County. Rachel was great communicating with and very accommodating. Would definitely recommend this cozy cabin on Lake Hickory!
2288,33,"We had a wonderful and relaxing weekend staying on the lake. This home had beautiful views. The back screened in deck was so inviting and the perfect place to read and unwind. We would definitely stay here again, and would recommend it to friends and family."
2289,33,Seriously one of the best places I have ever stayed!
2290,33,"This little cozy lakeside getaway was exactly what we were hoping for, and more. The cute cabin has everything you could need - a giant comfortable bed, tons of blankets and towels, a large walk-in shower, and a little kitchen with all the makings. They even had dog bowls for our little pup! The best part, without a doubt, is the huge screened-in balcony with amazing views of the lake, docks, and fall foliage. Make some coffee in the morning and watch the fog roll in. We spent most of our time out there just relaxing and listening to the birds and water... My favorite memory was sitting out on the balcony during a thunderstorm one night, and the sound of the rain on the metal roof was so hypnotizing... We highly recommend this little sweet escape to anyone who wants to spend some time by the lake. Also, there is a park with a lot of walking trails just a few minutes away, and if you want a more skilled hike, Rocky Face Mountain is just 20 minutes away and a really fun hike with views."
2291,33,We had a wonderful time! Weather was fantastic to sit on the dock and enjoy the sunshine. A perfect place to get away and relax for a few days! Studio had everything we needed!
2292,33,"Nice,beautiful cabin.
Perfect place for vacation or weekend."
2293,33,This was a perfect slice of heaven on a lake. I loved sitting in the dock in the cove and just enjoying the lake view. It was the relaxation I needed.
2294,33,"Absolutely beautiful place. Spending the days exploring Hickory and the surrounding areas, to coming back to the cabin and spending all night on the deck was more than I could have asked for. Definitely will be coming back to stay!"
2295,33,Amazing place! Will come again! Highly recommend!
2296,33,We had a wonderful time. The view was so beautiful and peaceful. The unit was very clean and comfortable. We will definitely stay here again.
2297,33,"Great little cabin on Lake Hickory.
Clean, nice boat dock, great location for us. We were transferring our boat to the marina that is literally around the corner. Also, most importantly, they are pet friendly.
Thank you again for a great few days in the lake."
2298,33,"This was our second time staying at this house, and we will definitely come back! The house was clean and inviting, and it is a great place to take your pups! The house has a great loaction, and the view of the lakw from the porch is stunning."
2299,33,"What a beautiful place! Reserved for a girls weekend. Only an hour from Charlotte. Cute, clean with beautiful views of the lake and sunset. Would definitely stay again!"
2300,33,"If you’re looking for a cozy, peaceful place to stay this is the one!! The view is beautiful, the porch is just amazing and the area is top tier for a fun little get away to swim, fish or just watch the critters in the water."
2301,33,We had an amazing time! The cabin was clean and comfortable. It’s in a beautiful location that is absolutely stunning! We definitely hope to visit again sometime.
2302,33,I was so happy to spend my birthday weekend at the cabin. It was so relaxing and we loved being able to fish right off the dock. I would recommend this cabin to anyone wanting quiet time at the lake. it was close enough to town and so serene. I'm saving this listing so we can go stay again in the future!
2303,33,We really enjoyed the screened porch and the dock!
2304,33,"Absolutely amazing place! Everything you could need has been thought of and the level of cleanliness goes above and beyond what I expected. In my opinion, the host has created the perfect space to relax (the porch/balcony is genius)"
2305,33,"This cabin is amazing. The location is perfect. Everything about it screams relaxation. The screened in porch got much use -- We rotated through all the available seating in there throughout our stay watching the sunset, watching the storm, just chilling, etc. The private dock and the little lake inlet was loved by our dogs. I brought my paddle board and loved being able to launch at the cabin's launch ramp."
2306,33,20 out of a 10 place. This is hands down my favorite bnb. We brought floats and relaxed with our 2 year old all weekend. We had plans to go into town but couldn’t leave the property because it was so gorgeous. We loved rain on the deck the most. I can’t wait to go back. Thinking of booking? Do it and stop browsing. This is the place to be for a private spot on the water!
2307,33,"Wonderful place for two. Beautiful views, cozy but more than ample space except in the bathroom sink area which doesn't have much counter space. Kitchen was stocked well although we didn't cook much. Rachael was very helpful through the whole process. She is an excellent host. I would definitely recommend this place."
2308,33,Great place to stay...clean and comfortable
2309,33,"This is one of my favorite airbnb experiences to date! The cabin had everything you could think of and a bunch of stuff I didn't. The lovely shower made me feel like I was at a spa resort and the bed was oh so comfy! Walking around the neighborhood was wonderful, it's just beautiful and everyone we met was so friendly! There's a park nearby that we went to on one of the cooler days and explored along the river and in the woods for hours. But you don't even have to do that! Just sitting on the lovely porch in the rain made for a perfect day and on a sunny day you can just grab a chair and go sit on the floating dock and sunbathe and swim. I could go on and on about all the wonderful things about this trip but I'll just leave it at that and encourage you to visit and find out for yourself! Thank you Rachel! We hope to come back some day!"
2310,33,"Private, peaceful setting on the lake as described. If you want a private retreat to unwind & relax, this is it."
2311,33,The screened in porch was my favorite!
2312,33,"Relaxing time sitting on the deck overlooking the lake. Even one night when it poured down rain, it was so cool to sit and watch the rain hit the lake and the storm to pass overhead!"
2313,33,This rental was a perfect weekend getaway! We took our two dogs and they absolutely loved swimming in the lake. The waterfront area is very private and the new dock is large with a lot of space. The area was quiet and within close distance to stores and restaurants. We got take out from Apple City BBQ and it was a great way to end the trip! Highly recommend if you’re looking for nice getaway with the fam and fur babies.
2314,33,beautiful quiet stay!
2315,33,This is wonderful lake cabin with a perfect view and very peaceful. You will love the screened porch over the lake
2316,33,This home is a little piece of heaven. Loved enjoying coffee and spending evenings on the screened in front porch. Kids had a blast in the water and on the swing. Hosts were very welcoming and responsive. Would highly recommend to anyone coming into area as a wonderful place to stay.
2317,33,"Wonderful stay! We are locals and wanted a quiet little getaway to relax with our dog by the lake for a few days. The place was cozy, stocked with everything we needed and the view and convenience is perfect! Rachel was so great to work with!"
2318,33,"We had a great time at the lake cabin! Our dogs loved being on the porch watching boats and birds go by. They swam for the first time in the lake! The space was perfect for us - two adults and the dogs. We easily cooked breakfast and dinner, went fishing on the dock and enjoyed the perfect weather on the porch. Highly recommend! Super cozy, quiet and beautiful view."
2319,33,We were surprised to learn that the host lives about a hundred feet away from the property but the lake and cabin are beautiful. When we got there there was a bottle of champagne and Reese’s cups waiting for us which was such a sweet surprise!
2320,33,"This cottage is wonderful! The views are great! A peaceful, beautiful place to stay!!
(Easy communication with the owner; easy to find!! )"
2321,33,I took my 2 oldest grandsons here for couple days .. we had a great stay enjoyed everything about this place the grandsons slept on the screen porch it was so nice ... Will come again . The hosts were very friendly and accommodating ...
2322,33,Great location on the lake in a beautiful cove !! Very peaceful and relaxing
2323,33,"We had a lovely stay at Rachel’s. The views are incredible, the house was very clean and comfortable and the house is easily accessible."
2324,33,"The view on the lake is beautiful, and the enclosed back porch is fantastic to enjoy being outside without keeping the bugs company. The cabin had everything you’d need to have a comfortable and self-reliant stay. I hope we can visit again soon!"
2325,33,This is our second time staying here and we enjoyed it just as much this time as we did last time.
2326,33,"We miss the cabin already! I was in town for work in Hickory and South Carolina and the cabin was in a great location to get to where I needed. Rachel made available to us children's items that we could use for our son and the cabin had great features like magnetic curtains and door shades that made bedtime with a toddler easy. We were able to sit on the screened-in porch after he went to sleep and listen to the sounds of the water and bats. The cabin is close to restaurants, parks, and the mountains- and the proximity to the water can't be beaten. My only regret is that we could not stay longer!"
2327,33,"We had a great stay! Everything you need, they had in the cabin. The inside was very clean, comfy bed and she left biscuits for our 2 pups.
Also left us a mini bottle of champagne for us. We grilled burgers and ate on the porch, was so nice (make sure to wipe the table off, tons of pollen). Saw SO many turtles and some snakes. Very relaxing!"
2328,33,This was one of my husband and I favorite air bnbs we’ve stayed in. The location is great right on the lake with a screened in sun room to enjoy the breeze. Very very dog friendly which was huge for us. Lots of great hiking places close by including riverbend park with miles and miles of trails just 4 minutes from the cabin. The cabin itself had incredibly well stocked kitchen and attention to detail throughout. Definitely hope to stay again. Highly recommended.
2329,33,"Idyllic setting for my husband and me with our two pups and we cherished the privacy and ease of arriving/departing. A setting on the lake with spectacular views, watching wildlife, and access to a well stocked kitchen made this a memorable vacation!"
2330,33,"My husband and I (along with the dog) spent a Fri-Mon in this adorable, lovely cabin. We found this cabin to be a great value. Even though the hosts live in the main house on the property, we felt like we had the property to ourselves because of the way the cabin is situation on the land in relation to the main house. The massive screened-in porch was where we spent a lot of our time - and it made the entire cabin feel more spacious. We could have stayed comfortably here for weeks! It was easy to unload and launch our kayaks. The dog LOVED swimming and dock diving every day. The little cove the cabin is on somehow feels quite private on this otherwise busy lake. The kitchen is small but well-equipped for some cooking. Taylorsville has very little by way of restaurants or shopping so we did go to Hickory for two wonderful dinners. But if you didn't want to leave, you could cook all of your meals in the kitchen, for sure. Rachel was very easy to communicate with. And if you have a dog, they leave you a few biscuits, a medium-sized bed, towels for the dog, a few toys and multiple food/water bowls! The cabin is clean and updated and the king bed is a huge plus! We would definitely stay here again!"
2331,33,"An amazing stay! Cozy with a full kitchen to cook all your meals. The screened in porch is a heavenly spot. I brought a Bluetooth speaker which made it even more relaxing to listen to music while hanging out in the egg swing and watching my boys fishing on the dock below.

We enjoyed visiting Hickory and Hiddenite during our stay. Don’t miss the sunrise on the porch with a cup of coffee!"
2332,33,This remarkable location is a great getaway. Very quiet and peaceful. Be sure to catch the sunrise over the lake. Splendid.
2333,33,"We loved our stay at Lake Hickory, it was wonderfully child and dog friendly in a quiet and peaceful location."
2334,33,"We enjoyed our stay in early spring. It was a bit chilly to sit out in the screened porch very long, but it was a gorgeous sight, and would be truly awesome in slightly warmer weather! (The space is dog-friendly and made us wish we had one.)
The space is very well built with large, energy-efficient windows—no howling wind or creaky noises!
Full kitchen and plenty of space to relax. Comfy bed and good shower. Very private and relaxing with amazing views out every window."
2335,33,Great weekend getaway right on the lake. Enjoyed fishing and spending time on the covered porch atop the lake. Went to Bethlehem steak and seafood and had a great dining experience. Very much enjoyed this cabin for a much needed getaway. Host was very nice and responded to communication. Will be coming back for sure.
2336,33,"Brick cabin was clean, well-stocked, in a private, wooded cove. Made for a great, serene getaway, with screened- in porch, perched over the lake. Tiled, walk- in shower, plenty of seating, drive up carport and all the amenities. Hope to visit again."
2337,33,"Great location, clean and well appointed. Hosts are very accommodating, would definitely return."
2338,33,"This was a great stay. I would stay there again. I definitely will recommend anybody that needs a stay at the lake or guest or client that needs a place to crash for the night.
Host is super fast to answer.

As a real estate agent, www.MarlonRodriguezHomes.com
I have clients needing places to stay when they flight in from another parts of the country to purchase properties and what better than to stay at a lake house."
2339,33,Wonderful home and property. You will not be disappointed with this stay! I loved it!! Beautiful!!
2340,33,Very clean and beautiful view! I let them know we were bringing our dog and they even left treats on his towel for him. Would definitely stay here again!
2341,33,This place was tidy and had everything you would need while being away from home. There’s Wi-fi too!
2342,33,This was a great place to be. Would recommend to anyone.
2343,33,This is the most beautiful home location. There are no pictures that can show the true beauty of this home and location. I love it and will be back.
2344,33,Great weekend getaway
2345,33,"We truly enjoyed it here. There was beautiful views, quiet, relaxing. The location is great. I enjoyed the ""egg"" swing."
2346,33,"Rachel's cabin was a fantastic place to stay!!! We couldn't have asked for more. She has thought of every possible detail you could imagine. Cozy, quiet, amazing views just to start with. We could go on and on. You'll have to try it for yourself and see. AMAZING!!!!"
2347,33,Great stay from beginning to end.
2348,33,We’ve stayed here 3 times now because of the beautiful view of the lake. If your going for a relaxing stay this is the place for you. Being back in a cove it provides you with privacy and quietness. The cabin itself is clean and bright and offers many amenities to make your stay stress free. Did I mention that screened in porch? It’s very spacious It has plenty of sitting options! I highly recommend
2349,33,We loved our Fall getaway weekend at this cabin. It was equipped with everything we needed plus more. The views are picture perfect and it was very relaxing and peaceful. We enjoyed exploring this area as well. Rachel has done an outstanding job of creating a host guide book that gave us many new places to hike and eat.
2350,33,"This was such a special spot. The screened in porch was perfect and so was the weather. We left lights off and used LED flame-less candles and it was perfect!
Definitely will return as soon as we can get away again."
2351,33,"This is a great find! House was very spacious for our family of 3. Very Clean!!! Screened in porch was truly amazing. Beautiful view! Huge windows in the house to view the water. Bed was very comfortable w nice bedding. Hard wood floors throughout. Decorations current and not outdated. Kitchen completely stocked w dishes, pans, etc. Plenty of hooks for towels, coats, clothes. Loved the full length mirror and electrical outlet for extra space to dry hair, apply make up while others are in the bathroom. Power strips on both sides of bed was great. Host was so easy to work with. Very fast responses Covered parking was nice when it rained. Marina is literally around the corner. We boated over for ice cream. Lake was not crazy busy w other boats. Nice to have boat ramp at the house although steep as new boaters. There is plenty of grass to enter the ramp from the side and lower on the ramp if needed. We ate at Apple BBQ. Delicious! Fun things to see and do in Hickory. Excellent space to stay!"
2352,33,Lovely place. Great location. Awesome weather!
2353,33,"Great cabin.
Location perfect
Very nice organized."
2354,33,What a cute little lake house! I took my wife there for a birthday getaway and she loved it! It was perfect!
2355,33,"Oh my goodness! I don’t want to say too much good about this little gem, because the secret will get out, will always be booked and we will never get a chance to go there again! We’ve stayed at several Airbnb‘s all over the country and I can tell you, this one is one of the best. First, it’s located right on the shore of, in our opinion, one of the most beautiful lakes in the state of North Carolina. It’s quiet, the water is warm and clear, there’s great fishing and oh did I mention it’s quiet? It has a beautiful screened in porch where you can sit and just enjoy nature without worrying about bugs. It’s very cozy inside. The bed is comfortable, the shower is big and the kitchen is great. There is plenty of great things to do and see in the area too. We highly recommend this wonderful place at the lake. We have been showing pictures of the place to all of our friends and can’t stop bragging how wonderful it was. The air conditioning and heating worked great so we were never uncomfortable. We felt very secure too. The owners live right up the hill and were very respectful of our privacy. We will definitely be coming back soon!"
2356,33,"Wow, Kristine! Thank you for such a kind review. That means so much and we are so happy you thoroughly enjoyed your stay. We look forward to hosting you again in the Spring."
2357,33,This was our 2nd stay here. Another great day and another great place. Color is about to change and this will be a beautiful in a different light.
2358,33,Amazing peaceful escape! The cabin has everything you could need and immediately feels like home.
2359,33,"The huge screen porch over the lake did not disappoint, and the clean and comfortable living space was well-equipped with everything from bedside plug strip for charging phones to dog water bowls. Add in good communication and easy access to NC16 and you can understand all the five star ratings. Great place!"
2360,33,"This place was amazing, my fiancé is already planning on coming back. We loved the enclosed deck and the dock that we fished off of. It was a relaxing and great vacation!"
2361,33,"Rachel and her cozy cabin were the best! We used this as an overflow space for a family reunion happening at my own Lake Hickory home... but this cabin's view was BETTER than my own home! It really is a charming space with a top-notch location on the lake and a killer view. Rachel was responsive and gracious. The space was clean, and everything was well thought out. We will be back!"
2362,33,"We had a wonderful stay at this lake cabin! The place was so clean and had great amenities. We loved having lake access on the property, and the the area was so peaceful! I highly recommend this spot for your next getaway!"
2363,33,Cozy and immaculate studio space with a wonderful outdoor room overlooking a small cove. There is a dock and boat access. A great place for a couple to unwind or a small family to have fun.
2364,33,Great relaxing spot on the lake! Refreshing to relax on the porch and read a book while looking out on and listening to the lake.
2365,33,"Great quiet getaway right on the lake—perfect for swimming, boating, or just enjoying the view."
2366,35,Slept like a baby. Super comfortable. Love this cabin and the peaceful atmosphere. The horses are a bonus
2367,35,"Great little gem on a beautiful horse farm. Elisha was very responsive and her instructions were more than clear. It was quite chilly that night but the “fire place” space heater was a nice touch and cozy (definitely recommend closing the curtains to the bathroom overnight if it’s really cold). It was a great resting place to staying with my dog on the way to PA from FL. Highly recommend! Thanks, Elisha!"
2368,35,Stayed here on the way to Florida from New Hampshire and on the way back. Awesome place to stay for whatever occasion.
2369,35,Elisha’s Horse Cabin is perfect for studying and reading! Highly recommend going here!!!
2370,35,Great place to stay!
2371,35,Loved staying here for a little weekend getaway. Brought my pup and she loved meeting the horses and going for a walk at Raven Rock. Cabin was cute and very well kept. Definitely recommend staying here.
2372,35,This cabin is adorable!! Looks just like the pictures but even cuter in person. Elisha was so helpful staying on the phone with me to make sure I got in okay upon arrival and even recommended local places if I needed anything. Will definitely stay here again!
2373,35,What a magical stay! Out of our 3 bookings for a trip with my brother and mother to North Carolina this was the one we felt most peaceful at. The cabin was cozy and Elisha was incredibly helpful with her clear instructions. You wake up and you hear birds and see turkey vultures and horses hanging out in the day. The entire cabin is horse themed and made the stay there for family even that more special. We definitely will be back!
2374,35,gets the job done
2375,35,"This is a great place… In a country, setting… Very peaceful… Very quiet… I and an exceptional value!"
2376,35,Elisha was very welcoming and her place was perfect for our needs
2377,35,We travel to Dunn often and this was the first time we stayed in this place and it was wonderful! Very cute and well decorated inside and was a fair price for what we needed
2378,35,"We had a great stay and will absolutely be back in our travels between north and south. This was the perfect half way point to spend the night, and it was so nice to enjoy the peaceful property after so much driving. We just sat in the grass by the horses and enjoyed our coffee with the sunshine. The cabin was cozy and cute, it felt like home and it was sooo nice to be able to let my 13 year old roam a little bit on the property since I dont usually let her far when traveling. Elisha was a nice host, had great suggestions for the area and then left us to our night. We will absolutely be back on our next trip."
2379,35,I love this tiny cabin. The bed is awesome. The night sky is beautiful. The location is so convenient. I do hope I can return. It is a fun place to spend the night.
2380,35,Rustic cute cabin great for overnight or 2 nights stay. Great location. Love the horses. Warm southern hospitality!
2381,35,We stayed for one night. The host accommodated our late check in and also walked us through the check in instructions over the phone. Nice little private cabin with comfortable bed and clean bathroom.
2382,35,Really enjoyed our two evenings at the cabin. It suited our needs just perfectly.
2383,35,"We had a great overnight stay in Elisha's unique, horse themed cabin. It was convenient to I95, clean & cozy. Elisha met us at the cabin & went over everything- would definitely return!"
2384,35,"Second time staying here doing the 95 corridor. Perfect half way point close to the highway. This time i was prepared. Small propane grill, ribeyes, cold beer. Perfect stopover on a farm"
2385,35,Very cute tiny cabin with just the right stuff for an overnight or two. Elisha was helpful with suggestions for dinner out. Easily accessible. Comfy bed.
2386,35,"I had a good stay, literally only stopped for a shower and few hours of sleep, then got back on the road. Elisha was helpful and responsive every time I reached out. Would stay here again if needed another quick/convenient pit stop."
2387,35,This place was a treat to stay in while I drove from Florida to NY. The cabin is super cosy and bigger than the photos seem. We loved visiting the horses. Elisha is super nice. I’ll definitely stay again.
2388,35,Incredible!
2389,35,This is my favorite spot on my long drive and always look forward to coming back here.
2390,35,Cute and cozy cabin. Elisha gave detailed directions that where very helpful. Great stopover on our way home from Florida. Would stay again.
2391,35,Great spot to stay not far off of 95. We just slept and hit the road :)
2392,35,"Elisha was very responsive before and during my stay. The cabin is so cute and perfect for what I needed. The double bed was very comfortable. The shower was a little small but had amazing water pressure and hot water as well as essentials. The only negative thing I could say, but it did not bother me, it is fairly dusty especially where the climate control unit blows on the wall. Overall, I had a great stay and will stay here again"
2393,35,"great as always, thank you."
2394,35,"Elisha’s place was perfect for our family! We got in a couple hours before dark, enjoyed visiting the horses, talking with Elisha, & swinging on the porch. Even though it was really cold Elisha had the cabin heat on so it was cozy all thru our stay! Great place to rest up for a night - felt like being with family. Very welcoming, friendly, cozy, & private. Highly recommend."
2395,35,"Like several others, this was a great halfway stop between FL and up north. It is dog friendly and perfect for them to stretch their legs. We spent 2 nights at the cabin. It’s private and secluded yet only 2 miles from downtown. We did some thrift shopping, lunch and beer tasting in town.
The little cabin had a very comfortable bed, TV and DVD movies. Plenty of towels, soap and shampoo. When at the cabin we spent the time outside with the dogs and talking to the horses. Our comfort was the #1 concern for our hostess."
2396,35,Nice place to stay.
2397,35,"We just needed a place to stay for the night on our way home from Florida and this fit the bill.
Elisha has a very comfortable rustic cabin. Though it is small, there is plenty of room to be comfortable. There were lots of Niceties provided.
Elisha is a very friendly and helpful host.
This really was a nice relaxing stopover that we will surely be back to.
Thanks"
2398,35,We have stayed here last year. Nice and quiet.
2399,35,The cabin was very cozy - perfect for a road trip pit stop.
2400,35,"beautiful cozy cabin, I would definitely book it again!"
2401,35,Perfect right off the Highway place to stay and so quiet and peaceful. We have stayed here twice now on our drive from Florida to Vermont and vice versa. Such a cute place!!
2402,35,"The cabin was very easy to find and to get into. We were there after dark and left before light so I can't speak to the surroundings except to say the area was very peaceful. Shower was hot and the double bed was comfortable. Cabin was clean and had all we needed for the one night we were there. Fairly short drive to restaurants, gas, and I-95."
2403,35,Very cute and cozy cabin! Perfect place to relax after a long day on the road!
2404,35,"Cute, cozy little spot. Wonderful stay!"
2405,35,Perfect spot to stay while driving from Florida to Pennsylvania.
2406,35,Always a great night sleep at the Horse farm. cozy and comfortable
2407,35,"Great stay, easy communication!"
2408,35,This is the second time I’ve stayed at this air bnb and I absolutely LOVE it. I stayed there as a halfway point on a long drive both times and I actually tweaked my plans by a day so I would be able to book this specific air bnb again. 🙂
2409,35,"Elisha's cabin was a cozy place for us to rest en-route to home from the holidays. we felt safe, secure, and comfy."
2410,35,"This was the perfect place to relax, unwind, and still be close to family we were visiting. Elisha was friendly and very responsive. The cabin was quiet and the area was pretty."
2411,35,Great little cabin!
2412,35,"I can say it was another great stay, I would recommend if you are driving through or in the area you should definitely book the cabin"
2413,35,An amazing host and a great location ! We loved our stay there! Bear I95! Worked so well for us! I cozy and beautiful wooden cabin! would definitely recommend it ! Thank you so much !
2414,35,Elisha’s Horse Cabin is a great place to stay for your own private time to study in my case but for others to just get away! Hospitality is a gift or Elisha’s and I cannot wait to stay again in the future! Highly recommend!
2415,35,"We have stayed here many times as Dunn is our halfway point to SC, dog-friendly and cozy just perfect for our overnight stops."
2416,35,"I love staying here! This cabin has Twilight on DVD, 10/10"
2417,35,Quiet and simple. Perfect stay for human and dogs traveling that need a good night's sleep and to stretch our legs! Will definitely look to stay here again on my north to south (and south to north) travels. Super quick communication from host.
2418,35,amazing time thank you 💕
2419,35,Our favorite stop on our trips to/from Florida!
2420,35,"We needed a place to stay off I-95 with certain necessities and Elisha's cabin was perfect for our needs. Communication with her was absolutely wonderful; she wasn't able to be there when we checked in but told me what to do over the phone and it was painless. Also, both her and her mother are lovely people that had a quick chat with us while we were there. Some might describe it as small, but we found it cozy and large enough even for a person with limited mobility (though that may not be the case for everyone in a similar situation). The place is so thoughtfully decorated in a way that fits the charm of a rustic cabin on a farm and the outside was done up for Halloween. There was no shortage of towels, soaps, and creamer/sugars and there was a decent selection of DVDs and books on offer as well. The cabin has a mini fridge, microwave, and k-cup coffee machine which is all we ever need. There's a good sized tv on top of a lovely electric fireplace heater (there's AC too) and a three folding tv tables available. The water in the walk-in shower was consistently hot and the pressure was adequate. The place is pet friendly which is wonderful, but it could be triggering for some people with allergies. That was an issue we ran into and one that I don't believe is easily resolved so do keep that in mind. Other than that, we enjoyed our stay."
2421,35,"great place for a quick overnight. we traveled from Central NY to Jacksonville FL and this was a perfect place to split the trip up. comfortable bed, clean, organized. only ""complaint"" I'd have would be no internet available but at the same time it's not a deal breaker. plenty of cell service to keep you connected. will definitely be back on our next trip down south."
2422,35,This was a cozy and comfortable place to stay. There were many cute plaques/sayings around that added a little humor based around cowboys and horses. The communication was thorough. If you are interested in a throwback to roughing it a little this unique small house is for you!
2423,35,"This was a ""motel"" stay for us, going north and returning south. Quiet, off the ""beaten path"", comfortable, and just about everything you need. You can tell that Elisha wants her guests to be happy they stayed there. The steak house up the road on the other side of I-95 was great, also."
2424,35,This was perfect for what we needed traveling to see family. It was a nice stop for us to stretch our legs and sleep. It was clean and comfortable.
2425,35,"I really enjoyed staying in this little horse farm cabin. This was a one night stopover for my homeward-bound motorcycle trip. The cabin is cozy, charming, and wonderfully isolated from other buildings - maybe about 50 yards from the nearest structure - so there is all the privacy you could probably ever want. No cable or wi-fi, but that was no biggie since I had good 5G service (G**gle Fi) for tethering my laptop. Amenities were just fine for one night: Keurig, microwave, mini-fridge, and a TV with a good selection of DVDs. Also plenty of restaurants within a few minutes drive. Elisha popped over immediately after I let her know I had arrived and gave me a quick run-down of the place, invited me to explore the property, and then pretty much left me alone, which was perfect. Definitely recommend this neat little place for a one-person, one- or two-night stay. I say one person because there is not technically a door to the bathroom - just a curtain - which, for me at least, is a ""solo situation"". However for others that might not be a big deal."
2426,35,Had a wonderful night stay at Elisha's place. Elisha is easy to reach and very available for her guest. Beautiful little rustic cabin with everything you can possibly need for a short stay. Nicely decorated. Horses and Halloween. Will definetly try to book again for our trip back up north in the spring.
2427,35,"We were not staying here for the ""area"". We just needed a place to sleep as we traveled to Maryland. Elisha's place served that purpose just fine."
2428,35,"This rustic Western style place was festive with Halloween and fall decorations when we drove up!
It was fun driving to the gate and seeing the lights.
It was off the grid which is what we wanted after traveling all afternoon.
The horses were beautiful!
We enjoyed sitting on the porch swing in the morning watching the horses. We have beautiful pictures of them to remember!
Elisha and her Mom were so sweet and helpful!"
2429,35,"I had a great stay at Elisha’s cabin! The cabin was the perfect place to crash during a busy weekend visiting a local university. It’s very quiet and cozy. Elisha is very accommodating when you communicate about your check-in time. I had a slight change in my check-in time and Elisha worked with me, making the process very smooth."
2430,35,Quiet place off the highway with plenty of places to grab a bite to eat.
2431,35,Always an amazing stay
2432,35,Cutest cabin. My daughter goes to Campbell university and it was nice to have a place to stay that I could bring the dogs since my daughter misses them. Small cabin but charming. Shower had great water pressure. Full bed was comfortable My son said bunk bed slept good. Clean and decorated so cute. Will stay here again if I need a place to stay in the area. Great value
2433,35,"We absolutely loved our one - night stay at this cute cabin. Very close to the 95 corridor. Perfect for up to a 3-4 person family with a double bed and a bunk bed. Nicely stocked with a small fridge, keurig with coffee, plenty of towels and toiletries. Elisha is an excellent host. A wonderful thing was seeing the horses in the pastures before we left in the AM. Would be very happy to stay here again if travelling i-95!"
2434,35,"I cant believe so many people rated this place so high. The only positives was easy check in and there are horses on the property. This place was NOT clean. Dust was caked everywhere, dog hair all over bottom bunk and some dog hair on full bed, black mold in air unit, shower unclean, sink unclean, bedding was cheapest possible, microfiber noodle sheets and comforter, lots of bugs in lights. Was scheduled to stay 2 nights, wouldn't have even stayed 1 if I wouldn't have already told my child we would take her back to the Mule Days Parade the following day. She would not refund me my money for the second night. Spoke with her over the phone to tell her the place was unclean, not fit for my child who has seasonal allergies, and we would not be staying the 2nd night. She told me it wasnt dirty and that i would not receive any money back. I took plenty of pics to prove otherwise."
2435,35,Elisha’s Horse Farm Cabin is the perfect place to stay if you need peace and quiet. For a Campbell University Divinity School student who lives two hours away this was a perfect personal sanctuary! Elisha has the gift of hospitality and it shows! Highly recommend!
2436,35,Great stay and you are so kind to be available for a call to walk through getting in and everything. Thank you!
2437,35,Enjoyed our stay! It was nice and tucked off the road with a big yard for the dogs.
2438,35,This is a great place for a quick stop to sleep. We love the fact that our truck is secure instead of staying at a hotel where it may not be safe. Very clean and cozy.
2439,35,Incredibly cute and cozy
2440,35,"This was my second time to stay at the cabin, and it worked just as well as the first time. It was much hotter weather this time, and the AC worked great."
2441,35,"Cute and comfortable little cabin on a beautiful horse farm back drop. We stopped here overnight on our trip back home to Fl. We got in close to midnight. Elisha’s communication on how to get there and get in were spot on and she left lights on for us.
The seasonally decorated front entrance and inside was unique and tastefully done. We definitely will stop and stay again as it’s a straight shot on and off I 95."
2442,35,Such a wonderful place to stay if you’re passing through. Quant and adorable!
2443,35,This cute cabin was a perfect place to rest on our road trip. We loved the variety of DVD’s available and the decorations in and on the porch of the cabin. Our dog loved the open grass space right outside the cabin. The host was very kind and communicative. We would definitely stay here again!
2444,35,enjoyed it a lot. bunk bed mattresses not real comfy for an adult
2445,35,Cozy cabin for a great price. Will stay here again if I'm ever back in Dunn.
2446,35,Great stop off. We love the farm and privacy.
2447,35,"Place is great! Very clean, perfect decor and great communication from the host"
2448,35,Lovely as always for our family of 4 plus a small dog :)
2449,35,This was the perfect end to our weekend adventure getaway! I miss it already. Literally everything about it was perfect.
2450,35,"This was the cutest, most unique place we have ever stayed. Beds we so comfortable, great water pressure and really hot. Even though it was pouring rain outside, the rain on the tin roof helped us quickly relax after a long day! Many personal touches. Will stay again for sure!"
2451,35,Good stay
2452,35,Enjoyed our stay as always! We regularly use Elisha’s place as a rest stop for our trips from New York to Florida and back 😊
2453,35,"No Fuss No Must. Would definitely stay here again, when passing through."
2454,35,All you need is there.
2455,35,We loved our short stay at this little tin roofed log cabin. It is ideal for a couple or small family. Elisha was very responsive and answered all our questions. We’d definitely stay here again.
2456,35,"I had the best rest in this cute cabin, waking to a beautiful view. The place was exactly as described. No problems and the communication was great. Would definitely stay again."
2457,35,"Very cute comfortable cabin on a horse farm, the owner was very commutated on how to get in the property and where it is located."
2458,35,Unique place and great host.
2459,35,"This cabin was awesome, so cute and the perfect stopping point for my road trip! Thank you!"
2460,35,We have stayed at Alisha’s cabin several times and absolutely love it! It is secluded and quiet. She has it beautifully decorated and stocked. It is easy to get to and convenient for our trips up and down 95.
2461,35,stay was comfortable had a great night sleep. Thank you
2462,35,"great little cabin right off 95. clean inside, great AC and the horses were nice for the boys."
2463,35,Thank you for sharing your home with us ! All of your personal touches were awesome!
2464,35,"We stayed at the farm for an overnight from our move to FL. And this place couldn't be any easier. It shoot straight from i95 which is super easy for our travel. Restaurants, grocery, and gas were 5mins drive. Place was supr cute, communication with Elisha waa easy. The cabin have everything we need for an overnight. We came in late but was still able to see the horses in their stables. Definitely a good rest stop."
2465,35,Elisha has a really cute and comfortable place to stay. Highly recommended!
2466,35,"Elisha's cabin was cozy, clean and very comfortable. The horse farm setting was quiet and so relaxing.
A wonderful place to stop while traveling."
2467,35,"Cute, cozy, relaxing & safe! My dog buddy enjoyed exploring the farm. Great place to stop along 95. Drive thru Starbucks and other places to stop just a couple of miles away. Super-smooth start to finish. Would definitely stay again!"
2468,35,Convenient place to stop on our way home from vacation
2469,35,"WONDERFUL place! It’s very quiet. All I heard at night were crickets and a distant train whistle. Cabin is adorable, clean and comfy. And the skies…I watched the sunset and then watched the Big Dipper come out. So many stars! You’ll love the horsey decor and the live horses, too!"
2470,35,What a great little cabin! We were moving with a Uhaul pulling a vehicle and this could not have been a place to stop. It has everything you'd need for a short stay. Clean and cozy.
2471,36,Wonderful stay! Very unique Airbnb and an amazing little town! The host had many recommendations and was super friendly.
2472,36,"This is just what we needed for a get a way! Quite area , such a cute cabin with fantastic views of the river. We met Bruce & he was very nice and accommodating and enjoyed meeting his beautiful rescue pup also 😍❤ Book it you won't be sorry!"
2473,36,"great place!

Bruce was super communicative, kind, and polite. Also, Bruce was super kind to me with my schedule. I ended up having to change my dates and he was very easy to work with and adapted to my schedule.

The place was amazing. Kind of like a tiny house. Wished it wasn't raining but that didn't damper how pretty it was and how much I enjoyed the house.

hoping to be back!"
2474,36,"Bro omg this was probably one of the shining moments of my trip- Bruce was very kind. 100% would stay again if I'm back in the area.

-sunrise & sunset are absolutely breathtaking to watch from the dock
-cat scared the daylights out of us coming to say hi after dark (yes, this is positive)"
2475,36,PHENOMENAL! Want a secluded weekend away? Look no further. Bruce has thought of it all when it comes to this magical place. We spent most of our time sitting outside with nature and just taking in the views. Bruce was very responsive and even brought us sugar when we realized we needed some extra! We are already planning our next trip back.
2476,36,"I can’t WAIT to stay again! Such a cute, cozy, and peaceful place."
2477,36,I love this place. The views. The wildlife. It all comes together for a peaceful place to unwind.
2478,36,"Bruce was available to greet us on arrival and quickly answered any questions/ concerns.
We had an absolutely wonderful time while staying at River Watch. It was quiet, restful, and magical. We highly recommend this AirBnb location. We will be back!"
2479,36,Awesome weekend! Just what we needed! Place was very inviting and cozy!
2480,36,"It’s my home away from home when I’m in the area for work and Bruce has been so lovely to work with. Communication has been seamless and the attention to detail he has put in this space is amazing. This trip I got to drink coffee watching the mating behavior of the geese on the water, and the call of a vixen fox in the evening."
2481,36,So much character and such a peaceful setting!
2482,36,Pier and back deck are beautiful and peaceful. Home is cozy and comfortable. So much thought and craftsmanship has gone into making this place a perfect relaxing getaway!
2483,36,"We had a wonderful weekend at Bruce’s cabin! Super cozy and inviting with so much charm and attention to detail throughout every corner. Views of the river are beautiful and serve as the focal point as well as entertainment - watching boats quietly pass in the early morning, squirrels jumping through the trees from the deck. Check in was easy and the cabin was equipped with everything we needed for a weekend getaway. We will certainly be back in the warmer months to take advantage of the dock!

Bruce is a very friendly host - my boyfriend enjoyed talking cars with a fellow VW lover! :)"
2484,36,"Bruce's River Watch Retreat is incredible! Quiet, peaceful and relaxing. The cabin is stocked with everything you need for a comfortable stay, and the construction and decor are awesomely unique. Bruce is a great host, super friendly and made totally sure we had everything we needed. We highly recommend this secret gem!"
2485,36,"Your welks! Wow, I really appreciate your stellar review.
What you said about the cabin itself and ambience is humbling. Soo glad you all felt that way here.
Cheers - Bruce"
2486,36,"We love staying on the Trent river and it was a private comfortable place to stay!
Bruce met us and made us & our dogs feel at home. He explained how do you say heater. Later he answered questions about the TV too. Bruce told us about the ISS viewing possibly at dusk as the sun was setting and we appreciated the information.
Bruce made sure we were satisfied with our stay and it was open to any suggestions that we had to make the state better.
If we pass this way again, we would love to stay here again!"
2487,36,A perfect setting for a relaxing last minute trip to New Bern with my two pups. The retreat had all the amenities needed but the uniqueness and eclectic artistically designed decor elements were what really made this spot stand out...in addition to the tranquil surroundings. A quick fifteen minute drive to the downtown area made it easily accessible to everything the delightful town of New Bern had to offer. Bruce was extremely responsive and eager to assist in ensuring we had a wonderful stay. I will definitely be returning for more time at the River Watch Retreat!
2488,36,We had a great stay at Bruce’s little getaway. The river was absolutely stunning and so peaceful. His decks provided a nice place to relax and recharge. You’re 15 minutes away from anything you need store/restaurant wise and yet feel like you’re in your own little universe. It was a perfect location for a weekend getaway.
2489,36,"We had a great stay at Bruce’s place! Located right on the River, it was so nice to wake up to the sunrise over the water. The cabin has everything you could need, and there were thoughtful touches throughout the space. We stayed over New Years and it was the perfect way to start the year!"
2490,36,Stayed for a weekend by myself and loved it. It was the peace and quite I needed. Loved drinking my coffee right on the water. Hope to come back!
2491,36,"The place is very charming, perfect for a couple’s getaway. Was comfortable, quiet, very nice location. Bruce was extremely friendly, amiable and a fantastic host. He stayed in touch as needed and always ready and timely to answer all questions. Also a perfect getaway if you have remote work to do in a quiet and peaceful location. We look forward to our return to the little cabin by the River."
2492,36,"Peaceful, cozy and just want I wanted! The river charm is adorable!"
2493,36,Amazing cute place! Bruce was an excellent host! Don’t hesitate and book it now! We will be back!
2494,36,Very unique and cozy. We would love to go back and spend a few more days.
2495,37,"Clover cabin was perfect for us. Rustic and artsy at the same time, with plenty of privacy and outdoor space to walk our dog. Cristina was a magnificent host and we had an enjoyable visit with her upon our arrival. She communicated with us from booking through check-out, answering any questions we had and making sure everything was perfect for us. We would definitely stay here again should our travels take us to the Pittsboro area. Thanks Cristina!"
2496,37,"Me and my boyfriend came to celebrate our anniversary. As soon as you walk in you feel right at home. Most places I stay it takes days to adjust, but by the end of the first night it felt like we had been living there it was so cozy. Cristina is also an awesome host. She responds fast and made sure we had everything we needed to have a fun, comfortable weekend. 10/10 would recommend if you’re looking for a quiet, peaceful weekend surrounded by nature."
2497,37,"My partner, Tessie, and I came to celebrate our one year anniversary ❤️ We enjoyed the beautiful nature surroundings, making a warm fire, playing around with the instruments, and cuddling up in this wonderfully creative space. Cristina was an amazing host. She's wonderfully friendly and communicative. I highly recommend for anyone looking for a unique little vacation in the woods that has a brilliantly creative vibe. She's a really interesting person and I hope to become friends!"
2498,37,"Thanks y’all!!! Hey, let me know when you hang up that art and we can tag the cabin and my old store, Oddco, and if I find more Marvel goodies, I’ll send them your way."
2499,37,"Had the best time here, the entire place is beautiful, I highly recommend this stay, also the bus was so fun to go and explore. 10 out of 10 would recommend."
2500,37,This place is so cozy and speaks to my inner musical girl. I tuned the guitar and enjoyed playing once again. So peaceful and quaint. The hot tub was a nice bonus after kayaking the lake. I’m also a big baking and cooking person and I was able to prepare every meal in this cute cabin for both me and my partner. The perfect couples getaway.
2501,37,Thanks so much Katie. You have made my month with those compliments. I will keep you stocked with these weird surrealist pop culture goodies If you come back and visit and check out the progress which is moving at a very fast pace now.
2502,37,"Christina was a great host who reached out and was very friendly, great place for a getaway if you want to get away from the busy."
2503,37,I had a wonderful time here. The place was exactly what we needed! Cristina gave us the privacy we needed while also being very responsive. Would highly recommend staying here!
2504,37,That is exactly what I was hoping for so thanks so much !!! Come back and visit anytime.
2505,37,"Cristina was a gracious host - helpful, warm and responsive. The cabin is as described inside but could use a good cleaning. The surroundings were not as private as we anticipated based on the listing but we enjoyed our stay."
2506,37,We loved our time at Christina's cabin. she was a great host and the cabin was wonderful. The hot tub was something I didn't know I needed! Cabin itself is nestled into the woods and is so cozy and peaceful. It rained a bunch during our stay but we opened the windows and slept to the sound of the rain on the leaves. Would recommend!
2507,37,"Host was very friendly, town was cute! Place was very unique and cozy."
2508,37,Very peaceful place. Easy checking and parking. Pictures of cabin are accurate.
2509,38,"Always a great time at the Treehouse! This was our third time here and gets better every time we go, very private and quiet and we love staying here. Lane is an awesome host, super friendly and always available, we will be back for sure ! Thanks Lane"
2510,38,"Great secluded cabin, rustic but still with all the amenities you are looking for!"
2511,38,Everything was great. Definitely going back soon
2512,38,Host is super responsive and helpful. Place is nice and secluded.
2513,38,"My 4 friends and I have been coming to Greene’s every year for a guys weekend.

We have been coming for over 5 years. This place is a great way to unplug and be outside. We spent our time walking the trails, running the dogs and sitting by the bon fire. The tree house is exactly what you’d expect. Lane is responsive and always willing to help if something is needed.

We will be back!"
2514,38,I always love staying at this little weekend getaway! Perfect for a peaceful weekend.
2515,38,One of the best locations ever!
2516,38,Love this place a great time everytime thank you lane we will be back
2517,38,"What an incredible stay.

We booked the treehouse to spend time there for Christmas Eve and Christmas.

It was peaceful, gorgeous and perfect. We spent the time enjoying the clear starry night sky, listening to music and cooking in our camping stove.

Would love to visit again with our collective kids."
2518,38,"this was our second time at the tree house. We love it! Private, peaceful...perfect! We enjoyed the screened in porch during the rain and the dock when the rain stopped. Caught a huge catfish. Lane is very responsive to any questions you may have. We already look forward to going back"
2519,38,"This cabin is a great getaway. The setting is beautiful, secluded and very private. The host provides many amenities and covers small details that make for a comfy stay. Driving to this location is really nice, past a pretty pond, along a nice wooded path, you instantly feel unplugged. It sits right on the Cape Fear River which is stunningly peaceful. This is definitely glamping as so many details are covered from the grill, private toilet, solar panels to run electrical, sink, coffee pot... all sort of goodies to make a luxury ""rugged"" stay in the woods. The cabin is charming and again, just the right amount of ruggedness to feel tucked away in the woods. Communication with the host was welcoming, helpful and timely. We hope to return in the future."
2520,38,Nice cabin and view
2521,38,Great place if you love the outdoors! Cabin is right on the river with an area to fish. Great secluded location.
2522,38,This accommodation is very unique and secluded. The location is quiet. The only issues we had were regarding spiders and cleanliness. It is a tree house so we were expecting to see some bugs but the outside shower was really dirty and covered with webs and bugs as if it has not been used in a while. Both grills were very dirty. There is a toilet in the tree house but it isn’t private at all as we can see through the walls and cannot lock the door. The solar panels were covered in dust which was probably the reason why we ran out of power often for the indoor lights. Other than that I absolutely recommend it for a nice getaway weekend with friends or family.
2523,38,Great time…. Sleepover for my granddaughters’s birthday. Enjoyed kayaking and fishing off the pier.
2524,38,It was a very great stay for family bonding!
2525,38,This stay could not have been more perfect. So secluded and off the beaten path is this charming town! Looking for a reason to go back soon!
2526,38,"Awesome place to stay! Very nice ""treehouse"" cabin, great location and wonderful host."
2527,38,"Grateful! for having available places like Mrs. Lane's tree house to rest and spend good time with the family. Thanks for hosting Mrs. Lane.
Chino family"
2528,38,"If you are looking for a rustic serenity and privacy with little modern conveniences, this is the place!! It’s simple living but so much more ❤️ perfect place to unplug but plenty of service bars if you need to use your phone.
What to expect:
Lane lays it out perfectly for you but I will reiterate: bring your own linens: fitted sheets, pillow cases, and blankets. If u use every bed in the place that would be 3 queens and 2-4 twins (for the single air mattresses) there are 4 pillows so if you need extra, bring those.
At the treehouse there is a microwave, toaster oven, coffee maker, a frying pan, pot, knives, silverware, can opener and coffee cups. Personally I brought paper cups and plates and flatware to keep dishes down. There is a mini fridge so be mindful of cold items or bring cookies to store extras. If you plan to bring something that needs heating in the microwave like spaghettios for example, bring bowls. There is a gas grill and a small charcoal grill as well. If this isn’t sufficient there is standard cooking at the pond house at the entrance such as a stove etc. Wi-Fi is also available at the pond house but we just connected our hotspot to the tv at the cabin and it was fine. We LOVED the outdoor shower at the treehouse. But if you’re shy, there is a shower at the pond house lol.
The house runs on solar so don’t try to bring all your electronics and expect it to last. Besides, this is the perfect place to unplug! There is window unit a/c and it is sufficient but a box fan or two will help in the hot weather especially for the loft, which is to be expected.
If you are looking for a Hilton experience, move on, you’re not built the same. Lol
If you’re looking for glamping, outdoors, nature, quiet, this is it!"
2529,38,Great place to stay!
2530,38,Had a great time will be going back soon thank you lane
2531,38,"This quiet getaway was just what we were looking for. We fished the river on our private dock, as well as the stocked pond."
2532,38,"Pristine, quite, private oasis just minutes both Food Lion and Walmart.

We couldn’t have been happier with the cabin, the serene location, and the ease of use.

Lane was super responsive and helpful and he even sent a video showing us exactly how to get to the cabin once we crossed on to the more remote roads. It was very helpful.

This is a wonderful place to get-away from it all with no stress and has some neat features for kids as well."
2533,38,Is as advertised. Very secluded. Had a great time.
2534,38,As always a fantastic long weekend getaway. I love the private nature where the treehouse is located. Lane is always very accommodating and the pond has some of the best fishing if you are an early bird. This is my possible fifth trip here and I have never had a bad experience. My kids leave with some of the best memories over the years. This is Glamping so be prepared with outdoor space tables .chairs and possibly an alternate light source if you use too much solar power during the day !! I always follow the instructions about wattage concerning the solar power and I usually never run only what I have to during the day so at night time I have all the conveniences I need!!
2535,38,Wonderful nature escape!
2536,38,Beautiful views and peaceful surroundings. Very friendly and quick with communication. Will definitely go again the kids enjoyed walking the trails and also great fishing.
2537,38,Great price and location will be going back lane was awesome very polite
2538,38,We had an awesome time…. Already planning our stay! Great place to go and get away from all the hustle & bustle of daily life!!
2539,38,"Our second trip here and we had a great time and love this place! Super private and relaxing, love the fishing and just hanging out on the dock or by the fire pit ! This place gets better every time we go . We will definitely be back again !"
2540,38,We really enjoyed our stay! Thank you!!
2541,38,Always a great time at Greene’s Pond. Been coming here almost every year for 6 years and will be back next year.
2542,38,"Great place, great location, great weekend! Pond and river ar beautiful and so much peace and quiet!"
2543,38,"I can’t say enough wonderful things about this place. The location is perfect with so much to do outdoors. Kayaking, hiking, camp fires, fishing, etc! You are right on the river with your own dock! There is plenty of privacy. The cabin is perfect with plenty of space and very clean. Lane was an excellent host and was so accommodating, responsive and hospitable. We can’t wait to go back to this slice of Heaven."
2544,38,We enjoyed the view and the stay
2545,38,"Our stay at Greene's Tree House, this Fall, was very quiet and relaxing for the two of us. The Tree House has a rustic, ""Hunter's"" or ""Fisherman's"" feel about the Tree House (so be prepared for a true 'cabin-like' experience), with its remote location and quietness in the woods right next to the river. (There is a Food Lion a very short distance from Greene's Pond, so obtaining last minute provisions are no trouble at all.) We enjoyed the fishing, on the docks of the river and on Greene's Pond. We will definitely come back and stay at the Tree House and/or try another of Greene's cabins next to their lake.

FYI: We would want to let future visitors be aware that the Tree House is powered by solar power, with batteries, only. With a maximum electrical load of 900 watts. This means that high wattage items, such as an electric hair dryer (most of which are 1200 watts and much more), are not able to be powered at the Tree House). Also, you will need to be mindful of the appliances you may run at the same time as to not trip a circuit breaker. (IE: Do not run two electrical heaters and the coffee maker at the same time.) Although we had no trouble with the batteries running the window air conditioner, set at 62 degrees, all night, battery consumption may be another thing to think of during your stay. There are sufficient instructions posted within the Tree House for visitors to understand these electrical limitations.
Also, be aware that the supplied appliances include a small 'dorm room-sized' microwave oven, a ~32"" tall refrigerator with a small ice cube tray compartment, a toaster oven, a coffee maker for ""ground coffee"", two electric heaters and LP gas heaters, and a 'semi-outdoor' shower. There was a small charcoal grill and a gas grill available for our use too.

Let us emphasis here, we enjoyed our stay and even found it adventurous. We will be back to Greene's Pond for another restful stay."
2546,38,"Lane is an amazing host! He is very helpful and replies to questions within minutes! The treehouse was beautiful and an exciting family adventure! This was our first airbnb and it is definitely one we’ll forever remember! My two nieces loved it and didn’t want to leave at all. Me and my sister-in-law made my brother chase all the creepy crawlies out of the outdoor shower before each use haha. We brought our cast iron pan and used the fire pit to cook each meal, which was so much fun! We went canoeing and kayaking, walked the trails, had s’mores at night with the kids, and we fished in the river (caught a little catfish - he was released)! Watching the stars come out at night and hearing the sounds of nature was so relaxing. You wake up to the birds chirping and go to bed to the crickets, and even the owls! The treehouse is the perfect glamping experience! There were some stains on the rug when we arrived, and of course there are a lot of bugs, but we didn’t have an issue with them because they stayed outside haha! Other than that the place is clean and beautiful for a “treehouse”! There are stores close by for anything you need as well! Be careful where you step by the pond house also, as the people who come with their pets in the RVs weren’t picking up after them. Lane’s property is beautiful otherwise! It is the PERFECT place to just breathe and take nature in! We definitely plan on coming back! I’d highly recommend this place to everyone who loves nature!!"
2547,38,Awesome and beautiful
2548,38,"This is a wonderful place to stay all you could need (supermarket, redbox, dollar tree) is right at the entrance to the property . I will be booking again!"
2549,38,This place was simply amazing. We enjoyed every second and truly didn’t want to leave. Great fishing guaranteed to catch! Very quiet with an amazing view.
2550,38,Our stay was perfect! Everything was just as described it was so peaceful and clean! We really liked the treehouse and are so sad to have left and will be staying here again in the future!
2551,38,My boys really enjoyed fishing at Greene’s pond. It’s secluded and peaceful.
2552,38,"This is where you want to relax at! Clean place, fishing, kayaks, firepit and grilling with many more things!! A+ AirBnb and service from host!!"
2553,38,"If you want a natural and outdoor experience this is a cabin for you. Go with trusted people because the shower is an old school shower, it’s outside with somewhat of a covering. We were scheduled to stay two nights but most of us didn’t sleep the second night, due to bed bugs. Make sure y’all clean really good or find proper instructions. They are willing to charge the additional $100 for not cleaning right."
2554,38,"great place to stay, gorgeous secluded cabin, highly recommend"
2555,38,The treehouse was the perfect place for us to have our wedding. Beautiful views and plenty of space to enjoy with our family and a few close friends. We love the tree house!! Lane was easy to work with and fast to respond!
2556,38,Awesome host! Great stay to get away for a weekend. Be prepared to have a real cabin experience with just the right amount of amenities to feel like you're in the wild while safe and comfortable at the same time.
2557,38,"This place is beautiful, being right on the water the view is always pretty. Fairly secluded if you're looking for an escape. Being right next to town made things convenient! I recommend staying here."
2558,38,Very relaxing. Well worth the money
2559,38,"This was our first AirBnB, and also our first vacation in a long time. So we were excited when this was just 1.5 hours from us, hoping to make it a regular spot. Lane was nice and texted me the day of our check in, we let him know our arrival time. He informed us that same day the fishing dock near the ""treehouse"" was damaged and to use at own risk.We got there about 730pm, we couldn't locate it at first because the property is quite large which was nice. We called Lane and he was super friendly and directed us to it. The place was very secluded which was the prefect getaway. It's typically ""glamping"" which we camp so it was nice for us. We turned in for the night. Next morning we realized the outdoor shower hadn't been maybe presser washed in a long time lots and lots of webs, bugs and debris. My boyfriend decided to go fishing, he was itching a lot thinking it was mosquitos because it was so muggy. After that we decided to go to the pond house to kayak. We had asked Lane if the boat was for rent still and he said it was out of commission. The pond house is a disaster, completely trashed. Holes in the walls, doors broken, trash everywhere. It states there is a regular shower and honestly that's stretching the truth. After kayaking for a bit, we did our own thing. The town is beautiful and super close. The next morning my boyfriend again woke up with bites all over. That day we checked out to go Raleigh for 2 days. Upon leaving guests are responsible for cleaning and disinfecting everything for the NEXT guest. Why do we pay a cleaning fee? Completely understand cleaning your mess up and leaving the place the way you found it, that's respect 101. It states on the sheet in the house you have to for the NEXT guest. On our drive my boyfriend was itching so bad be began to swell. When we checked into the hotel in Raleigh he took off his clothes only to realize it was bed bug bites. Prefect textbook pattern, plus he's a licensed exterminator. We immediately threw out all our clothes we brought with us and the sheets, towels, and pillows. We ended up finding 2 dead ones in our backpacks. In the middle of a vaction, no clothes. Quite embarrassing to have to postmates clothing to a hotel room so you can go buy more. Hitchhiker bugs are extremely common,, and we wanted to make sure we didn't bring any with us. Texted Lane to inform him, he apologized and stated he would cancel the following week reservations to get it cleaned. Per a licensed exterminator, the amount of bites my boyfriend had there was an infestation probably needing 2 treatments. I realized I had forgotten my necklace on a shelf at the treehouse, texted Lane back about it and he said he would mail it to me. It's been 12 days...still no necklace. We live 1.5 hours from there we could have picked it up. All in all if the place was maintained properly we would be regulars honestly. The pond house is disgusting, and shouldn't be mentioned, along with the fish dock and boat. That leads people to believe they are getting these amenities and they aren't. Lane was nice but could have done more then just apologize. The price if again maintained was reasonable. We loved the place but it wasn't maintained properly."
2560,38,This was a great getaway place that had a great host. Everything was very clean and the place had a nice bonfire outside and everyone in the area was very nice. The trails around the treehouse were also a cool experience!
2561,38,"It's a nice, quite, and peaceful place. There were some things that were not communicated to us prior to arriving at the cabin that should've been like the pier near the cabin being damaged and unsafe to use and the lock to the cabin door not being able to be locked from the outside. We made the best of it but I don't think we'll be coming back."
2562,38,"We stayed at the tree house during the week and it was the perfect little getaway. Lane promptly texted me that morning of to give the gate and door code and letting us know when it would be available (which was before the check-in). Our two year old had a blast and caught multiple fish right off the bank. It rained the next day but during breaks in the rain we’d go out and fish, except for my husband who fished through the rain. We kept asking our daughter if she wanted to leave earlier since it was raining and she would quickly reply, no she wanted to stay at the treehouse. We will absolutely be back over the summer to kayak and fish some more!"
2563,38,"Rustic, secluded cabin right on the river, perfect to get away to unwind from everyday life.The cabin was clean and had everything we needed. Will be back."
2564,38,Great place all around!
2565,38,"My friends and I thoroughly enjoyed our trip to the Treehouse. It is very private and relaxing. As others have said, it's rustic and offers a ""glamping"" experience. It reminded me of what you expect at State Park cabins, but with a way more homey touch. There is a TV and a DVD player, so bring your own DVDs in case of rain or a late-night movie. There was a small fridge, a microwave, a toaster oven, and a coffee pot. Like others have said, if you bring your own electrical items, make sure to look at the wattage before using as the Treehouse runs off solar power.
The private dock has a little boo-boo on it, but it held our weight fine, and we fished off of it the entire time. One little heads-up for new couples or very private people, the bathroom is inside the treehouse, which means everyone is going to know your business. You can see through the slats in the wall a bit, so it might be a little awkward for some folks. Someone out there might appreciate that warning, lol.
The front porch is the main spot. There are 4 plastic rocking chairs that were absolute heaven. It is a perfect hang-out spot any time of day, any weather (the rain doesn't get in unless the wind is whipping).
We can't wait to come back! :)"
2566,38,"We had the best time! We have 3 small children (4, 2, and 2 months) and they can’t wait to go back to “the treehouse”.
We fished every morning and evening from the dock by the treehouse and the kids caught brim and my husband caught catfish. He also caught his first striped bass!
We went walking along the trails and saw male turkeys strutting around. The kids loooved that.
We also would hope in the truck and take that short 2 minute drive to the pond house where we played with the pool table, cornhole, and went on a paddleboat.
Back at the treehouse we used the gas grill to make burgers, then did some s’mores at the bonfire before we would take our outdoors showers and head up to bed for the night.
Also, it was very helpful that there is a tv/dvd player. We brought a few movies so the kids could rest in the afternoon.
We can’t wait to go back!"
2567,38,"This place is exactly what the doctor ordered! Total privacy, sounds of nature, and just a peacefulness that was much needed. The cabin itself was cleaner then I expected and just a good vibe to it, really quaint and cozy. The front porch is a delight for morning coffee or just extra space to spread out and enjoy the surroundings. We took hammocks which quickly become the favorite spot to rest (perfect trees around and some already have hammock hooks). The firepit made for perfect evening gatherings (Lane had it set up for us with stacks of wood). Outdoor shower served it’s purpose and added to the unique experience. We had fun fishing and canoeing, all at your fingertips and easy to get to (we either walked or rode our bikes).
I had searched a long time for a place like this to get away to...so happy I found it. If you know it’s more of a camping experience and don’t need fancy or frills but has just the right amount of added conveniences, this will exceed your expectations."
2568,38,Loved this place. Kiddos had a lot of fun with the nature. Will definitely go back again
2569,38,"The Tree House was a sweet cabin on the river, and my family had such a sweet time for the weekend! It was only an hour away from Fayetteville, and totally worth the price! It was rustic cabin camping, and it was so close to a Food Lion, so we were able to get unpacked, buy food for the weekend and spend our time walking and playing in the woods. Lane was very responsive and kind! Word of advice, when we went, there had been flooding the weeks prior, so we bought two large jugs of water to drink and use for food. This was an enjoyable camping experience!"
2570,38,This place is great. Lane is the man!
2571,38,"First, This cabin is exactly how described. It’s rustic but totally has everything needed to enjoy your stay. (Not to mention it’s 5 minutes from a food lion and Walmart) There is fire wood provided, a gas grill, a fire pit and your own private dock area! It’s also located directly off a trail! (walking, do NOT try to drive it.... learned that the hard way 😅). The screened in porch area overlooks the river with some nice rocking chairs to hangout in.

We went while there was a massive amount of rain, though we still had fun, I would recommend going during sunny weather to take full advantage of everything available to do! The pond is huge! There are kayaks and canoes available as well as an abundance of little docks for fishing all around the place. The pond house looks to have seen better days BUT it’s not at all why I booked this place so it didn’t bother me at all.

Last..... Lane was an AMAZING host. He was very very quick to respond and extremely helpful when we got ourselves in a sticky situation. He seriously was the best host we have dealt with on Airbnb.

All in all this place is perfect for an upscale “glamping” trip. The tree house is a great size and amazing location with a ton of privacy! Lane, the host, is great and after a very exhilarating final morning we are already planning our trip back in a few months!

10/10 would absolutely recommend this place to any of my friends!"
2572,38,"The cabin was fun and pretty clean for a very rustic cabin, but it was more rustic than we anticipated based on the description. My young children and I visited in mid February during a freezing, rainy weekend, and managed to have a fun little adventure, but the cabin is poorly insulated and has limited electricity and only 2 space heaters that did little to combat the sub freezing temps. Had I known how insufficient the heating would be for such a weekend we would have booked somewhere else. I still give it 4 stars because it would be so much fun to visit in spring or fall, and the owner was very responsive and helpful to any questions we had, and the property was gorgeous, even in winter!"
2573,38,We stayed at Lane’s treehouse with lows in the 20’s. There were plenty of space heaters to keep us warm inside. It is certainly quiet and peaceful. We brought a stack of DVD’s to watch while we were there because it was too cold to go outside. We will be back so we can enjoy the pond and river!!!!
2574,38,"Place was Awesome and really secluded! We had a great time and it was secluded but near town for any supplies, we will definitely be back soon!"
2575,38,"A wonderful property with terrific opportunities to fish (the river & the pond are excellent). The views are incredible!! Given the primitive locale, I was hoping for a bit more quiet solitude. Perhaps Halloween was the cause for partying ATVs in close proximity..
Overall, the modest cabin provided the basic amenities for a serene weekend getaway that we thoroughly enjoyed!"
2576,38,"Felt like home, we would live there if we could!! Perfect place to relax, unwind, and recharge from everyday life. Always good when we get to disconnect from electronics, social media, and the everyday responsibilities/expectations of life and spend more “quality” time together and this was the perfect spot to do just that. Definitely a hidden gem. We’ll definitely be staying again!! :)"
2577,38,"This place is amazing!!!!! We were not entirely sure what to expect but we were beyond impressed. There is tons of outdoor space to play and run around. It’s completely private so we didn’t have to stress the entire time if our kids were being too loud. The fishing at the pond was so fun for all the kids and they all caught fish. The boathouse has stuff to entertain the kids for hours. Pool table, corn hole, kayaks, Canoe.. it also has a washer and dryer and full size appliances you can use if you need them. It is about a mile from the actual treehouse so we just drove to the boat house. The treehouse itself has minimal kitchen space, a small mini fridge, coffee maker, etc.. but it’s plenty to work with for glorified camping. We just brought a crock pot and cooked all our meals in it and it was perfect. Or there is a small bbq grill outside. Honestly this was such a fun weekend fall getaway with the kids. We will be making another trip here for sure. The host is beyond accommodating and answers all your questions. I cannot say enough good about this little slice of paradise. Thanks again for hosting us."
2578,38,Our second time staying and it was wonderful yet again. Great fishing. The cabin has all the essentials. And Lane is super responsive and helpful. We hope to come back again soon!
2579,38,"We booked this on a whim, just to get away for the weekend. Lane’s place is a no-frills treehouse cabin right on the river, with dock and pier. There is no one around and it’s perfectly dark at night for star gazing.
The treehouse itself is more than adequate. With two futons and bunk bed, we all had a place to lay our head. There’s a sink and toilet in the treehouse, along with microwave and small fridge for necessities. Don’t bring a hair dryer or flat iron, as it is run off solar power and can’t handle the load. There is an outdoor shower with hot water, which I can’t imagine would be ideal when it’s cold. But it’s there if you need it. Lane provided lots of wood for the campfire and a brand new Weber grill, perfect for spending time outdoors. The screened porch with rockers was very nice for coffee in the morning. Bring your own towels and sheets or sleeping bags. It’s more of a glamping experience than a stay in a standard cabin. We enjoyed kayaking on the pond, which was included in the rental fee and there is a boat house with a kitchen and full bathroom. Thank you Lane!"
2580,38,"We had a great time celebrating my son’s birthday at the treehouse. We explored the trails, kayaked, and fishes. Lane was an attentive host who answered all of my questions, as well as giving us great suggestions of restaurants and local places to check out!"
2581,38,Our stay was amazing... we really enjoyed the atmosphere and the fishing.
2582,38,"The cabin was clean and neat. The land was what shined here. Private space, private dock overlooking the river, plenty of shade. The screened in porch was amazing. It was exactly the experience we were looking for."
2583,38,Great place
2584,38,We have stayed here before and will continue to stay here once or twice a year as a good family getaway that’s close to home!
2585,38,"We'll definitely be back! This place was a perfect getaway. It was about .25-.5 miles away from any other visitor, down a dirt road, surrounded by trees and right on the river. Although private, it was still only 5 minutes to town. Not only was the inside spotless, but even everything outside was - the outdoor chairs, the patios, the porch, the grass was cut so we could enjoy the yard, everything was well kempt - it doesn't sound like a big deal, but it was so nice to not have to clean everything off before using. Nothing was neglected here! One thing to note: do not come here in the middle of the summer expecting to cool off in the river (especially if you have a dog that will need to cool off). There is no way to get it and turns out, you don't want to get in because of the strong undercurrent. Luckily there is a very nice outdoor shower that my pup and I cooled off in throughout the day. We'll definitely be back during the fall or spring. We loved it here!"
2586,40,if you like outdoors it's perfect. Owners were very helpful. would absolutely stay again. phone service is spotty but they do have wifi.
2587,40,"Beautiful place, very peaceful and the hosts are the most wonderful and helpful people!"
2588,40,We loved it and will be back again
2589,40,"The hosts were very responsive and super friendly. Even during a holiday they still were available to assist us when we had questions and minor issues with the hot tub getting it started.

The home was very inviting and spacious enough. We enjoyed many of the amenities on the property, and truly had a wonderful Thanksgiving holiday.

You can tell a lot of love was put in this home."
2590,40,Thanks Diana! So glad to hear You enjoyed your stay. Yes indeed we have put a lot of love into all our cabins! Come back and stay with us again!
2591,40,"This was our first time staying at a airbnb and won't be our last. We are already talking about using Dale and Rocio again. We appreciated they let us have our dog babies with us.
We will be taking memories home with us."
2592,40,"This place is absolutely amazing! The hosts were wonderful to communicate with and answered back promptly. There is so much to do at this cabin, fishing, Cornhole, horse shoes, and Elizabethtown is just 10 minutes away, White Lake 25 minutes away, Kure Beach a little over an hours away. This is a great location to either just relax or stay busy."
2593,40,Peaceful and relaxing. Great place for a family to enjoy time with each other by the river.
2594,40,Very nice and relaxing. As advertised. Very clean and nice amenities.
2595,40,..
2596,40,"The house was nice and clean and the location was great. The hosts have a lot of rules, which is fine just be prepared for that. The linen situation is a little different but all in all the house and host are nice."
2597,40,Very beautiful home. Very well taken care of. Everything was as stated in the review posted by Dale and Rocio. Was very relaxing and had a great stay. Would rent again.
2598,40,The home is accurately described. If you enjoy nature you will love this home. The multi level decks are a pleasure to enjoy while sipping coffee in the morning or a cocktail in the evening. The owners were extremely responsive.
2599,40,"Myself, my Fiance, son and our dog as well as another couple, their daughter and their infant daughter all had a wonderfully relaxing stay! The cabin was easy to find and check in was a breeze! The blower in the hot tub was not working, which we were made aware of and were fine with, but Dale went above and beyond and installed a new blower while we were out sight seeing! The kitchen had every utensil and pan we needed as well as sugar and spices. We fished off the dock as well as the pond located on the dirt road as you come in and caught several catfish as well as some crappy. We enjoyed going to White Lake as well as the water park and even had some Mexican dinner in town one night. We were able to spread out and enjoy some alone time at the cabin with it being so spacious and offering so many decks and areas to relax! We would love to rent out the other cabins along with this one for a family retreat! Dale and Rocio were extremely nice and a pleasure to talk to! Bring bug spray!!! Can't wait to go back!"
2600,40,Clean enjoyable vacation spot.
2601,40,Thank you for a great family getaway!
2602,40,"Great hosts, attentive, honest, prompt and kind. My wife, kids and I loved our stay on the river and will be back next year. Cabin was nice, fishing was great and proximity to fun family activities was on point. We had a relaxing week and are sad it is over."
2603,40,Beautiful riverfront property! Relaxing quiet section of the Cape Fear River. Super nice house with great amenities! Hope to return and stay again soon. Thanks so much Dale and Rocio!
2604,40,Our group of 6 and two dogs had a great weekend at the Rivah! The outside area is way bigger than we expected! There's a cabin on both sides but they're far enough away that you still feel like you have complete privacy. The floating dock was big enough that the 6 of us sat and fished comfortably for hours down there. I do wish there were more kitchen amenities for cooking so we didn't have to bring so much but we made it work. I would also suggest bringing your own drinking water because the water at the house smells like sulfur. We would absolutely come back! Thanks for the great weekend getaway!!
2605,40,"It was such a great Mother’s Day get away! We loved all the time we spent outdoors, the shaded decks, fishing on the river, and kayaking! Such a relaxing home to stay in."
2606,40,"I’m going to be completely honest here with the good and bad. The good: the house was virtually spotless with one minor exception. The outdoor living space is gorgeous and the view is spectacular. The bad: this house was listed for $110 a night, but I ended up spending nearly $800 for 2 nights because of all the fees. $150 for my pets, an extra $100 to use the hot tub, and a $100 cleaning fee despite the fact that you are expected to clean it yourself. They were also still prepping the property when we arrived, which was after our check in time. We didn’t get inside the house until after 4:30. I also felt uncomfortable at check in. I got confronted about having two extra guests with me (in a separate vehicle because they weren’t staying). It felt invasive. This house could easily sleep 8 people. It was my wife and myself in one car and my friend and her spouse that live nearby coming for dinner. I did not feel it was something I needed to disclose. Not a very welcoming experience. Despite that, we still had a good time, but it was not how I wanted to start my very expensive weekend."
2607,40,"We are glad you liked the property and we are sorry you didn’t understand our fee schedule. Our listing is clear that pets, hot tub and linens are extra fees which provide services that are at your discretion. While our fees may seam high to you they are actually considerably cheaper than most rentals I have stayed at. As stated in our listing we do expect our guests to leave our property like they find it. Our cleaning fee covers sanitation, additional cleaning guests do not do (waxing, windows, grounds etc). I am also sorry you felt uncomfortable at checkin with additional guests questions but our property is for paying guests only and you had more guests than your stated number. Our base rent is for a maximum of 4 guests with all other guests incurring an additional fee. We try to provide the best rate we can for guests and allow them to add guests or additional amenities as they see fit. We provide a beautiful and unique property for a very reasonable rate and hope this reply will help clarify some of your concerns. We want ALL our guests to experience a great stay at our properties!"
2608,40,Really fun location and enjoyable house.
2609,40,Beautiful place to stay!
2610,40,"we had an amazing time at this beautiful cottage. It was everything we needed and more. great place to relax and unwind. got to meet Dale and we had a nice conversation and he was very friendly and welcoming, he also gave us tips for things to do in the area. I would HIGHLY recommend staying here."
2611,40,This is a great place for someone looking to get away from the city life! Only bad thing is how the water spells when turn it on but it’s nothing you can’t get use to but I LOVED THE PLACE
2612,40,The girls and I absolutely loved this place its in a great location I felt very safe It’s an awesome place for a getaway. We had no problems during our stay. It was very clean when we arrived. The owners are awesome people. I especially loved Rocio! She’s so friendly! The outdoor views are so calming. We had an awesome spring break! Would most definitely recommend!!!!
2613,40,it is a beautiful place. it was so relaxing and peaceful. they are easy to get up with if you have any questions. they are very nice and the place is very clean. we had a great trip
2614,40,"Clean, private, everything we needed."
2615,40,Amazing home and owners. Beautiful location
2616,40,Great place by the river gives you an opportunity for a stay you won’t experience in too many places. Good place to get away and do nothing but what you want.
2617,40,Wonderful place to stay!
2618,40,"This place is awesome. Great for a family vacation...the location is on point and we absolutely loved all the different deck areas...so many possibilities for all sorts of activites. I would definately book here and with Dale and Rocio again, they were really attentive and responded quickly to all of our questions. Thank you for all the great memories, we may have to make this a yearly family tradition!"
2619,40,Great place! Rightby the river. And so many places to hang out
2620,40,Great place to stay and unwind from the outside world. The house and the amenities are always top notch.
2621,40,Had a great time enjoying the peace and quiet
2622,40,Very quiet & peaceful. The cabin is outstanding . Very cleanliness. The owners are so welcoming and amazing people. Definitely a 10/10 places to visit and stay
2623,40,"Recommend highly, good fishing, great home, clean hosts and very kind and helpful"
2624,40,Beautiful place!! The Decks and outdoor living space is beyond amazing. We enjoyed our 1 year anniversary here with our Fur Babies. Dale & Chio were great . The cabin was quite & views amazing. Will definitely be back ❤
2625,40,Great place to stay 💜
2626,40,Very relaxing and great fishing experience can’t wait to go back !
2627,40,"This place is awesome! If you are looking for a place to relax, be by the river, enjoy an amazing outdoor space- this is the place. So unique, and so many things to do at the property. We enjoyed every second of it and cannot wait to be back!"
2628,40,Great place to stay and awesome views
2629,40,Once again an amazing stay!
2630,40,"I couldn't hand pick a better, more relaxing place if I tried. The space, river, etc. was fantastic."
2631,40,My group and I really enjoyed Dale’s place!
2632,40,"The views from the decks are amazing, the pictures are accurate, and the hot tub was GREAT, and the master suite downstairs was super impressive! We really enjoyed listening to a great horned owl calling out every night. Dale was very quick to respond to questions throughout the process."
2633,40,This place is quiet and beautiful! Such a nice and relaxing area with a ton of things to do. Very clean as well!
2634,40,"Dale’s Cabin is spacious but cozy, and super clean! It’s right by the river and it has a lot of open areas outside to sit and enjoy the view. Grill area is awesome! It was a great surprise to us! We enjoyed our stay so much there and our little kids had so much fun experiencing the first snow in their lives (they lived overseas most of their lives)."
2635,40,Great place great people
2636,40,Great
2637,40,Clean place with cozy furnishings in a beautiful location.
2638,40,"Came down from Canada at Christmas for a family wedding and we were so impressed by Dale and Chio’s cabin. It was even better than the pictures. With 8 adults in the place we never felt crowded as there was so much space for everyone to spread out. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone. And with the hot tub, it was the perfect end to all our busy sightseeing days. Dale even came by the second day to make sure all was good and the hot tub was working properly. Any questions we had, they responded quickly. Such a peaceful place to relax and enjoy the great outdoors.

Leone and Family"
2639,40,"A great place, definitely will be back. There were 6 of us and it rained most of the time. Hot tub, grill and lots of deck are covered and we still had a blast despite the weather. Downstairs suite is AMAZING and the other rooms were so nice and clean, the bathrooms were spotless and roomy too!"
2640,40,"Where to begin.... The house and hosts were both great. They were very responsive and the house was immaculate. We were there for a few nights as a treat to ourselves to escape the everyday hustle and bustle. This is a great place to relax by the water, fish, swim or float. The cell service was a bit spotty but we were able to connect to wifi and receive calls or text. On a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate this property a 10/10 and the hosts a 10/10 as well. Thanks for everything, looking forward to staying here again."
2641,40,"I've never written a bad review before but I feel like this is needed. This house is not what it is advertised to be at all.
They removed the crib and didn't notify us, knowing we were bringing an infant. When we messaged the host about it the wife showed up at the door a couple hours later making it clear we were an inconvenience to her. She told us they have it but we'd have to be the ones to put it back together if we wanted to use it. We ended up having to go and purchase a pack n play for our daughter.
The water smelt, looked, and tasted like it came straight from the river. It was disgusting to even bathe in. Even had things floating in it when I tried to bathe my daughter.
The house itself looked as if it had been completely neglected. Cobwebs everywhere. Things were broken and needing updating. Extremely dirty and as a result there were ants, roaches, centipedes, spiders, and rats (and yes there was rat poop on the floor). We felt gross staying in the house but unfortunately there wasn'ta whole lot of options to do around town.
The location had so much potential with the view and building itself, but unfortunately zero effort was put in to keep it nice."
2642,40,"Ashley
As my wife tried to tell you, the crib has not been listed as an aminity since hurricane Florence 3 years ago. She offered what was left of the crib if you wanted to try to put it back together or use of our fire truck bed we used for our daughter, you declined. I’m sorry that’s all we had to offer and you let that ruin your stay. As to the rest of your review we both know it’s untrue. We personally cleaned the house just before you arrived and I had personally mopped the upstairs and downstairs. We have 172 five star reviews to backup our property. It’s vindictive reviews like this one that make the review process detrimental to owners."
2643,40,"The Rivah was a lovely place to stay. We were looking for a peaceful place to relax and enjoy the site and sounds of nature, and this was perfect. We loved drinking coffee on the many decks, and cooking in the outdoor kitchen space. We had a great time fishing off the docks but decided against trying to get the canoe down the steps and into the water because it looked a bit dangerous with how steep the steps are. We would suggest bringing your own pots, pans, and cooking utensils if you like to cook (some are supplied but they are pretty beaten up and difficult to cook with). We would rent from Dale again in the future!"
2644,40,Quiet. Peaceful. Beautiful. This is only a few of the words to describe the tranquility of dale’s cabin. It was an absolutely incredible stay and anyone considering it will not be disappointed. It’s the perfect vacation spot to get away
2645,40,Dale is a great host. He was very helpful as far as things to do in the area as well as teller goodnight us the best way to catch a catfish. The row boat and canoe were so much fun. We loved being on the river. The house is beautiful and very clean. Dale is very welcoming and informative. We had a great time. We are looking forward to going back.
2646,40,"This was the second year we did a retreat at the cabin and had a wonderful time. The decks are just beautiful and such a peaceful, quiet place to relax. The location is beautiful, the owners are wonderful and there's plenty to do! Loved it!"
2647,40,Dale’s place was amazing to stay at and they offered such great amenities to make our stay that much better!
2648,40,This is a fantastic cabin like home for those who enjoy the great outdoors. There is so much deck space and areas to enjoy The home is beautifully situated right on the river and is an ideal vacation spot for those who like quiet and enjoying the tranquility of nature.
2649,40,Amazing place with a lot to do. Very secluded. Great hosts. Will definitely be back. Great way to get away and unplug with the family.
2650,40,"Great place to get away. Very clean and well kept. Hot Tub and outside grill space were first class. Beautiful porch to sit and overlook the river. Be careful during rainy season, dirt road gets extremely muddy. We look forward to returning during the Summer Season."
2651,40,The Rivahgetaway was the perfect christmas getaway. Had so much to offer. Clean and friendly welcome. Love how deep in the trees it was. So quiet and peaceful. My kids and I were going to find a Christmas tree in the woods when surprise there was one in the closet. Had everything basic you need. Definitely a great find and definitely going to come back. Ty again for allowing us to use your cabin. We were very pleased.
2652,40,"I stayed here with two colleagues for a work trip but I'd definitely come back for a nice, relaxing weekend on the river. After we booked, we were warned that the road going back to the house was in bad shape and we might get stuck... We did -- but were quickly rescued the next morning! The best way to handle a muddy situation. This house is a nice retreat."
2653,40,The house is one of a kind! Dale is very friendly.
2654,40,Great place to stay for some peace and quiet. Secluded location but also close to amenities.
2655,40,"We can not say enough. We were greeted with a tour of the home at checkin. This home is absolutely beautiful. So beautiful it made up our minds this is the memory we want for our wedding day... This house was sooo clean.. And there was so much to do there. My girls and fiancee literally were depressed the whole trip back home. This was our favorite vacation spot to date.. They only negatives we could even think of is the hill on the road made us alil nervous after it rained since we didnt have a 4 wheel drive vehichle.. And the spider webs. But its a river house thats to be expected... But I leave you with this the hosts, the home, the location this is a vacation you will not regret booking. It will be our family vacation spot yearly for now on.. This will be the vacation our girls grow up to tell their kids about. And thank the hosts enough. The wife even helped us find our lost cell phone when we were late leaving... And wasnt upset with us at all for being a little late checking out due to the phone issue. Awesome people...."
2656,40,"This listing has a few things that need to be addressed but as a whole, it’s a nice, country listing away from the stresses of life that offer the serenity of the calm river. It was so quiet, I often forgot it was there. There are other houses nearby but we were mostly alone, isolated. I’d recommend not going the first time at night as it’s a little unnerving but all in all, a fair offering for a fair price. The owners are very nice and even gave us fresh eggs!"
2657,40,if you want to get away from City life this is the place to go. Very quiet and Serene beautiful view
2658,40,"Wow!! I can’t even begin to state how beautiful this place was. We arrived quite late and the hosts were very understanding. Waking up that first morning and having coffee on that deck was really something magical. Beautiful view of the river. We fell in love. Our two girls had a blast, they didn’t want to leave. The place was clean, and everything was very accessible. We had everything we needed at our disposal. We wanted something secluded but close enough to everything and this gave us exactly that. The hosts were wonderful people, we enjoyed talking with them. Looking forward to renting again next visit!"
2659,40,This place is absolutely beautiful. Very relaxing and a great place to meditate and enjoy nature.
2660,40,"With this property, you're in for a treat. The view is gorgeous and atmosphere is peaceful. The hosts are very hospitable and go out of their way to meet guest needs. Wonderful experience!"
2661,40,"We loved our stay here! We fished off the dock and caught a cat fish, had a fire in the fire pit, played cornhole on the deck and enjoyed the river views. Checkout Cape Fear Vineyard and Winery while you're here - a great spot for dinner, complete with a petting zoo!"
2662,40,This place is so perfect. The outdoor space is phenomenal and the view is absolutely gorgeous. You are truly surrounded by nature here. Dale was absolutely wonderful and super responsive to our needs. We will definitely be back :)
2663,40,"I met up with two friends at the cabin for a weekend away. The location is absolutely gorgeous and the house was exactly what we needed for a little 'vacation from the world'. There are so many awesome amenities to choose from, several different patios to lounge and chill at, a kitchen with everything you need, and three comfortable and spacious bedrooms. And Dale is incredibly nice, hospitable and very informative.

I can see this being a great place to go with the family, with friends, or ever by yourself.

I highly recommend this fantastic cabin and plan to go back again next year for sure!"
2664,40,"Really nice home, the outdoor space is pretty awesome with multiple decks and porches. Very comfortable and would love to revisit during warmer months! Dale is very responsive and super nice host!"
2665,40,"This is a gem! 6 of us spent the weekend together before my brother-in-law left for a deployment. Its close enough to a grocery store, yet far away to feel like your in the middle of nowhere. Smores at the bonfire, fun on the river in the paddle boat and canoe, it's a great place to stay. Plus the master bath is impressive. Nice bathtub and walk-in shower.
I would recommend arriving before the sun goes down if possible because the dirt road you take to the house is not well lit.
This is great place to stay with family, we hope to all go back next year!"
2666,40,This home offers plenty of places to relax and take in the scenery. The location provides for a peaceful and serene vacation. We enjoyed sitting around the fire and relaxing in the hot tub. We had very little cellphone service so the horseshoe pits and corn hole boards were a nice touch. The hosts are very accommodating and are great at communicating any special instructions.
2667,40,This was the perfect getaway to relax! My friends and I had the best time here. The house was even better than expected and the location was perfect. It is a family friendly environment and a fully equipped home. I would highly recommend staying here if you get the chance. :)
2668,40,"This house is down a long dirt road surrounded by trees on the Cape Fear River.
There were 4 adults and we had a fantastic stay, the house is great and the outdoors even better. It is quiet the property is fantastic we played corn hole with the river going by so cool. Will visit again,"
2669,40,"What a relaxing get a away! Super quite, beautiful, wooded, riverside house. There are so many decks and private sitting areas that the pictures just can't capture it all. It was much more than we expected. Dale and his wife were very friendly and willing to help with anything we needed but the place had it all so we didn't need anything from them. We enjoyed using the paddle boat and our four year old daughter caught a bluegill while we were out across the river! I also recommend a game of bean bag toss on the super sized deck, great fun for our family! The road into the place is packed river bottom sand so wasn't an issue for us driving two cars the short 1/4 mile or so off the paved road. We hope to come back some day."
2670,40,This place was a great weekend getaway house. There were plenty of outdoor activities to do and it is truly beautiful here. The location is secluded but still close enough to town. Dale was an excellent host and we hope to come back during the summer months to fully appreciate the river.
2671,40,This is a great property to stay in. It's secluded and makes for a peaceful stay. It's surrounded by lots of natural beauty. This property had everything you could imagine needing for a comfortable stay. Not to mention that the hosts were absolutely lovely people.
2672,40,Dale was very helpful and accommodating. Plenty of outdoor amenities for a great weekend getaway. Would recommend to others looking to have a fun time on the river.
2673,40,Dale and his wife were lovely. The cabin was wonderful. Location was quiet and beautiful. We had a relaxing time and this was just what we were looking for! Thanks so much for hosting.
2674,40,There place was great and very good host very helpful with anything that was needed would definitely stay here again
2675,40,Thank you Tim for taking care of our place!
2676,40,"If you're looking for a remote place to get away without having to ""rough it"" too much, this is the place. It's pretty, clean and well-equipped. The many decks around the house are lovely. We built a fire in the fire pit and sat under the stars. The grilling area was a great plus!"
2677,40,"Beautiful place, spacious and roomy! It was a great place."
2678,40,"Dale and Ricio were fantastic hosts! They were kind enough to lend us their truck for the weekend so we could make it up to the cabin and they were very communicative. The cabin is comfortable and has great outdoor space. The decks were incredibly spacious and had the weather cooperated, would have loved to enjoy them more! We also appreciated the outdoor grill, the fire pit and access to the canoe. We enjoyed our stay and hope to return during warmer weather."
2679,40,"Dale and his wife were wonderful hosts! Very accommodating to us. There was heavy rain from some bad storms which made the path in very muddy, they took the time to ensure we had transportation that could travel on the road, if not they were going to help to ensure we made it to the cabin. Overall the cabin was in great shape, clean and well maintained. My wife and I enjoyed the many offerings the cabin had - we would differently go back again. Thanks again Dale!"
2680,40,"Dear Steve,
So glad to know you enjoyed your time at our cabin. Thank you for taking care of our property as if it was yours. We will be glad to have you back."
2681,40,"Rivahgetaway was the halfway point on our road trip from MA to FL. We hit some unexpected traffic on the way and ended up arriving 5 hours later than we intended. Dale was very easy to get in touch with, as well as very accommodating to our schedule change.
The interior of the house was very clean with a nice floor plan, and the comfy patio furniture and deck were perfect after a day of driving. The master bath down stairs was also very nice. We were sorry we didn't get to spend more time there!
"
2682,40,We enjoyed having you and your family at our property. Thank you Jamie for taking care of our property as if it was yours. Hope you had an enjoyable holiday time in Florida. We would love to have you back when you can stay longer.
2683,41,"I loved the dome home, immediately felt at peace. Felt connected to the surroundings and it’s 100% worth the experience."
2684,41,10/10 would stay again!
2685,41,The land this dome is on is quite beautiful. We enjoyed a peaceful holiday weekend here. Our gracious host recommended a couple nearby hikes. We ended up hiking at the Bailey Mountain Preserve; a very nice area and a great work out. I would absolutely recommend this stay for anyone who wants to get away from the city but still wants a bit of comfort.
2686,41,"Great stay, very tranquil and relaxing"
2687,41,"Such a beautiful location!! It was the perfect place to just remember the goodness in life. My partner and I were amazed at the raw beauty of the location and even though there is another place on the property it feels very private! I would definitely recommend coming in the daylight for check in if it is your first time. Bring some fire starters and kindling if you aren’t great at building fires, and get ready for a lowkey and gorgeous stay! Will definitely be back again!"
2688,41,"Excellent communication throughout.
Exactly as described."
2689,41,Bed is a little concave but it was a beautiful space and stay and the outdoor shower was awesome!!
2690,41,I just bought a brand new mattress!
2691,41,We had a wonderful time! The scenery is beautiful!
2692,41,Great getaway for you and you’re significant other.
2693,41,"We had a BLAST! Nice and secluded, but close to everything had everything we needed. The hostess was very gracious and nice."
2694,41,"There was no rug like the pictures, the bed drooped in the middle & the sheets smelled a bit. It was still extremely peaceful and we had a nice stay, but different than expected."
2695,41,I'm sorry to hear that! I'll go through the sheets to find ones that got musty in the laundry. And plan to get a new mattress for next season.
2696,41,"Beautiful location, still close to Asheville but very private"
2697,41,"Unique and serene stay in a beautiful part of the state, close to Asheville and tons of nature."
2698,41,"The dome was gorgeous and the views were better. It was a cozy space to relax and celebrate. It had everything we needed and more. I highly recommend the outdoor shower experience, it was awesome! It rained almost the whole time we were there but it made the view so green and vibrant. The sound of the rain and the fungi on the deck rails were some highlights for us."
2699,41,Great
2700,41,"A must stay experience. The view was fantastic and the dome was comfortable for us 2 humans and our 2 dogs. They absolutely loved being able to explore and run the land. Definitely read the guest book, there is some awesome stuff in there from past visitors."
2701,41,We had an amazing stay at the dome home! It’s a very cool spot with picturesque views and more amenities than we were expecting for somewhat “roughing it”. It was a really unique experience. Highly recommend!
2702,41,Wonderful stay.
2703,41,"Thanks Leona, I'm glad you liked it.
We took down the roof piece this winter and washed and painted it, so, at this point it's just a dirt stain :)"
2704,41,"Loved our night in the domehouse, surrounded by nature. Enjoyed an evening fire and some stargazing ✨ Highly recommend staying here!"
2705,41,Such a fun destination. Really was a nice getaway in the mountains. Would highly recommend!
2706,41,Very relaxing stay!
2707,41,"WOW!!! What a spectacular location! The dome home was a magical experience for my partner and I. We loved exploring the woods around us, and saw countless butterflies during our stay (especially swallowtails)! Pictures don’t do this place justice!! It was comfortable, easy, and peaceful. Thank you Motherwood!!!!"
2708,41,"What an amazing stay. Beautiful view, very relaxing. Highly recommend."
2709,41,"Calm, peaceful, beautiful grounds for weekend retreat in nature. Will be back!"
2710,41,A very cool experience!!!!!
2711,41,"10/10 recommend, safe, peaceful. However beware of the critters"
2712,41,"Amazing, beautiful experience I will never forgot and I’m dying to go back again!"
2713,41,Calming and enjoyable
2714,41,Beautiful space!!! Definitely a spot I would return to for a good mental reset and a slow down.
2715,41,"The land this place is on is amazing! We woke up and watched the fog roll over the mountains! She was right, don’t show up after dark on your first night!!"
2716,41,"I""m glad you found it! Yes the dome is tricky on a dark night. The other rental, Hobbithenge, is easy to find."
2717,41,Great space with beautiful views! We loved it.
2718,41,"Wonderful stay in a beautiful, clean, welcoming, natural place. Feels fantastic here. Watched shooting stars and listened to chorus of owls. Highly recommend! Does get very warm during the heat of summer days."
2719,41,"Yes its really toasty from about noon till 6 in July in August inside when it's not raining. During those times, plan to be out exploring, or hanging out on the little porch or the nearby yoga deck, or can borrow the outdoor kitchen from the hobbit guests, where there are outlets, as long as you don't use their dishes."
2720,41,This place is incredible!! Keeping the camping feeling with a touch of glamping. Way more than expected was provided for us. The fireflies love the area. This place is like a fantasy. 10/10 would recommend!
2721,41,Enjoyed my stay! Loved the peace and quiet.
2722,41,"Amazing, rejuvenating spot!! Our second time here and will return!"
2723,41,"This dome is a must visit for anyone who needs to take a breather from their day-to-day lives and reconnect with themselves and nature.

The location is perfect, and there you are ideally situated for hiking in the Blue Ridge Mountains and a short trip away from the Smoky Mountains, as well.

The sunrises and sunsets were spectacular to witness at this beautiful spot.

I left here feeling refreshed and rejuvenated after the passing of my Dad. Nature and this area's energy really helped with healing and re-righting my spirit."
2724,41,"A really interesting stay! Very cool space, just as advertised. Like the listing says, this is essentially camping, so only come if you are prepared for that!"
2725,41,"Motherwood looked exactly like the pictures - clean, secluded, and beautiful. We enjoyed being able to come to a place for some much-needed rest and relaxation!"
2726,41,Wow! The views at this place are breath taking! If you’re looking for a mountain escape while still being close to the city this is it! We had a great time.
2727,41,Our stay in the dome home was great. The location is beautiful. Great place to be naked in nature. very relaxing and peaceful.
2728,41,"Unique spot about 25 mins from Asheville! Cooled down quite a bit at night which was terrific, but was extremely hot earlier in the day so be prepared for that! Nice change up from your typical stay, with beautiful views and quite a bit of privacy. I would definitely recommend!"
2729,41,Beautiful view and a wonderful place to stay! Definitely recommend :)
2730,41,Relaxing places to disconnect and re-energize from day to day lives. Recommend for people wants camping with minimal effort.
2731,41,The Dome was wonderful. I loved the location and the view was great. Tucked away from the hustle and bustle but close enough to Asheville to make it super convenient! I definitely recommend and look forward to staying again. 5/5!
2732,41,Beautiful property! Short drive to downtown Asheville. The dome was clean and exactly as described. Definitely recommend!
2733,41,"Unsure of when the last guest stayed, but the cleanliness was not to our standards.
We have done our fair share of wilderness escapades and roughing it, but this was advertised as a “glamping experience” and that’s not at all what we walked into.
The dome has so much potential, and maybe it just fell through for our stay, but between the lack of cleanliness throughout the dome, and lack of care for the outdoor area, we left as soon as possible."
2734,41,"As I made clear to Clair, we had a tragic situation where I had to let the cleaners go because they didn't work out, so for revenge they decided to stop cleaning without telling me. So it ddn't get cleaned. Clair received a full refund. It's puzzling why someone would receive a refund, understand that there were extraordinary circumstances, and still leave a bad review, but some people are just like that, I guess. Sad."
2735,41,"Off the grid done right! You’ll 100% find your zone in the dome home - I feel like I could write Walden here ✍️ If in need of a creative breakthrough, this place will birth it ⚠️ Note of caution, don’t expect the cleanest experience… I know we’re in nature, all is one, we’re interdimensional beings, and dirt don’t hurt - but keep it clean for the airbnb ✨Even if the cleaning fee is low 😂"
2736,41,"I'm glad you felt creative! So sorry, wish you had let us know that it hadn't been cleaned!! We had just let the work traders go, as it wasn't working out, so to get revenge, they stopped cleaning and didn't tell me! Apologies. A difficult transition."
2737,41,Thank you for letting us stay. We had such a peaceful time. Loved it
2738,41,"Wonderful area, great if you need to catch up on sleep it’s so peaceful and quite."
2739,41,"needs improvement all round, needs new sheets and furniture, there old. most importantly needs safe heating."
2740,41,"All the furniture is less than a year old. The couch is floppy but clean and very comfortable! The style is not modern .. it's rustic. The heating is perfectly safe. This guest turned on the gas heater wrong, though it's very easy to use, and smelled gas since she didn't light the pilot light. So she wanted her money back and was mad when she didn't get it. But the heating is perfectly safe, has been used for 5 years without any incidents. Please be able to use a propane heater (the instructions are on it) or a wood stove if you visit this place during the cold season."
2741,41,"Absolutely beautiful view, the pictures don’t do it justice. The outside shower, which has hot water and was very comfortable, was so fun. I’ve never seen so many butterflies. Honestly wish I had been able to spend more time outside just enjoying the scenery and nature noises"
2742,41,"We absolutely had the best time imaginable, didn’t want to leave. Being from Jersey we are not use to seeing so many stars, it was mesmerizing..beautiful accommodation can’t wait to come back!"
2743,41,Absolutely amazing! Please go! I needed a little break from reality and to focus on myself and this was definitely the best for that. Thank you Motherwood for sharing this home with us!
2744,41,"The property is absolutely gorgeous. We stayed in hobbit henge, which is just as pictured and so cozy. Sitting by a campfire, all lights off, looking at the stars every night was very refreshing. A view unlike any other. A great place to reconnect with your partner and disconnect from technology. An overall amazing experience, we’ll definitely be coming back!"
2745,41,Can’t say enough good things about the dome. I loved it. Thanks Motherwood!
2746,41,"This land is beautiful, and the dome is the perfect mix of nature and comfort. Definitely recommend this
Airbnb to anyone looking to wake up to a stunning view!"
2747,41,"Near town, with a far-away feel. Ideal for an ultra-comfortable camping style experience and reconnecting with self, other, and nature."
2748,41,Absolutely beautiful. Highly recommend
2749,41,A beautiful stay! The view was amazing and the bed was super comfy. Definitely will be back :)
2750,41,A wonderful outdoors experience. Staying in the dome home is essentially staying in a fancy tent but it is so worth the stay. The view from the dome is breathtaking and you can watch the sun rise and set over the mountains. the only thing is that the wifi comes from this little box in the dome and not from the outdoor kitchen. It took us a long time to figure out what the wifi came from
2751,41,"Perfect spot for a weekend getaway. The dome was so cool and unique. Even though the temperature was in the 20s in the night during our stay, the wood stove kept us warm throughout the night. It was very peaceful and relaxing."
2752,41,What a magical place to feel so in touch with nature! My partner and I had an experience I’ll never forget. I would highly recommend this stay if you’re looking to be surrounded with peace
2753,41,Great place to unplug and unwind.
2754,41,"Loved the stay, first of many I hope"
2755,41,"Motherhood was absolutely a great stay! My best friend and I came from Florida just for the experience and it was absolutely worth it! Not just is the scenery so beautiful but there’s so much open trails to walk through! We went down the mountain LITERALLY into the creek from the dome. You can feel the great energy inside of the dome and fortunately for the time of the yr we went, we didn’t have to deal with any bugs. Definitely prepare for a COLD refreshing shower outside! If there was anything we would recommend, just an occasional power wash inside the dome on the ceiling. When it does get humid at night you have water that’ll drip on you while sleeping( it was expected with the humidity ) I had a few instances where it hit my face and mouth, and with the ceiling of the Dome being a bit moldy, it was gross lol other than That, absolutely beautiful! Definitely take the advice the Host gives with NOT arriving at night. We got lost and ended up arriving at night and it was pitch black lol Fortunately the host had someone come and help guide us right away & very great communication! We absolutely plan to come back and recommend 100%!!!"
2756,41,"Thank you! We're working on the ceiling .. going to have to move everything out in order to power wash it, so it's going to have to wait until the end of the season."
2757,41,Great little getaway spot. Shower is very very cold so be prepared. Nice little land around it to hike and a great location to hit popular spots near Denver.
2758,41,This is such a beautiful place. The perfect place to get away from the world. I recommend this place for sure!
2759,41,really fun spot! was a great chance to get away from everything and recenter
2760,41,This place was amazing as I’m sure others write! I enjoyed it very much
2761,41,"The best Airbnb I have stayed in , in years! Such a soul bonding experience, the property had the best views, and was so nicely cleaned! Also had really cool fun books to look at and enjoy :D ✌🏼🍄"
2762,41,"We brought headlamps for walking around at night...definitely need those.

What a great and cozy getaway!"
2763,41,I love this land and will always be grateful for the peace that it gives me each time that I visit.
2764,41,"The dome was exactly what we hoped it would be. it was a great experience, and we'll definitely be back in the summer!"
2765,41,"Simple, comfortable, and serene space. Can’t wait to visit again."
2766,41,"Motherwood’s place was lovely! Almost like upscale camping! It was a pretty rainy time, but we still got to enjoy the quiet, and a nice fire. A great stay for anyone looking to get off the grid!"
2767,41,Beautiful location and great communication!
2768,41,The host took care of all of our needs
2769,41,"Definitely one of my favorite stays ever! If you read the description in entirety, it’s exactly what the experience says it is. It was magical and exceeded our expectations with all that it had to offer. It was a pleasant surprise to find an induction cooktop + coffee maker, along with spices/silverware/cookware, string lights and books! Shower was cold as mentioned but surprisingly one of my favorite parts of the experience. One of the most beautiful places I’ve ever seen, the dome clear plastic facing the scenery was hard to see through the first night and a little dirty, but wiping it off in the morning when it’s covered in dew made it look brand new again :) My only wish is that I could we could have stayed longer! Can’t wait to come back."
2770,41,Lovely dome and great getaway!
2771,41,The perfect Labor Day Weekend getaway! Close enough to Asheville for a nice date night out and then right back to the woods to escape.
2772,41,"Beautiful place. The location was convenient to Asheville but also to many hikes, waterfalls etc. The outdoor shower was great 👍"
2773,41,Expect to feel so relaxed!
2774,41,Such a pretty area with lots of flowers. We had a nice stay and enjoyed hiking nearby. The view was nice and it was cool to just be away for awhile. A prettier comfier alternative to tent camping.
2775,41,"Beautiful place to stay, while still close to Asheville. This is such an amazing place to stay if you're looking to reconnect with nature or simply try something new!"
2776,41,"We absolutely loved this stay and highly recommend to outdoor lovers!
Amazing mountain and meadow views. Directions were concise and clear. Our stay was very comfortable. We loved the well water and the outside shower was extremely cold, yet refreshing.
We would love to stay here again in the future!!"
2777,41,Great stay - hope to do it again! Don’t worry about the no A/C aspect…. I was slightly concerned at first but the fan was great plus it cooled down quickly at night. Would recommend to visit to those inquiring :)
2778,41,We loved the dome home! The perfect little retreat with close proximity to everything Asheville has to offer. It is the most unique AirBnb I have ever stayed in and had everything we needed to enjoy our rustic stay.
2779,41,"We booked the Dome Home on a whim, and it COMPLETELY paid off! I've never seen anything like it -- it's a once in a lifetime stay for an excellent value. If you're put off by the outhouse & the outdoor shower, it's true that this might not be for you... Otherwise, though, I highly recommend!"
2780,41,The energy in the dome really is something you can’t miss and the property is absolutely beautiful
2781,41,"Thiss space is truly stunning and everything I had ever wanted in a unique and mind-clearing airbnb. Unfortunately, my stay was cut short due to a personal emergency and my partner and I needed to leave on short notice.
But what we were able to experience was wonderful and everything I had hoped for with the dome. The walk to the dome was easy from the lot and the wifi and fan availabile in the dome allowed me to communicate effectively with the host and cooled the space down easily without any issues. The view from the dome was stunning but the real gift this area gives is the view right when you turn towards the hobbit home from the driveway. It was absolutely breathtaking and I will definitely be staying with motherwood either in the dome or in the hobbit house for my next visit. I cannot recommend this place enough. Truly a gift to be able to experience the earth and nature all around the dome.
Bonus: the area is rich in fireflies/lightning bugs and I hadn't seen that many since I was a child. ❤"
2782,41,"Staying at the dome was definitely an experience! What a cool place in such an awesome wild setting. The outdoor shower was COLDDD, but at least it was there! Only criticisms: a screen, working hot plate, and clean coffee maker would’ve made our stay 5star!"
2783,41,"Thanks! I'm so sorry, I didn't know the hot plate was broken, I will replace and clean the coffee maker better!"
2784,41,Definitely a gem! Highly recommend experiencing the dome house.
2785,41,"Thank you Motherwood for allowing us to stay here. The dome was absolutely beautiful and relaxing, definitely will be returning."
2786,41,This is a great outdoor place a lot more spacious than it looks the walk Over was beautiful and easy definitely recommend.
2787,41,"If you're looking for a chance to getaway and be at peace in nature, this is exactly the place you're looking for! My friend and I gazed at the stars, journaled and made art while rain fell on the dome, and woke up early to watch the sunrise in the field. It is truly such an experience to stay at the dome. The dome itself was very cozy, clean, and not hard to find!"
2788,41,"Our stay in the dome was so exciting! The bed was extremely comfortable. A bit warm and humid inside when we got there, but after opening the door and windows it cooled down as the sun went down."
2789,41,I'm glad you enjoyed it. It is extremely hot on hot afternoons but cools down quick once you open the flaps. It's never hot after 6 pm.
2790,41,"The tent is rustic, and no longer brand new, but still really awesome. We had a wonderful stay and enjoyed the property immensely. Would definitely recommend and look forward to checking out the Hobbit House."
2791,41,very beautiful place
2792,42,"This AirBnb experience was exceptional! Our main goals were to unwind and focus on writing, and this rental provided the perfect environment. The abundance of natural light and breathtaking lake view from the deck made it feel like paradise. Additionally, the bed was incredibly comfortable, ensuring that we got the rest we needed.

Cameron and Courtney, the hosts, were highly responsive and it was evident that they take great pride in their property. The kitchen was impressively stocked, which was especially appreciated by my partner who is a chef. As for myself, finding cold beer mugs in the freezer was the cherry on top!

We are already planning to return on a monthly basis, and I hope we won't have to compete for availability with other eager renters! Overall, an amazing experience that exceeded our expectations."
2793,42,"This place was exactly as described - clean, quiet, pet-friendly, beautiful views. Super fun time just being with family, snuggling on the couch and making good food. We will definitely return!"
2794,42,"Really loved our stay. Just the right amount of peace and quiet, and Hillsborough is not too far away. Try the winery up the road - that is fun! Bed was super comfortable, and we had everything we needed."
2795,42,"Great stay, beautiful location with great craftsmanship on the guest house build"
2796,42,"My boyfriend needed to work from home while we were here. I specifically asked if they had hi speed internet since he needs to do face time meetings, and he had an important job interview. They said yes it was compatible for working from home. Maybe it is in their main house 50 feet away. But when we got there, the speed was 1 or 2 at best. When it should be over 100. I don’t know a lot about that stuff, but bf said it’s dsl, which is the worst kind of internet. So I don’t recommend if you need to do any computer work. It ruined our trip. The overwhelming smell of perfumed laundry detergent was on all the towels and sheets. I am sensitive to perfumes, it gave me a constant headache. Unscented should be used. The washing machine was mildewy smelling also. I even washed out the detergent area on the machine. Anything I washed had an awful smell. The location on the lake was beautiful tho. Very peaceful right on the lake. But I will not be staying here again."
2797,42,Beautiful place. Will definitely be back
2798,42,"Perfect stay. One of our new favorites, so quiet and peaceful, absolutely loved the space, perfectly appointed and the view is amazing. Only 15 minutes to Hillsborough but feels like being in the country. Will definitely be back. Loved our stay."
2799,42,"Was very clean, well appointed. Very quiet and private. It was everything shown in the listing."
2800,42,We had the most peaceful getaway at Cameron’s lake house! We enjoyed the kayaks and our pup had plenty of grass to run around. We had the best food in Mebane and Hillsborough! We will definitely be back
2801,42,"I’ve never booked an AirBnB before and after staying here for a few days let’s just say that my expectations for all other AirBnBs are a lot higher now!

I needed a place to disconnect and get away from the fast pace lifestyle and this place was perfect for just that. Something about watching the sun rise from behind the lake and hearing the geese come out onto the water while eating breakfast and reading a book made me feel like the main character in a movie haha and I loved it! For sure will return again sometime this year.

Kitchen (house in general actually) is crazy stocked up! Exceeded my expectations! Had things that even I don’t own in my house. All you need to bring is things to do and groceries. Simple as that! 1000% worth it."
2802,42,Beautiful light and airy space in a tranquil environment. Lots of outdoor space as well. Wonderfully comfortable bed and lots of amazing blankets. Fully equipped kitchen.
2803,42,We loved our stay. It was peaceful and just the relaxing weekend that I needed. I was so impressed with the responsiveness of Cameron. Thank you!
2804,42,The place was absolutely tranquil and serene! We had a great time being in peace. We’ll most definitely be back to stay with warmer weather to enjoy the lake. Two thumbs up for the honeycomb hide out 😊
2805,42,"We rented this Airbnb as a maternity photoshoot location and it was perfect! Beautiful, clean, comfortable and dog friendly. Highly recommend!"
2806,42,Great stay and very beautiful
2807,42,"Beautiful location and interior design. Hosts are responsive and helpful.

The only thing is the internet is not the best. We were able to stream Netflix with only a few pauses, but I had trouble with video calling for an interview.

Overall a very enjoyable stay."
2808,42,"Amazing place!!! I absolutely loved everything. Decorations on point, the location was beautiful, and so private! If you need a get away to a lake house, this is the place. The kitchen is to die for, it’s so nice to cooking and just relax. Wi-Fi can be a bit slow but hey it’s a place to disconnect. And don’t miss the sunsets and sunrise in the morning with some nice coffee. So worth it!!!! ❤️❤️❤️"
2809,42,Cameron was always very responsive to any questions I had. The place was very peaceful and quiet. Great for a quick getaway.
2810,42,Very peaceful! Great Lake to view! Clean inside and cute decor. Did not provide Pam/Oil so we did our best for cooking. Would stay there again for a summer retreat!
2811,42,"Great place! Matches the description and everything is incredibly clean when you get there. Incredible kitchen supplies for an Airbnb. The kayaks were a lot of fun to take out too. We also needed to change our date, and they were quick to approve the change. Very responsive when we had a question once we checked in. I'd highly recommend staying here!"
2812,42,"If you are looking for a relaxing stay , do not hesitate to book this home. This home was everything we wanted plus more. I love the spaciousness of the unit along with all of the great amenities. The home is very secluded and only a short drive to the city. I would highly recommend this home."
2813,42,"Everything was great, clean beautiful and artsy . Don’t hesitate to book"
2814,42,Very comfortable and clean. No complaints at all. We had a great experience.
2815,42,Fantastic hosts.
2816,42,Great place
2817,42,This was absolutely the best place I have ever stayed. Truly a gem. Beautiful sunsets
2818,42,Great stay with a great view! Cameron was accommodating when it came to getting there a little earlier and easy to communicate with. Even with the other house connected to the driveway it never felt like anyone was around. Would highly recommend!
2819,42,We had a great stay! The kitchen is well stocked and the home is very comfortable. We enjoyed our last minute getaway!
2820,42,"Cute, clean and relaxing! Beautiful sunrises and starry nights! A quiet Thanksgiving is just what our family needed. ❤️"
2821,42,"The stay was amazing, with a breathtaking view. It was a much needed stress relieving vacation for my husband’s birthday, so peaceful! Cameron was a gracious host with great communication. Would love to come back in the summer!"
2822,42,Great communication and an easy check-in/out for a clean place in a peaceful location.
2823,42,"Very nice loft in a beautiful area! Cameron's communication was great, and my son and husband appreciated a clean place to call home for a few days while hunting."
2824,42,So calm and clean!
2825,42,"My husband and two doggies loved staying here! Beautiful view, total peace, and felt like lots of privacy. The kayaks were such a fun addition, especially because this is something we normally have to schedule and rent with a kayak company, so it was cool to have built in access to them - I wish we had a longer stay to use multiple times. We would block the top of the deck stairs off with a large dog crate so our dogs could bask in the sun while we sat out there, and we loved walking around the property and up and down the dock as much as our dogs did! Easy self check in and always quick to respond to messages leading up to our trip and after. 30 min but super easy drive into Durham, and about 15 minutes to a lovely market with locally sourced foods and some yummy restaurants in Hillsborough."
2826,42,"We loved our little weekend getaway! The home is so cozy, very clean & exactly how pictured. The lake view was gorgeous & porch-sitting while looking at the beautiful autumn leaves was so lovely :) Would definitely recommend this stay to anyone looking for serenity and a calm environment. Thanks, Cameron! :)"
2827,42,Amazing space and view. Definitely recommend and will visit again
2828,42,"Pictures are accurate to the place you are staying. everything was very clean and tidy. it was a beautiful view. it's close enough to everything (stores, shopping centers, etc) while still being very secluded. everyone that lives around the rental were very nice as well. we took our dog and he loved the large yard, along with being able to walk around without worry of getting hurt by cars or anything. 10/10 place to go, especially if you need a quiet place to recharge. if I have the chance, I would love to stay here again."
2829,42,We loved the open concept cottage and Kitchen. The views of the lake are beautiful and the cottage is nicely decorated! We will definitely come back to visit again soon!
2830,42,"If anyone wants to find a getaway in a relaxing, comfortable atmosphere with a great view, this is it!
Great hosts!"
2831,42,"Cameron's home and his hosting were superb in every respect. The home was in pristine condition. The lake in the back belonged on the front of a magazine (of course we weren't there when the remnants of Hurricane Ian hit), the care, to the smallest detail, was provided us with possible forgotten toiletry items available to us. This would be a perfect spot for a couple or single individual wanting to get away from the hustle and bustle of city living and traffic jams- all with 30 minutes of Durham. You rock, Cameron!"
2832,42,"I had a hard deadline for two of my programs and my daughter needed to be in a creative space to work on her next film. We both needed a change of scenery that would allow us to focus. We decided to use Cameron's lake location to provide us the creative space we needed for our work-cation. We were a little disappointed that the outdoor seating is not as pictured. I think it's important to know you will need to switch to wi-fi calling to make/receive calls. The internet is not terrible but may drop periodically. Cameron is a wonderful host and he is very accommodating. Cameron added a small table/chair for me to work on. The place is beautiful, calming, and has everything you could need. If it doesn't I am sure Cameron will get it for you!"
2833,42,"Perfect spot for 2 and a dog. Cameron came thru with a generator the morning after Tropical Storm Ian blew through with a vengeance. The view over the lake is perfect. Extremely private, very clean and that sofa is soooo comfortable as is the bed."
2834,42,"We found this listing and decided to try it based on the terrific photos online. It was exactly as advertised and would definitely recommend. Quiet, charming, clean and well equipped. It is much better than any hotel accommodations."
2835,42,Everything was as described. We loved our stay there! The place is very clean and well-kept! I highly recommended this place to everyone who wants to enjoy some peace and quiet with a nice view!
2836,42,very relaxing and beautiful the house was beautiful and clean.
2837,42,"This place is a perfect couples retreat! Not too far outside of the city, but feels like the perfect spot to unwind in nature. Pet friendly so the pups also get to enjoy wide open land and a lake to swim in! I will say that we weren’t expecting the water level to be so low, below the level of the dock, so if you’re going soon, just enjoy the other wonderful features this place has to offer. Pleasant surprise, they had 2 kayaks instead of 1 available to us!"
2838,42,"This isn’t a large place but we found it to be extremely clean as well as comfortable. Cameron was wonderful about answering questions when they popped up. It was great sitting out on the porch / deck just enjoying the peace & quiet, especially the sun set & sun rise.
We also enjoyed going into Hillsbrough and checking out the stores, especially the hardware store."
2839,42,"Very nice house. Cameron is very friendly, accommodating, and easy to communicate with. Very happy with my stay!"
2840,42,Such a fun getaway! We loved this place.
2841,42,"I booked Cameron’s place for a retreat before a major writing deadline. It was exactly what I needed—extremely quiet for focus and se-stressing, clean and simple. Since I’m writing about cemeteries, I enjoyed the short walk over to the historic Eno Cemetery, which is beautiful! Bald eagles flying over the house were great too."
2842,42,"This was the CUTEST air bnb we’ve ever stayed in, not to mention the coziness of it!"
2843,42,"This was a lovely hideaway, in a great location. Very relaxing. Great views from the deck to the lake. The place was clean, well stocked and easy to check in. Would highly recommend."
2844,42,"Had a wonderful, relaxing stay at Cam’s place while visiting a sick relative. The apartment is perfectly situated on the water in a rural and peaceful part of NC while only a short drive to quaint Hillsborough. I especially appreciated the decor/ambiance, loved the deck and enjoyed the comfortable mattress and high quality linens. Will definitely be back!"
2845,42,This was a lovely place to stay for a couple nights! Would recommend!
2846,42,Don’t think twice. Booked this place you will love it. Courtney and Cameron house is beautiful.
2847,42,"I’ve been to many airbnbs across this world; this is one of the best I have EVER stayed in. The price and value is the best I’ve ever seen for the size of the house. Additionally, the lake is BEAUTIFUL!!! You have private access via the dock and it’s perfect for tanning, swimming!! Cannot everstate how private of a lake is, located within a small community but we didn’t see a single person on the lake the entire time we were there; so peaceful. The kayaks were great quality, and the kitchen had everything you needed to cook. The house looks brand new, like it was built yesterday!! Beautiful shower and bathroom, everything was super clean. For laundry there are washer dryer that look brand new with all the detergent and everything you need!

30 minutes to the main town, 15 minutes from hillsborough, a cute little town with thrift shop and restaurants!"
2848,42,This is a great relaxing airbnb!
2849,42,"What a wonderful spot. Quiet and peaceful! Lots of sunshine and brightness to welcome you during your stay! We stayed for a few days and loved the scenery. Although we had some very hot weather, the inside of the apartment was cozy and cool and just what we needed to relax!"
2850,42,"This is a beautiful place with gorgeous views, stylish accommodations and all the amenities to make you comfortable! The hosts were excellent with communication, flexible with our pets (the dogs loved the ducks!), and gave us our privacy! Will be back again!!"
2851,42,The loft was Amazing and so was the view! The stay was very peaceful perfect get away from a big city!
2852,42,Five Stars across the board. Adorable little place with everything you need. Excellent host communication. Quiet and relaxing. Just what we needed.
2853,42,So clean and pretty view
2854,42,"I highly recommend staying here if you need a good recharge. If you want to shop a little or want to grab a bite to eat, Hillsborough is a great town to check out and its only 10min down the road. The lake is beautiful, quiet and private. My wife and I decided to try our hand at fishing (bring your tackle, its worth it!) from their kayaks and were able to snag a couple bass. We loved every second and wish we stayed longer. Cant wait to come back!"
2855,42,We really enjoyed our stay here. It’s a beautiful location and felt very private and relaxing.
2856,42,Nice quiet place for a long weekend stay.
2857,42,We had the best time staying here. The loft apartment is so cozy and has beautiful views of the lake. The time and attention given to every little amenity and decoration was evident and we felt right at home. Awesome hosts and spot. Highly recommend!
2858,42,"My husband & I had a great time here! Very relaxing atmosphere, really comfortable stay. We enjoyed the kayaks and spending time hanging out on the porch. Highly recommend!"
2859,42,"The Cedar Grove stay was exactly what I needed it to be. Clean, and cozy and just a really nice stay. Would definitely recommend"
2860,42,"Must Stay!! Perfect for a relaxing and rejuvenating stay. Beautifully done with lots of thoughtful details in a peaceful and perfect setting. Had a great time whether kayaking in lake, picnicking on the lawn, relaxing on the deck or in the house. Great small town 15 minutes away."
2861,42,"What a gem! We enjoyed our time here and would definitely come back again. The place was so clean, comfortable, and relaxing. It was such a peaceful area that was family friendly and about a 15 minute drive to downtown Hillsborough. Highly recommend!"
2862,42,"The pictures don’t do it justice! Detail oriented, beautifully decorated with thoughtful touches. Fully stocked kitchen, bathroom and linens. Having coffee on the deck in the morning was so relaxing, would go back in a second! We didn’t want to leave 😌"
2863,42,"What a beautiful mini getaway for our family! We stayed with our infant and two pups (we brought our own Pack N Play). Everything was clean, comfortable, aesthetically pleasing, and convenient. We loved the view looking out onto the water. The washing machine and dryer came in handy when our baby ruined her clothes…and ours… We ordered pickup from a delicious Italian place in nearby Hillsborough (Antonia’s) - it was convenient and delicious! We were also able to take our dogs on a nice trail nearby. Overall, it was a great stay and excellent value!"
2864,42,This place is a gem with an amazing view. We caught a lot of fish on the lake. The hosts were very helpful and accommodating with everything we needed.
2865,42,"We had a wonderful stay at Cameron and Courtney's retreat on Lake Orange. The apartment is meticulously clean and has everything you need for a comfortable stay. The property is private, serene and beautiful. The lake is fun to explore and great especially if you have kids! Cameron and Courtney are responsive and flexible and could not have been more accommodating to our evolving plans. Our only disappointment was that we could not stay longer. We will definitely be back!"
2866,42,We stayed there two days very nice place caught a lot of fish
2867,42,Super clean. Great views. Very quiet setting. A great getaway!
2868,42,Great quiet and peaceful getaway. The house was so cute! Kids had a great time fishing while we sat by the water. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great relaxing getaway.
2869,42,"I was looking for a sanctuary for a few days and this was ABSOLUTELY PERFECT! The location is beautiful and the apartment itself was ideal. It's right on the lake with nice big windows, just as the pics on this site show. It has everything you'd need with, so many beautiful touches and thoughtful amenities. I can't wait to return. I actually want to live there...lol. Thanks to my wonderful hosts!"
2870,42,Great little get-away spot!
2871,42,"We stayed 3 nights. Wished it could have been 3 weeks. If you are looking for a great place to stay away from the maddening crowds of the city, this is it. Read, relax, regenerate and just enjoy!!"
2872,42,"Very clean and comfortable spot near Hillsborough, NC! We only stayed one night as we were passing through the area so we didn't use many of the amenities that these hosts have made available. It looked like it had everything we would've needed if we stayed longer, prepared meals, wanted to kayak, etc. GPS found the location without issue and everything was as described in the listing and in reviews. Great deck, comfortable furnishings, well-appointed kitchen area - we would definitely stay here again if we return to the area. Thank you for an easy, comfortable stay!"
2873,42,"Great place to stay, extremely clean and cozy. I would definitely stay here again."
2874,42,"Great view, nice design and decor. Comfortable bed. Easy check in."
2875,42,this is a wonderful getaway! beautifully decorated and so close to the lake!
2876,42,Great apartment. Very nice farm house style accommodations. The water level in the lake was low so we didn’t use the kayaks. We did catch bass off the dock. We were in the area to visit family so we didn’t get to spend a lot of time at the property but would have like to.
2877,42,We love staying at this little piece of heaven. Nothing like waking up looking over the lake seeing the wildlife.
2878,42,This place is really nice. Very attractively done and also very comfortable. The location is wonderful by the lake with lots of green open space.
2879,42,This cabin is so cute. The kitchen is adorable. The bed is super comfortable. And the view of the water and trees is so serene. Great weekend get away.
2880,42,Great
2881,42,"What a TREAT! Dinner on that deck with the view! Our family was thrilled to spend time in this gem and our hosts were so thoughtful and gracious. The space is bright, open and flexible, easily converting into cozy sleeping arrangements for young kids on the massive and comfy sofa."
2882,42,"A great local get away!! Coming from a more urban area, being able to make short drive and feel wonderfully disconnected made this a perfect getaway! Cameron was a very communicative host and we would certainly book again!!"
2883,42,"An amazing place to stay. Clean, neat, and stylish. We all had a relaxing getaway. Highly recommended."
2884,42,"Perfect little retreat, took our toddler and had a great weekend escape."
2885,42,"Awesome place! The deck has an amazing view. Inside was very clean, bed was super comfy, kitchen had lots of small things that you may need but you tend to forget- like sugar, splenda, black pepper etc. There are lots of open space outside where children and pets can enjoy playing and running around. Hosts were very responsive, when reached out for something in the evening, got an immediate response. We would surely consider going back to this amazing place."
2886,42,This was by far the best Airbnb experience I’ve ever had. Wow!
2887,42,Very nice and perfect for our dogs...
2888,42,Nice peaceful property. Cameron had fresh beautiful flowers in the kitchen. Recommend
2889,42,This place is such a hidden gem! Incredibly gorgeous scenery and interior design. Loved the close proximity to downtown Hillsborough! Would definitely recommend!
2890,44,Wonderful location and such a beautiful condo! Everything you think you could need was provided by Kelly and Blake. Would book again when visiting Topsail
2891,44,Nice place!
2892,44,Beautiful place! Great views! Would book again!
2893,44,Kelly and Blake’s condo was the perfect weekend getaway destination! Being able to open the balcony doors to watch the sunrise and hear the ocean waves was amazing. They provided a super informative guest book that gave us all of the recommendations we needed to have an enjoyable trip. They were also very responsive and helpful with everything. I would definitely book with them again!
2894,44,The sunrises here are absolutely stunning. The location was amazing and the place felt like home. Definitely will keep in mind for future visits. Kelly and Blake were super responsive to messages and kind.
2895,44,"Beautiful place to stay. I booked this for a mini vacay for relaxation. Great location, right on the beach. Very quiet and safe community. Spacious on the inside. Kelly and Blake were super accommodating, very quick to respond. Over all highly recommend!"
2896,44,"Beautiful place right on the beach! Everything was nice and clean, will definitely be coming back!"
2897,44,Kelly and Blake were great! They were very timely in their responses! The place was incredible and exactly as the pictures portrayed. I would definitely recommend staying here:)
2898,44,"We had an incredible experience staying at this cozy condo. Very easy to get to and the unit is located on the main floor of the building. When you walk in, you are immediately greeted by the sunlight and ocean views through the sliding glass door on the back of the condo. The soft sound of the ocean waves crashing on the shoreline. The furniture and bedding are nothing short of comfy. All the standard kitchen utensils were included making me feel even more at home. Solid and easy access to the internet & wi-fi. You can tell this unit was well thought out from the written instructions to the USB outlets installed in the bedrooms for easy electrical charging. An ideal location, this ocean front condo is close enough to food, fun, and entertainment but just far enough away from the main bridge into surf city to keep you out of traffic and chaos when you want just want to rest up or take a nap. Even closer to Sneads Ferry giving you access to more food and fun off island. We come again!"
2899,45,Loved it!
2900,45,Fantastic place off the beaten path. Very private and peaceful. Faces southeast and has a great view for sunrise. Would absolutely recommend!
2901,45,Great cabin with awesome views!
2902,45,Very clean and amazing.
2903,45,"This was our second stay here and it was just as amazing as the first visit. This time we had our four month old daughter with us. For anyone wishing to travel here with a child there is ample room for a pack and play to keep them in and there is a spot to plug in a sound machine if needed for white noise. If you travel during the spring or summer it will be bright in the cabin until the sun sets. We brought a sheet to drape over top of the pack and play which helped block some of the light so our baby could sleep. Definitely a great place to get out with a baby! Also, the property is amazing and we loved walking it with our dog. It is very private. Highly recommend staying here! This place is a gem."
2904,45,Highly recommend! Even more amazing than photos show. We will absolutely be back when it’s warm enough to sleep with the door open. What a treat to wake up to such a gorgeous view in such a private place. The propane heater kept us warm during a cold night and the toilet (basically a private Porto potty) was very clean and not yucky at all. Easy 25 min drive to downtown Asheville. The most luxury glamping experience you’ll ever have. Can’t wait to stay at all of Haley’s other places!!! We want to try the one with the bathtub next to the creek next.
2905,45,Perfection. Heaven in every way.
2906,45,"Wow! This place was amazing!!! If you are looking for a private mountain getaway, this is the spot. We had such a great time and loved the view. Haley was so informative and flexible with us. She responded quickly and was so friendly! We cannot wait to stay again ☺️"
2907,45,Amazing stay in the mountains. Ready to come back!
2908,45,"An amazing escape. A perfect place for a “boys” trip for my dog and I. We loved the privacy and the coziness of the space. It felt super safe and was a phenomenal experience. Consider the weather when booking: the wind on the ridge line isn’t for the faint of heart, but it is definitely worth it (and the cabin feels quite sturdy even in high winds)."
2909,45,"Just perfect! The views are amazing, very clean and so quiet!"
2910,45,The view was beautiful and the cabin was very homey. It was a very nice place to stay and had a great location between a couple towns and the blue ridge parkway. I would highly recommend staying here!
2911,45,Absolutely stunning views and a comfy space that had all essentials you could need
2912,45,Definitely add this place to your list! Had a relaxing weekend here and even though it was cold out we stayed nice and warm inside. Lovely views too.
2913,45,"This place was off the beaten path and perfect for a quiet, peaceful, getaway. The views were breathtaking—especially the stars on clear nights. The property was great to explore and there was good hiking nearby. We enjoyed Doc Brown’s BBQ in town, but mostly cooked right in the cabin. Would highly recommend and hope to be back soon."
2914,45,Such a cool spot! I will definitely be back!
2915,45,Amazing place to unplug and relax with an incredible view. The propane heater kept the cabin plenty warm even on a very cold rainy day.
2916,45,"Let me start by saying, the swing alone made this spot worth it! Absolutely beautiful view. We had a photographer come out and take our pictures and I can’t wait to see them all. The view from the balcony is amazing to wake up to every morning. The floors do get pretty cold during colder days/nights so if you’re typically a person that gets cold, sleep on the side with the heater! This was definitely a good experience!"
2917,45,"This place is so magical! For a small space, it is extremely well designed and the attention to detail is above + beyond. We stayed with our two pups and really didn’t want to leave. The indoor/outdoor vibe is such a dream and that view never gets old! Cannot recommend enough."
2918,45,"Breathtaking views, peaceful, great stay. The shower isn’t super warm 😉"
2919,45,This place was phenomenal. If you want private serenity— this is the place. The drive up can be daunting but it’s so worth it! The seclusion made this home even more special. We will definitely return! The host was amazing and quick to respond as well!
2920,45,it was just me and my dog and everything was great. very peaceful. great views. the shower was a bit lackluster but it was better than nothing. overall a great experience very healing.
2921,45,This gem of a place is amazing! We love pup friendly places that are super remote. The views were amazing and Haley’s descriptions of her property were right on! Only a short 15 min drive to Downtown Asheville. We will def be back!
2922,45,"The cabin was just magical. You will experience coziness like never before. Nothing beats opening your eyes to see the sunrise over the mountains. We had everything we needed and enjoyed every single thing about the cabin, including the propane heater that added that extra coziness. Not to mention the cabin is only 30 minutes from downtown Asheville so we were able to enjoy activities around town, go for a hike, and still make it to the cabin just before dark. Wish we could have stayed longer!"
2923,45,Fantastic spot and amazing views
2924,45,Breath taking location! I didn’t want to leave!
2925,45,"Haley and Christi were awesome hosts! Very responsive, and they have great recommendations on what to do locally in Asheville. The view out here is to die for, and it’s such a nice escape from busy city life."
2926,45,It was a great time and incredibly beautiful
2927,45,The perfect spot for a little getaway! It is absolutely stunning and the pictures don’t do it justice!
2928,45,We enjoyed the cabin the hosts were great to work with. Everything was as described clean. Absolutely beautiful view.
2929,45,"There’s only one word to describe this cabin.
Perfect.
Small, quaint and tastefully appointed, it’s a must for anyone looking to unplug from the word and relax. The views alone are worth it, but the little touches like the outdoor shower, rope swing, and fire pit, really all add to the peaceful zen-like experience.
I honestly can’t wait to go back.

If you’re reading this review, debating whether to spend time here, do not hesitate. You will not be disappointed."
2930,45,"Haley's listing was secluded and very peaceful. There isn't much to do around the area, but it was the perfect place to unplug. For such a small space without electricity, the cabin had everything you needed. There is a generator, a small sink/water jugs, and a heater that is easy to operate.. as well as dishes, games, and a little French press for coffee in the mornings! We found a little swing (with incredible views) just a short walk from the cabin and enjoyed watching the sunset there. We brought our pup with us too and there were plenty of places to explore. Would recommend!"
2931,45,"The perfect off-grid location. Just want my wife and three pups needed. Close to great hikes, loved the swing and extremely private location. Would go again!"
2932,45,So peaceful! Beautiful getaway
2933,45,Beautiful Views! Very safe and amazing communication :)
2934,45,"The host(s) were absolutely wonderful. They were excellent communicators, provided a plethora of local options/suggestions, were kind and had grace. It was a nice little cabin to disconnect from the hustle and bustle of daily living."
2935,45,Great place to get away! Beautiful views!
2936,45,My husband and I had such a wonderful and positive experience at the cabin. Haley was quick to respond to any questions or concerns we had. We were lucky the weather was good and the sky was clear. We could see all the stars. It was truly magical. We will definitely visit again.
2937,45,We enjoyed the charm and beauty of both the Creekside cabin and the off-grid cabin on the Ridge. We will have great memories to add to our wonderful time in the mountains.
2938,45,Really cool little place. Peaceful. Appreciated the detailed instructions provided for every little piece of the experience. Thank you to great hosts!
2939,45,"We absolutely love the place, the view was amazing. So peaceful and beautiful!"
2940,45,"Amazing place for privacy! The shower was ""refreshing"" standing out in the cold weather! :). Everything was great! Well worth it for some peace. Exactly what I needed. Communication was perfect! Go for it!"
2941,45,"When your looking for an amazing place to escape reality the Ridge is the place to go! This location is surrounded by mountains giving you breathtaking views from every direction. Once settled in you’ll never want to leave, it’s a wonderful place to be able to call home for a temporary time."
2942,45,"This place is amazing and totally worth checking out! There’s everything you need for a full glamping experience, and the views are fantastic! We can’t wait to come back :)"
2943,45,A perfect hideaway from life amongst the mountain tops..peace and quiet found the moment you reach the top…Amazing picturesque views .. the sound of rain gently tapping the rooftop..the wind whipping through the tall trees..warm sunlight kissing your cheeks in the early am..beautiful and quaint place among the mountain tops to keep those forever memories~
2944,45,"This was one of the best Airbnbs we've been too! There was beautiful scenery, was private, and very clean. We woke up to a gorgeous sunrise which we could view through the glass garage door. The directions were easy to follow, Haley was a great communicator, and we stayed nice and warm all night with the propane heater. We made tea in the morning and sat out on the deck listening to the birds which was very relaxing. My favorite thing at this place though was the 2 person swing- so much fun!! I would recommend this Airbnb to anyone who loves the outdoors and wants an adventurous getaway. If we're ever in the area again, we would definitely visit again!"
2945,45,Can’t say enough good things - this is truly a one of a kind experience that you hope for in a rental (vs a hotel or more conventional option). Definitely a rustic experience but wouldn’t trade the views and unique experience for anything! If you want to get away from everything for a minute this is definitely the place.
2946,45,"Glamping with an incredible view - temps were below freezing outside, but comfortable enough inside (with a few proper sleeping bags and the gas wall heater). I enjoyed using the mini- kitchen setup for both dinner and breakfast. My son and I slept well and had a few nice meals + a great hike the 2nd day. Memories created that will last a life time…."
2947,45,"This cabin succeeded my expectations, the view to the mountains was amazing (better than the pictures) and you can see all the stars at night!! Temperature outside was very cold but the cabin stayed at a good temperature, however I will definitely recommend a heated blanket if you go during winter! The host was great, she was always available for any questions we had, we are definitely coming back next year!!🥰"
2948,45,Amazing getaway spot and very pet friendly! We can’t wait to return again soon!
2949,45,"I’m incredibly grateful to Haley to be able to have stayed in her cabin. It was incredibly peaceful and so beautiful with great views. I loved how it was remote enough where we weren’t bothered by anyone, yet still close enough to get help quickly if we needed it.
I also thought we’d need more than what we did, but when we arrived I was pleasantly surprised and impressed that everything I needed was already there, plus things that I hadn’t thought of, such as an air horn in case there was an emergency. There were also supplies readily available that was suggested we bring ourselves just in case we forgot, such as games, a lateen, and bedding, which was an incredibly nice and thoughtful touch.
The propane heater did throw us for a loop and scared us slightly the first night because the way it ticks sounds like someone’s tapping outside, but everything else was truly perfect and I can’t wait to one day come back!"
2950,45,Great spot for a private/off the grid getaway…Just as pictured and described. Would love to come back during the spring or fall to experience the space with tree foliage. Would definitely recommend.
2951,45,Loved it!
2952,45,"Haley's place was absolutely amazing. It was a very peaceful, isolated location. So don't be afraid when you see the open tub and toilet. There's nobody even remotely close and you get the feel of taking a shower in nature. But bring a flashlight or lantern for those night-time toilet visits. The shower bag takes a little getting used to. I had zero sun while there, so I had to heat up water on the stove for warm water. It's easier using the water kettle from the stove to pour into the bag. The only drawback to my stay. was that I had absolutely horrendous weather, which meant I had to stay inside most of the visit. While they have a few games there to play, I would advise that you bring your own for entertainment in case you're stuck inside for a while, especially if alone. But this is in no way a reflection of the cabin. There are places nearby that you can explore. But because of weather, I was only able to visit one, skinny-dip falls. I highly recommend for nature lovers."
2953,45,"Beautiful cabin with gorgeous views. Thank you for sharing your incredible property. We would love to return during a warmer, dryer time so we could leave the garage door open."
2954,45,"Amazing view and set up— loved our time here! Two things to note— the shower is a self-fill camp shower bag and not the shower head shown in the pictures. This is mentioned in the description but the pictures might throw you off. The bed is also very firm. I found it very uncomfortable and left with back pain that I did not arrive with. Outside of that, the cabin was incredibly well provisioned, the heat worked well, and Haley was great to communicate with!"
2955,45,Great views and perfectly sized!
2956,45,The perfect weekend getaway! My husband and I enjoyed staying in this adorable cabin. It was so nice to disconnect and breathe in the fresh mountain air! The view was incredible! We enjoyed the hiking trails close by. We loved that this cabin was pet friendly as well! We highly recommend this cabin!
2957,45,"Absolutely stunning views. I came alone to process some thoughts, it was the great place to do deep thinking. The swing was fun, it let my inner child play. There was an area to do a campfire, a nice hammock and a beautiful balcony with priceless views."
2958,45,Such an amazing place with an amazing view. Simple and rustic just the way we hoped. Even if we were doing nothing else on our trip this would have been enough.
2959,45,"Our stay at Haley’s Airbnb was one of the most special airbnbs we ever stayed at. Such a great place, beautifully built and we felt very special to have stayed at such an Airbnb. Haley was very responsive and took great care of everything for us. We would definetely stay again and recommend anyone to stay at Haley’s place!"
2960,45,Amazing cabin. The views are amazing all around the cabin. Perfect getaway where you can enjoy views from the cabin along with a nice fire. Sunrise and sunsets are both amazing from the cabin. Highly recommend the stay here.
2961,45,"Beautiful spot on top of the mountain, great views and you can see Mount Pisgah well. So cute overall. ❤️"
2962,45,This place is absolutely amazing! I am a local to the area and grew up just 45 minutes from here and I was still in awe of how beautiful of an experience this was. The cabin was so cute and Haley thought of everything. We cannot wait to book again and go back!
2963,45,Stayed here and at the hammock house for my wife and I's homeymoon. Was an amazing time and would definitely recommend! We will be returning!
2964,45,great view!!!
2965,45,Haley’s place was stunning! It’s hard to decide if it was more beautiful at sunset or sunrise. Was worth it to go in the fall and see the pretty colors!
2966,45,A majority of the views on the blue ridge parkway don’t even compare to how amazing the views are at this cabin. We loved how secluded it was.. the little stove was perfect for the nights we didn’t feel like driving into town to go out to dinner. The cabin was clean. The hosts answered my messages right away when I had a question. We can’t wait to stay here again
2967,45,Great place!
2968,45,"A beautiful stay, highly recommend staying here if you want to connect with nature and want a recharge. This place is breath taking! 20/10."
2969,45,"Great cabin with the best views!! Loved every minute of our stay. We enjoyed the swing and sitting on the porch. I will be booking again for next years fall trip!

Haley was very easy to get in touch with if need be and everything listed on the listing was accurate and written down to a tee.

Perfection!!"
2970,45,"I cannot say enough about this place. Beautiful, peaceful, just complete bliss if you need to get away from the daily grind. My only suggestion is to book for at least two nights if possible, you will not want to leave so soon! Haley was amazing with communication, especially since it's a bit spotty there - which is desirable! We cannot wait to stay again"
2971,45,Perfect cabin in the mountains. Driving up the road wasn't as bad I I was expecting with a Toyota camery. Check in was super easy and we had everything we needed. The propane water heater wasn't available so we just used the camping water bag. Unfortunatelythe weather was really stormy and rained a lot in the night meaning there was no warm water the next day. Despite the bad weather we stayed warm and dry even though we were a little unsure at times :)
2972,45,"We are so grateful that this place exists! Checking in was easy. Haley and Christy were awesome. The design of the cabin itself was very well thought out. Rustic, simple, but with modern touches to make the stay feel more accommodating. The views are incredible. Waking up to the sunlight touching the peaks of the adjacent mountain was the best way to start the day. The drive to the cabin is steep, as long as we maintained our momentum we made it up just fine without AWD. (For perspective, we drove a Mazda CX-5 with 2 people, 2 dogs, and loaded with cargo). Swing is a fun bonus. We can’t wait to return!"
2973,45,"Another amazing stay at the off grid cabin hosted by Haley. The drive up is a little tedious, but the view alone is perfect and worth it. We had a little snag with the propane, but Haley was very quick to respond and help. We would definitely recommend her off grid cabin to anyone, and we will gladly be back!"
2974,45,"You want to stay here. That’s all there is to it! For a rustic cabin and camping feel, it’s super clean and has some great amenities with the solar lights, burner stove, and heater. It’s so secluded and private which makes it feel so romantic!! If you go in the fall you’re in for a treat... the view was INCREDIBLE with the leaves changing! Although I’m sure other seasons are just as beautiful! We loved the swing and making a fire in the fire pit as well. Thanks for a great stay Haley and Christy! Will definitely be recommending to friends and family who need a getaway like we did!"
2975,45,"This is truly a one of a kind experience in the fall. My wife and I considered ourselves so lucky to stay here, it was well worth the experience!"
2976,45,"Relaxing weekend away with amazing views! This is our second time staying at one of Haley’s sites. We appreciate her detailed instructions and recommendations. Be sure to screenshot these in case service is spotty at the cabin. We enjoyed hiking off the Blue Ridge Parkway during our stay- which is a beautiful drive and fairly close. We also got plenty of rest at the cabin, while enjoying the peace that nature has to offer. The swing was a great touch, made us feel like kids again. Over all, it was another amazing stay. We are already missing the views and planning our next trip to go back!"
2977,45,"This was a fantastic getaway! Views were amazing, cabin was amazing, and it was the best relaxation we’ve had in a while!"
2978,45,I really enjoyed our stay! Would highly recommend!
2979,45,It was simply magical ✨
2980,45,"beautiful views, relaxing trip! would recommend for anyone wanting a tech free weekend"
2981,45,The place was incredible! It had everything we needed and was so clean. I will definitely be coming back and staying again. 10/10 must stay location. The views were breathtaking. Best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in.
2982,45,Great experience! Would recommend to someone who definitely is a thrill seeker and an outdoorsman!
2983,45,"We loved our stay at the off-grid cabin on the ridge. This was our second time staying at one of Haley’s properties, and like our last stay, everything was what we expected and even more. The cabin is adorable, cozy, and provides the perfect opportunity to unplug and enjoy the quiet nature. Cannot beat that view! Love the easy access to both the parkway and downtown Asheville. Would highly recommend and cannot wait to come back again."
2984,45,"Amazing, so relaxing and loved the view"
2985,45,"Our stay here was amazing and we already talk about coming back. Everything was clean and easy to use, and stocked with the basic necessities needed. Haley’s instructions were very easy to navigate and we found it with no issues. The views were incredible to wake up and watch the sun rise, and it was so nice to unplug and just relax."
2986,45,"I wish I could give this place more than 5 stars. Pictures will never do it justice. By far the best Airbnb we have ever stayed at. We just got back home, and we are already planning another trip back. The best part is how remote you are and the privacy. There is no other cabins anywhere close, which is what you want for this type of mountain getaway. We are already looking forward to coming back next year!!"
2987,45,"This place is everything that is advertised! Great area, amazing views, very cool off the grid experience where you can just enjoy your time without worrying about a thing. 10/10 will be recommending this stay to friends headed to Asheville!"
2988,45,Perfect getaway!
2989,45,"This place is so cute! Has everything you need plus some. The swing is very relaxing! The views were great! The Bed was Comfortable (which is rare but was very nice). Communication was great, directions to the cabin and how to use items located in the cabin made everything go very smoothly. Off the grid but definitely clamping! And Actually still had random cell phone service. Will stay again."
2990,45,"Such a wonderful experience, first off the view was incredible. Great Romantic get away and perfect for a photoshoot. Pretty close to downtown Ashville which was perfect for checking out breweries and art galleries. Haley and her staff were wonderful and quick with responses. 100% recommended checking out this space or another one that she has. We definitely plan to come back sometime soon !"
2991,45,"A truly spectacular experience & awesome views! The perfect place to disconnect from the world (as it’s truly off grid and cell phone service was spotty). Absolutely loved the view of the night sky and stars through the glass garage door!! Truly appreciated Haley & Christy’s detailed directions, instructions and videos for the cabin. Super responsive hosts too! 10/10 Stars…would definitely recommend!"
2992,45,Our favorite Asheville getaway spot. 3rd time staying here.
2993,45,"Beautiful place, just as described (if you’re trying to glamp this is not the place for you- it’s truly off grid so make sure to read the amenity list!) We personally loved getting to unplug & enjoy nature. There are so many gorgeous views!"
2994,45,"Haley communicated so well with us, and our stay was everything we expected! Awesome experience overall, we LOVED the swing, too. Super unique.😊"
2995,45,"We had a great stay at this place - nothing can beat that view!
Be sure your car has enough power for the hill… our hybrid didn’t quite make it to the top :)"
2996,45,"This cabin is a must book! It was the perfect get away for my husband and I, and we were able to bring our dog with us! The location is very secluded and the view is absolutely amazing! The cabin was so cozy and we loved being able to keep the garage door open for a breeze. It was the most peaceful mini vacation we've been on! My husband and I loved everything about our stay at this cabin and would definitely book it again!!"
2997,46,"The home was beautifully decorated. My kids loved the swings and we enjoyed sitting the deck and listening to the waves crashing. The beds were super comfortable and overall it was a nice stay and experience, location to beach access worked out great"
2998,46,Wonderful and comfortable location right across the street from the beach! Would definitely stay here again!
2999,46,The house is as advertised. Looks like the pictures. Host is very nice and tries to help with questions.
3000,46,"We loved this home! It was so beautifully decorated, clean, had everything we needed, convenient location, short walk to the beach. We definitely will be back to stay here again in the future!"
3001,46,Thanks Katrina!
3002,46,BEAUTIFUL place! Amazingly decorated and very quiet area… I will be booking this again
3003,46,Thank YOU Tom. Come back and stay any time!
3004,46,We had a great stay it was a very relaxing getaway.
3005,46,Thank you very much for staying!
3006,46,"Lindsay’s place was wonderful, easily the best decorated place I have stayed. Clean, amazing location and we could hear the ocean! Great amenities and the perfect size. Would happily stay again"
3007,46,So sweet! Thanks Audrey. Come back soon!
3008,46,"It was a super cute place and everything was as advertised.
There was one issue with the cleaning crew not showing up before we arrived, but the owner was on it, immediately responsive and handled the problem literally overnight. Mistakes happen. Fixing them is what matters and they did just that … all I could ask for."
3009,46,We loved our stay. Beautiful and bright decor with thoughtful touches throughout. My kids loved the swings and bunk beds. The mattresses are excellent and the place was incredibly clean. The beach access is super close - less than a minute away on a paved path. Lindsay was wonderful and made sure we had an excellent stay. We will definitely return!
3010,46,"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful place. Amazing for pictures. Comfy, peaceful! It was everything. Can’t wait to get back ❤️"
3011,46,"MUST STAY AT THIS PLACE! You will feel right at home - it is modern yet cozy, you can even see the ocean from the living room! Kitchen was amazing and very spacious - great for cooking if you do want to make some meals/treats yourself while you are away. Bed was really comfortable as well and the room could get very dark which definitely aids in getting a good nights sleep. The beach is literally 30 seconds away and breathtaking - we even saw a dolphin pod of over 50 and the most magical sunset! Lindsay was really helpful and friendly when i messaged her as well. 1000/10 recommend this place - it is so worth the money! Ps if you are a content creator or want to make photos : the airbnb and surf city lends itself perfectly for that!"
3012,46,"Such a fun beach getaway! The swings in the kitchen are the perfect touch, everything was decorated really cute. Very short walk to the beach entrance!"
3013,47,Amazing! Beautiful space and amazing communication from Carleigh. We had an amazing time and will definitely be going back to Happy the Bus in the future! Super clean and a welcoming space. 10/10!!!
3014,47,"Magical little spot! Even better than the photos and so many thoughtful touches. Nice snacks, natural soap products, cozy bed and there was even a diffuser on when we arrived with nice essential oils <3 The hosts are lovely and we wish we had more days to stay here. Highly recommend!"
3015,47,"We absolutely adored staying here. It was clean and cozy and waking up to the sound of rain was wonderful. I wish we could have stayed longer then one night, but it was magical to say the least."
3016,47,"Happy is the perfect little getaway. It is a wonderful experience being hosted by Carleigh. We wouldn't change a change. When you leave, you'll feel rejuvenated and ready to conquer the world. There are so many amenities on the property, you will be comfortable and then some. Highly recommended!"
3017,47,"""Happy"" was a really fun getaway and had the perfect touches to make it an experience. We appreciated all the details inside and outside of the bus. Comfortable, clean and well decorated."
3018,47,Such a wonderful stay. I enjoyed Happy so much and would love to come back one day soon!
3019,47,"Traveling to Duke for doctor appointments we wanted a bit of fun in the stay. The bus, a sight to behold in the woods, did not disappoint, though the hammock got me first. Details of furnishings—from library to lighting, floor to ceiling, sofa to bed—were comfortable and well done. And then ice cream snacks in the freezer! Carleigh welcomed us well. Just what this doctor-weary person needed."
3020,47,Great vibe. Very relaxing.
3021,47,"11/10 would recommend. Happy is the best place to take a break from reality. The hospitality from the owners was amazing. Happy the Bus is stocked with games, snacks, a beautiful atmosphere, and the comfiest shed ever if I might add. The price is unbeatable and I highly recommend. It was the best stay ever! :)"
3022,47,This was a very beautiful stay. The pictures do not do it justice. The hosts were very kind as well. Everything was perfect.
3023,47,"This place is magical!! Such a great value and a perfect getaway! Felt like we were hidden away in nature but still close to so much to do! Carleigh was an absolute wonderful host and I can't wait to go back and visit again! Highly recommend staying in this cozy, adorable bus! Happy will you happy for sure!"
3024,47,Wonderful experience. Perfect little getaway for couples and great communication from the owners. Left some gifts for us when we arrived and gave great suggestions for things to do and places to eat around town.
3025,47,"We were very overwhelmed and would love to come back more often if we lived nearby. It really is a special and extraordinary experience! With so much attention to detail, the bus was expanded and the entire property was laid out. I am at a loss for words!"
3026,47,"Details are the reason we love the places we go, but no place has given me such an appreciation for the small details like this place. “Happy”-so perfectly named… describes the feeling that my son and I so joyfully captured. It’s not just the adorable name of this bus -turned -tiny home….experience, it describes the emotions surging through your spirit as you take in the sweet meaningful details.
-A beautiful healthy fern hanging at the door.
-A well loved guitar hanging in the window.
-a diffuser with lavender— filling the atmosphere.
-a selection of juicy reads above the driver’s seat.
-draped lighting that set such a mood.
- frosty cool AC on a hot day.
-coffee mugs hanging above the sink.
-A French press for the sassy girl in me that wants to be boujiee!
-a medicine cabinet filled with all the little things you’ve probably packed because you didn’t think they’d provide it!
-a bed so soft you’ll need some nuzzling time within those white sheets!
-fresh brown eggs strait from The chicken’s booty ( as Sweet Carleigh put it so eloquently)
-frozen sweet snacks that delighted my 14 year old in between his lazy swings on the hammock.
Frying pans that make any meal taste good because of the quality.
I could go on, but you should experience the same element of surprise that we did. You’re gonna love it! You’re gonna wanna book it again. You’re gonna wish you had the perfect company so make sure you bring that person who’ll bask in the nature right along with you. Although I brought a kid- this is the best get away for two besties, two lovers… especially two lovers… and an even better place for you. Just you alone. Carleigh- thank you for having a vision for a true place of safety, respite, peace and tranquility. Thank you for keeping a price that allows families to afford something so magical if they would only step into nature’s heartbeat!
-"
3027,47,Highly recommend! Such an amazing and quiet get away for me and the wife and so much is included that’s not even listed in description
3028,47,"Such a great experience with Happy. It was our last night of our cross country road trip and Happy was such a memorable space. Carleigh's energy is amazing, and everything was laid out for me and my partner. The ambiance is calming and gives you a feel of camping without tents. Love love love."
3029,47,"Ahh yall were wonderful humans! Stoked for all the adventures ahead for you two.. I've got a hunch yall will get into some fun!

Haha oh my gosh the sad thing is we do have a shower matt.. it's just tucked right under the bed for you .. haha I just forgot to show you.. classic. BUT.. that is great protip...hehe gonna work on making a little welcome binder so folks no random little tidbits... aint nobody want wet feet on the floor!

Yall are truly lovely. Happy trails my friends.. and if you're ever this way don't be a stranger! :)

Love+Light"
3030,47,"Beautiful, magical space. Carleigh is so kind, loving, and considerate. A must stay! You will be surrounded by so much beauty & joy. ❤️ The bus is beautiful and they have so many little treats in the fridge and pantries. The kitchen is lovely to cook in. The whole experience is a 10/10."
3031,47,"Carleigh and Tina are super nice, warm and welcoming people. If you‘re new to the area and not sure what to do, they‘ve got more than enough recommendations for you! And will also be very responsive should you need anything.
The bus Happy is amazing! You‘ll basically have a whole appartment to yourself, with all the comfort an appartment should come with. Only that its in the woods in a bus with a terrace on the roof. Would have loved to stay longer, would most definitely revisit!"
3032,47,"Exceptional attention to detail. Clean, comfortable, relaxing, so much value to be had here. Wonderful and well worth it. This is a must see if you are an Airbnb regular- must see! And if new, please come be spoiled here!"
3033,47,"Staying at Happy the Bus was truly an amazing experience! The hospitality that Catina offer their guests is unmatched. From a stocked pantry, to a cozy bed, to bringing us games and more. It’s hard to believe that we were only your second guests. We will definitely be back again."
3034,47,"Everything was ACTUALLY perfect. We stopped thinking it would be nice but it exceeded our expectations for sure. The couple hosting was super chill and nice and gave a great list of places to try in the area. I can't keep going because I don't have anything bad to say about my experience there. The next day I was yelling ""I STAYED ON THE CUTEST BUS OF MY LIFE LAST NIGHT AND I NEED TO GO BACK"" to anyone who would listen to me. Also, Smokey Joe is SUCH a nice hang out spot."
3035,48,Another good stay!
3036,48,Great stay yet again! Can’t wait to return.
3037,48,We had a fabulous stay at Mikes charming cottage by the sea.
3038,48,Mikes place is an absolute gem! While it seems small from the outside he’s perfected the layout and it’s very spacious! We cooked a few meals the kitchen is very great and usable. Literally steps from the beach and while we didn’t use the firepower it is very well maintained! Definitely would rent again
3039,48,"My stay was exactly what I needed. Peaceful, right in the water and the fenced yard for my dogs was perfect so they could go on vacation with me. I’ll definitely be back! Thanks so much"
3040,48,Sandpiper was the perfect peaceful getaway for a night! Right on the beach and had the best beach cottage vibe. Beach chairs and towels provided made it easy to just show up and enjoy. The front porch with the rockers were my favorite! We loved it.
3041,48,"Adorable place and amazing location! We loved our stay and look forward to coming back. It is a perfect peaceful getaway with every amenity you could need.
A word of warning, the bed is very high off the floor. The host has provided a step stool, so you can get in and out of bed even if you are a shorty like me. If you have poor balance or are up a lot in the night this might not be your best match."
3042,48,"great little place. right on the beach, club de to restaurants. recommended."
3043,48,Great place! enjoyed staying right on the beach with my dogs. Very cozy and relaxing. The only negative is that the gate needs some WD 40 on the latch and if you have a small dog they will find the gate easy to slip under. Mine did! All in all great get away!
3044,48,This is a great little place to stay. Very understated outside and carefully updated inside. An amazing kitchen. Spotlessly clean and right on the ocean. We loved it!
3045,48,"Adorable place!
Very clean and peaceful
Would definitely plan several more stays!"
3046,48,"Wonderful stay, cozy cottage, beautiful location!"
3047,48,"Always so peaceful to stay here.
This time I invited friends and made a long weekend that was just perfect. From the cozy porch and yard, well stocked kitchen to make homemade meals, fenced yard for the pups and being just steps from the beach it is just a special place. Already looking forward to next time! Thanks, Mike!"
3048,48,"nice little beachfront cottage. enjoyed sitting on the porch looking out over the ocean. easy beach access and plenty of wide open beach. we had a great visit, thx"
3049,48,"Was really pleased with the property. Went for a weekend getaway to celebrate a relatives birthday and loved it! Very clean, easy to access, and plenty of privacy."
3050,48,"Our stay at the Sandpiper cottage was a gift from our children. It was a wonderful 3 nights. The cottage is bright, cute and just the right size for two people. We loved the back porch that looked over the wild oats to the ocean. The kitchen was well supplied. Though we didn’t bring our dog, the fenced backyard would have been a great place for him to hang out. The owners were very responsive when we had questions before our arrival. I would give this cottage 5 stars and hope to stay there again."
3051,48,"Sandpiper is a great, affordable stay at the beach. The duplex is perfect for our needs - huge bonus that it's pet friendly! Very enjoyable stay."
3052,48,"This is a very special place. The view is amazing. You can grab a cup of coffee and a book, relax in a rocking chair and watch the sunrise over the water from the porch. The space was smaller than what we are used to, but they made such great use of every inch of it! We truly enjoyed our stay here. We had everything we needed kitchen and entertainment wise. We loved the fenced in yard for the pup and the fire pit in the front. The heated bathroom floors were a nice touch and we appreciated all of the little details they added here and there that made the cottage so cozy and welcoming."
3053,48,"Perfect place, perfect location, perfect view!! It had everything I needed and then some!"
3054,48,Great stay. Would absolutely visit again.
3055,48,"We had the most amazing time at The Sandpiper. Perfect location, super clean and all the amenities you could possibly need. The fenced in yard was a huge bonus for my four legged friends. There is no better view from which to drink coffee and enjoy the ocean. And the fire pit was awesome too!"
3056,48,"Location, location, location! Sit on the porch and watch the sunrise and the waves roll in! A few steps and your on the beach! Easy access right outside the property gate. Fence was so convenient for our pup. Fire pit ready for wood. Well stocked kitchen! Comfy bed! Mike is very responsive and noted he was readily available if we needed anything! Great second stay and we’ll be back!"
3057,48,Perfect place for 1 or 2 people and especially great for our dogs. No stairs to deal with and the little fenced in yard is awesome to have. Hope to return some day.
3058,48,"This is our second visit , now we’ve stayed on both sides. Can’t wait to return, so perfect for our dear old dog who can’t do steps….but beware of the sand spurs as your pup goes in the backyard. The porch with blankets and more coffee was heavenly! A hawk flew right in front of us this morning and landed next door.!"
3059,48,"This is one of my favorite places to visit. It is ideally located, dog friendly, and every little convenience is already there for you."
3060,48,We love Sandpiper so much! We want to move in permanently. It’s the perfect gem to come and relax and enjoy the close proximity to the beach. The kitchen has all that you need to cook all your meals. Mike is a great host and very responsive. We can’t wait to come back!!
3061,48,"Great Place, as pictured and described. Would recommend!"
3062,48,This place is wonderful and exactly as advertised. It was stocked with everything we could have possibly needed. Would highly recommend!
3063,48,"Such a cute gem of a place right on the beach. The views are incredible and being footsteps from the ocean is all that you need. I appreciated that Mike allows dogs as I needed to bring my pet along. We appreciated the fenced in yard and the front porch! Also, the kitchen has all you need to make meals or if you don’t feel like cooking, there are numerous restaurants close by. I will definitely be booking again!"
3064,48,"It was perfect for a couple's getaway. Loved how it had a little fenced in area for pets. Oceanfront view was really nice, didn't get to use the firepit because it was a little windy. Everything was clean and communication was excellent."
3065,48,PERFECT!!!
3066,49,Very quick to respond when we contacted them. Very friendly.
3067,49,"10/10 would recommend!! Book this place for beautiful views and an amazing cabin to spend a few nights in. Michael was a very hospitable host, and I cannot wait to return for another stay!"
3068,49,"Thank you so much, Elizabeth, for your kind words."
3069,49,"Super welcoming and attentive hosts, and the tiny home and location is perfect! Had a great time and would definitely recommend to others."
3070,49,"Thank you so much, Jessie, for taking the time to leave such a nice review."
3071,49,"As always, awesome host. the only kicker was I'm pretty sure the best was listed as larger than it actually was. It was an adventure for sure! the stairs are a challenge for sure, so if you're out of shape or have any aiglments, then definitely choose to stay in the other tiny house they host. The view was awesome amazing and it's such a nice little hideaway."
3072,49,"Thank you, Stephanie, for choosing to stay with us again in the high country! Little Red has a queen sized bed. It does feel smaller since it is positioned on the floor of the loft. We will check to make sure the listing is correct. Thank you so much for letting us know."
3073,49,"Michael was quick to respond, super helpful, and friendly! The tiny house was so cute and and secluded- great place to relax and have some peace and quite."
3074,49,"Fantastic house! the host, Michael, was even willing to come by and help us get the fire started! Such a Great time"
3075,49,"Michael and Samantha’s place was very peaceful and exactly what we wanted for some time to unwind. They were very responsive and the surroundings, while off the beaten path for sure, were beautiful. As long as you don’t mind a drive to town, this place is perfect. We recommend star gazing!"
3076,49,Thank you Lucy!
3077,49,"Had a great time, wonderful place. Hosts were very friendly and communicative. Very easy to check in and check out with clear instructions and expectations."
3078,49,Thank you Gage!
3079,49,Beautiful place and super unique! We loved it and it was so peaceful out there❤️ Micheal and Samantha were also super quick to respond and very clear with all of the instructions! Would definitely stay again!
3080,49,Thank you Daniela!
3081,49,"Wonderful time staying at this Airbnb! The home is very cute and comfortable. The space is great for a weekend getaway! The area is quiet and peaceful. Felt safe, cozy and at home! Would definitely come back to stay!!"
3082,49,Thank you Crystal!
3083,49,I loved Tiny Red! Beautiful view. Will come again.
3084,49,"Michael and Samantha are great people, who love what they are doing!

Place is beautiful and clean, it was perfect for our small runaway from the world!y husband and I enjoyed it so much :)


You should definitely check it out during summer or fall, the views will be breathtaking!"
3085,49,"I was looking for silence, solitude, and simplicity. All three were found at this stay. I couldn’t have been happier with my experience. I’ll be back."
3086,49,"We absolutely loved Little Red Tiny! It was perfect for a getaway weekend in the Mountains—Ohh and the view was breathtaking!
We literally felt like kids again, as we enjoyed the loft experience for sleeping and watching tv. We were so giddy each time we came back, like, “We’re home!” and so happy to get inside to cuddle up and relax. We also seen lots of farm animals and deer around. Michael and Samantha responded within the hour and when asked for recommendations, Michael and Samantha suggested a personal phone call to see what kind of food we enjoyed and types of activities we liked, so they could share the best matched restaurants and places to explore. During our stay they reached out to see how check in was and if everything was running smoothly. They shared they weren’t too far away and to not hesitate to reach out if we needed anything at all. Overall, we would absolutely recommend Michael and Samantha’s Little Red Tiny Home Airbnb to friends and family!

-Melissa"
3087,49,Micheal and Samantha was amazing host!! Loved the house and the area!
3088,49,We so enjoyed a peaceful getaway in this tiny home! Michael and Samantha were so hospitable and went the extra mile to make our stay great! The tiny home packs a lot into the tiny space and the views off of the porch are simply beautiful!
3089,49,"The stay here was incredible!
Beyond peaceful. On two different occasions I watched deer cross through the bottom infront of the house. Very serene."
3090,49,It was great!
3091,49,Our stay here was fantastic!
3092,49,"Great tiny house experience! The views were perfect, the hosts were very attentive and inviting, and we overall had an excellent visit. We would absolutely stay again!"
3093,49,So cute! Very peaceful which is exactly what I needed before the baby comes. Thanks for a great weekend!
3094,49,"Michael and Samantha are great and were always making sure we enjoyed our stay, we would definitely be back."
3095,49,Beautiful place with an amazing view of the mountain 10/10 recommend
3096,49,Enjoyed our first tiny-home stay!
3097,49,"Amazing view and awesome place. The house was very clean and welcoming. Well removed from city bustle, the area is worth the drive and quite peaceful. Michael and Samantha were extremely helpful with check in and had great suggestions for activities and food. I would definitely recommend this for a minimalistic and quiet getaway."
3098,49,We cant recommend Michael and Samantha enough! Absolutely beautiful and peaceful property. Wonderful hosts and a wonderful property for a couples getaway!
3099,49,Very nice and neat little place and great view of mountains!
3100,49,"Little Red was an amazing getaway! Super clean and cute. Perfect for a couple’s trip to the beautiful mountains of NC. Plenty of activities in Boone nearby. Awesome morning views of the mountains right out of the front door. The hosts were very polite, responsive, and proactive. A truly unique tiny home experience! Would definitely stay again!"
3101,49,We spent a few nights at this tiny abode to pass the new year and get away from the city. It served as a great launch pad for local hiking and for a getaway. Our hosts went out of their way to respond to questions and even brought an item we needed that wasn't listed in amenities on the listing. Loved the quiet atmosphere and could imagine spending a week there shacked up reading a few books.
3102,49,"This is a very cute and comfy stay for 2 people. It is pictured exactly how it looks on the listing. However, it is an very long drive with narrow roads with lots of twists and turns to get anywhere in the surrounding area. We were not expecting this place to be this far out of the way. Nonetheless, this was still a great trip with beautiful views from the tiny house."
3103,49,"What a serine location! Wonderful views, very peaceful! Enjoyed spotting deer grazing outside thru the front door windows each morning over coffee. Spotless and accommodating. The cutest little place for your getaway!"
3104,49,A truly beautiful and fascinating place to stay. Everything you need for peaceful weekends.
3105,49,Michael and Samantha were incredible hosts. When I had questions they responded with such urgency. They offered to come by if we needed anything at all. So hospitable and kind and even called me to thank me for staying. Best hosts I’ve ever had at a Air B&B. Above and beyond. Can’t wait to come back!
3106,49,"Michael was a gracious host with a very quick response time to questions.The Little Red Tiny house was pristine and peaceful with a gorgeous view. During our stay, we loved just relaxing and enjoying the quiet time with nature. Will definitely be returning to Michael and Samantha’s properties in the future."
3107,49,There's a special place in our hearts for Michael and Samantha's place. A very cozy and warm cabin with an amazing view tucked away on the NC/TN line. The cabin was beautiful and fully functional for two people. It stayed warm and toasty in the low degrees and was easy to find and check into.
3108,49,"We enjoyed our stay. They did a beautiful job with their tiny home, loved the landscaping and the setting. The interior was very neat and clean."
3109,49,"Wonderful, peaceful, and romantic are a few words that describe this awesome tiny home experience! We will be back! To top it off the host are perfect! Responsive, caring, and knowledgeable about the local area! Thank you Michael and Samantha for our first AirBnB experience."

3113,49,"Absolutely loved our little getaway! The house was so cozy and cute. You are not really close to any stores, so I would highly recommend grocery shopping ahead of time. We had so much fun using the grill to make breakfasts and dinners around the fire. Would highly recommend this stay!"
3114,49,"Beautiful tiny home in the mountains! Long drive up the mountain and to town, but that’s to be expected with these types of stays. Plus it’s accessible without a 4x4 vehicle!!!!!"
3115,49,Absolutely loved staying in Micheal and Sams place! It had such a lovely view and the grill and fireplace outside made it super cozy. The inside was charming and we loved the loft bed with unique wooden stairs. I would definitely recommend this place as a secluded getaway to find some quiet and peace. The host was also so kind and helpful!
3116,49,"A modern. well appointed small cabin, perfectly situated. Tucked in the mountains, with all the peace and quiet you desire along with unobstructed views of the mountains. We spent two night here and wish it could've been more. Thanks Michael and Samantha for being great hosts"

3126,49,We loved our stay and couldn’t have asked for a better first tiny home experience!!
3127,49,It was very cozy.

3130,49,The tiny house was super cute and exactly as described. We loved the fire pit and the views from the house were great!

3133,49,This tiny house is everything you need for a great WNC stay! You can't beat the view and proximity to both Boone and Blowing Rock/Grandfather Mtn areas (approx. 30min from each) if you plan to visit other places. Super peaceful stay. Would definitely stay again!

3135,49,"A tiny cabin that grew on me. It’s off the beaten path, but the road behind the property gets a decent amount of traffic. Great communication from the hosts. You can feel how much they want you to enjoy your stay!"
3136,49,The view is breathtaking it is a very clean environment exactly as described I would recommend this to anyone. We had a spectacular time can't wait to go again. Thanks again Mike and Samantha what a great idea you all had
3137,49,"What a wonderful nature-filled week at Little Red Tiny. If you enjoy listening to the crickets and cicadas and hearing owls call at night and gazing across the beauty at Grandfather Mountain and feeling like your living outside but with ALL of the comforts of a snuggly safe home, give this tiny house a try. I would love to stay here again. For a week of hiking in NC, VA, and TN, this location was perfect and absolutely beautiful to drive to all destinations. No matter where I went, I felt like I was in a postcard. A great space in a beautiful place. It is very quiet and private and outside of any town but with a neighbor or two close enough (but not too close). I highly recommend."
3138,49,This wasmy home base while hiking around WNC. It was wonderful. The tiny house is great and the view is phenomenal.
3139,49,Very cute place! Secluded! Nice views!
3140,49,"Expectations were beyond exceeded! This location is beautifully presented with an amazing view, very nicely kept yard with lots of space. The tiny house is very spacious for two people and provides a very calming atmosphere. I will definitely choose location over others the next time I travel in the area."
3141,49,"This tiny home experience did not disappoint! Beautiful location with lovely view. We enjoyed sitting by the fire pit at sunset with a glass of wine. Just perfect. The house itself was cute, cozy and beautifully styled. We enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back and recommend to friends looking for a tiny home experience. Check-in was a breeze and Michael & Samantha even checked in our first morning through the app to see how our stay was going. Excellent hosts!"
3142,49,This is a beautiful and peaceful place to stay! It was very clean and check in was super easy! It’s definitely a great value- I definitely recommend it!
3143,49,"My boyfriend and I are on a cabin hopping this week, and Little Red Tiny did not disappoint at all! The place was clean & cozy.
We went out for a quick visit at Grandfather mtn which is not too far away.
It was rainy during our stay so we weren’t able to use the firepit or outside grill, but everything still went out so smoothly! The highlight for me is waking up in the morning with an amazing view!"
3144,49,"Absolutely gorgeous. Very peaceful, quiet, and beautiful spot. The house was clean and cozy! Michael and Samantha were great hosts very communicative and kind. Close to downtown Boone, perfect spot for a romantic getaway. We will be back!"
3145,49,"Awesome mountain stay! The tiny house itself was beautiful, clean, and comfy. The view was spectacular. It’s a beautiful drive to get there and you are close to great hiking spots. We had the pleasure to meet Michael briefly, he was super friendly and helpful. We loved everything about this place. Safe to say we will be going back!"
3146,49,Little Red Tiny is an amazing vacation place to stay for great getaway with beautiful views. We enjoyed our stay everything was so clean and organized. Michael and Samantha were awesome host and communicated very well!!!

3151,49,"Thank you, Maddie, so much for your kind words! We look forward to hosting you again."
3152,49,Was such a cute place! Amazing views and great location to Boone.

3154,49,"Michael and Samantha were great hosts and were available in a timely manner when needed. The place was very clean, easy to find, and had a wonderful view!"
3155,49,"A beautiful and relaxing place with a wonderful view. A little ways away from town itself, but that just adds to the charm. I would definitely stay there again, if given the opportunity"
3156,49,I loved my time here. It was a beautiful scenic area. I was very comfortable in the home and enjoyed waking up to the birds’ songs.
3157,49,"This is such a great spot! Big fan of the tiny house, and the mountain view is unbeatable. Highly recommend!"
3158,49,"We had such a lovely stay here! The drive up was beautiful, the view was gorgeous, and the house itself was perfect. It had great atmosphere and outside at night, it was dark and quiet enough for incredible star-gazing! We will be back for sure."
3159,49,We are thrilled that you enjoyed your stay in the high country! Thank you for the good review. We hope you visit again soon!
3160,49,The tiny house is beautiful and perfectly comfortable with a great view of the mountains!
3161,49,This tiny home was perfect! The view was amazing and the house so cozy and clean. 100% recommend this place
3162,49,Thank you so much Kasey for your kind words and staying with us!
3163,49,"Wow! Perfect tiny house in a perfect setting ! Michael and Samantha went above and beyond to make our stay memorable. They are landscaping artists !!
Can’t wait to come back!"
3164,49,Micheal and Samantha were amazing hosts! Quickly responded to any questions we had and made our stay a great experience! Clean place with a beautiful view of the maintains. We would come back any time. Just keep in mind the closest city is about 30 min away
3165,49,One of most beautiful sceneries we personally have ever seen with our own eyes. The red tiny is extremely cozy I completely recommend to anyone wondering.
3166,49,Wow! Thank you Brianna!
3167,49,"This is a lovely tiny home with thoughtful, communicative hosts. Easy check in and check out. The propane fire pit is so nice. The shower is a bit difficult to use, but that's my only complaint. Thanks for a great stay!"
3168,49,Really enjoyed my stay at Little Red Tiny. The view was amazing! Perfect little place for a perfect little getaway!
3169,49,"Thank you so much, Amanda, for staying with us in both of our tiny homes! It was a pleasure meeting you and we hope you return soon."
3170,49,The tiny house was clean and neat with a fantastic view. Located in a great spot with plenty of things to do nearby.
3171,49,Had such a relaxing weekend in this beautiful tiny home! I would most definitely want to stay again!
3172,49,Wonderful! We are so glad that you enjoyed your stay. Please come stay with us again soon.
3173,49,The house was incredible! Great location with the most amazing view from the front porch. Couldn’t have asked for a better experience!
3174,49,We are so glad that you loved it! Please come back and stay with us again at Mountainview Tiny or Little Red Tiny.
3175,49,"Absolutely stunning! The place is literally in the mountains and the views are breathtaking. The inside is cute and cozy, very private and we felt safe the entire time we were there. The outside fire pit feature was a huge plus because you get to sit by it and enjoy the beautiful view ahead of you. The hosts were very communicative, caring and helpful—really great people! Overall a great place if you’re planning a little getaway to NC! We 100% would come back!"
3176,49,Thank you Rebeca for your kind words! We look forward to your return.
3177,50,"Super cute farm cottage! Pictures are right on. Very cozy, peaceful, and picturesque."
3178,50,"If you are looking for an adventure, this is for you. We are city folks and wanted to experience something different. We were not disappointed. The weather was horrible. Rained the entire weekend and very chilly. Trips to the outhouse was muddy and filling the bucket to flush was unpleasant. Outside shower was out of the question so we soaked in the hot tub to feel somewhat clean. Warm bodies, cold heads. We had our adventure for sure. We arrived after dark and Lori greeted us to help us get settled in. The cabin is small and looks exactly as pictured. Nearby Mt. Airy and Pilot Mountain filled my wife's shopping itch. Everything about this property was great. I just think hotel stays and cruises have spoiled us. Thank you Lori for sharing your cabin. And we don't blame you for the weather."
3179,50,"I absolutely loved this stay! I stayed solo and felt very safe. It was so peaceful, cozy, and comfortable! At night it was almost magical with the solar lights throughout the property. Some of the special touches I enjoyed were the hosts having a fire pit set up for me each night and fresh eggs in the fridge when I arrived. They had animal feed available to feed the farm animals - this is a must! They are adorable. There was a longer gravel drive to get to the property passing the neighbor with dogs - they didn't bother me, they'll just bark as you drive by slowly. I didn't actually use the hot tub but the set up was cute and private.
The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable and the loft was set up for relaxing and watching television on before bed. About a 15 minute drive to pilot mountain and mount airy for restaurants. About a 45 minute drive to hanging rock - be sure to check out the waterfalls! I will absolutely be staying again and would 100% recommend!"
3180,50,"We loved this rental. I was with my kiddo and she loved it more than I did. Loved the animals and feeding them. Snacks for the animals provided. Private setting even though the owners are close but they give you space. Lori gave us some marshmallows for roasting that we sadly didn’t get to use because of the high winds. She even had some bubbles for us to play with. The lights around the rental at night were cute. Lovely view of the stars. Keep in mind this is partially rustic with the bathroom but Lori explains the process and the toilet is in an outhouse a short walk away, but it is an actually toilet. It’s very cozy and hard to shut the door if have longer legs. But still private enough. Lori was great with communication. The inside of the cabin was great. Running water, AC, and heat. Which we needed both AC and heat for our stay with a high around 80 and a low around 45. The bed was so comfortable. If you want a unique experience, I would most definitely recommend Lori’s place."
3181,50,"Highly recommend this charming farm stay! Everything was as described, and photos can’t capture the beauty of the property and the magical feel of the cottage. Lori and her husband couldn’t be nicer—very responsive but gave me and my dog plenty of space. I’ll never forget the outdoor shower in the rain—no spa could beat it. Would definitely love to stay there again!"
3182,50,"Perfect in every way! Was just what we needed for an affordable night on a road trip. The location was relaxing and peaceful, and the space was very comfortable and nicely decorated. I would stay again and recommend to anyone. Very simple and easy check in and check out as well."
3183,50,"Wow! Lori and Daniel have quite the spot in a beautiful corner of North Carolina. Between the goats, chickens, and pigs, and Lori and Daniel's hospitality - I felt pleasantly at home during my solo getaway. So many highlights of my trip happened right there on the farm. From hearing goat sneezes early in the morning, to a curious chicken following me into my cabin, to being greeted after a long day with three fresh eggs - this was the best stay I've had in awhile. I'm in the process of convincing my mom to follow in my steps and venture out to this farmstay hideaway for some R&R. Lovely spot. Can't wait to come back in the fall."
3184,50,We had the best time at Lori's place! I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great farm experience. Lori and her husband are amazing hosts - very responsive and helpful. The chickens were so friendly - that was my favorite part. Thank you for a great weekend!
3185,50,"This place is like a little magical fairyland! The hosts are incredibly warm and welcoming. We made so many fun, funny, and unforgettable memories here. They thought of every detail, there wasn't one moment where we felt like something was missing! The cottage itself was clean, cozy, and comfortable. The town nearby was cute and had lots to explore. We will absolutely be returning here and recommending to anyone we know looking for a weekend getaway."
3186,50,"We stayed here while on a road trip, and both my guest and I agreed we would be coming back for a lot longer because we absolutely fell in love with the space and with all the wonderful touches that Lori did to make it feel like home. Being able to interact with the animals, having a wonderful hot tub (which Lori was so thoughtful and set up for us as we arrived late), and even having eggs and drinks waiting for us in the fridge were the perfect thing after a long day of driving. Lori was so responsive and flexible when we ended up running into some unexpected traffic and arrived late- she made sure we got in okay and really made sure we had a great time. I cannot recommend this place enough! It was so much fun!!! Thank you!!"
3187,50,Lori’s place is unbelievable. Perfect spot for a cozy getaway. Lori was super responsive and helpful. We’ll definitely be coming back!
3188,50,"The perfect place to stay. We needed a place to stay for a night and we couldn’t have been happier. Great people, very hospitable, and the place was super clean. We got to feed some farm animals and it was the perfect stay away from home. Thanks y’all!"
3189,50,It's very dark in the woods with unclear parking area loose dogs trying to get to my dogs as we were pulling up. Cottage entrance was unclear and I was alone. Requested refund as I couldn't reach host for any help so I left . Was told refund was possible. She charged my card and claimed she wasn't refunding me after all . That is very poor business if you ask me and not fair..I never went inside so I have no information on that .
3190,50,"We are sorry that your stay was not as expected. It does get dark here in the country at night, so there are motion and solar lights to parking and the cottage. There are no loose dogs on the property; though there may be neighbor dogs out near the road on the way.
We did ask that you text or use the Airbnb app to communicate with us and you did not.
When we spoke the next morning we discussed a possible refund of one or both days if you came out to the property in the daytime and let me show you around and let you decide if you wished to continue the reservation. You agreed but then changed your mind and texted your weren’t coming.
I immediately sent you a trip change request so that we could possibly rebook with another guest and refund you for the second night’s stay.
You did not send the request in a timely manner (12 hours) - this means the property could not be made available for another guest- and did not communicate further until the following day.
We are sorry that you weren’t satisfied but we tried in every way to accommodate you short of refunding you for an entire booking at the property that you chose not to tour nor free up for others guests."
3191,50,"Our stay at Lori & Dans was just what we were looking for and needed. Extremely private, cozy, and clean. They were both super friendly and responded within minutes of any questions that we had. From the sneezing goat (Boba) to the little pig escape artists (Dozer and Crash) it was a fun filled weekend that we will gladly visit again! Thanks Guys!"
3192,50,"Had a great stay! Absolutely loved the hot tub. The goats and pigs were precious, and loved the attention. Would definitely stay again! Even the outhouse was decorative and fun. 💛"
3193,50,Wonderful place such an amazing experience even tho it rain one day we still had fun staying in watching movies with our dogs even tho it was scary going to the bathroom at night I loved how quite and nice everything was amazing host thank you guys for giving us an amazing place to stay and welcoming us to your home we loved feeding the animals they are soo cute this was me and my husband first trip of the year alone and we loved the alone time and we loved the thrift stores near by and how everything is so closed just a 15min drive and you are near a lot of food and stores thank you we will definitely be coming back
3194,50,"we had a great time, thanks again!!"
3195,50,We really enjoyed our stay. We are looking forward to going back when the weather warms up. The hot tub was nice and warm. The ambiance of the cottage was perfect for us. It was a warm and peaceful setting.
3196,50,Piggies!! And goats. And chickens. This place was absolutely perfect. The cabin is cozy and quiet. The bed is super comfortable and perfect for snuggling. The animals were a bonus and all friendly. Lori left chicken scratch and goat snacks outside the door and the animals were excited to let us feed them. As an added bonus Lori left fresh eggs in the cabin for us to make breakfast with. We wish we could have stayed longer and hope to come back someday.
3197,50,"This is my new favorite Airbnb. Lori's offerings perfectly straddle the line between providing travelers with both a colorful experience and cozy, comfortable accommodations. Lori and her husband are both incredibly friendly and accommodating people, and interacting with them was a pleasure. The cottage itself is functional for any travelers' needs, complete with a fun and warm aesthetic, comfy linens, a kitchenette counter with a sink and cooking appliances, and fast wifi. There is a Roku with complementary Netflix, and the kitchenette came full of goodies (Including some farm fresh eggs for our morning). The outhouse, outdoor shower, and hot tub are clean and well-maintained, and offer plenty of privacy. Charcoal was provided for the fire pit outside of the cottage. Guests are even given jars of animal feed and have the opportunity to meet and feed the family pigs, goats, and chickens in the daytime. My wife and I are already excited for our next stay at this cottage."
3198,50,"This cottage was perfect for a little getaway. It was like glamping but without the tent. Lori was a wonderful host and was very communicative. The outhouse was something to get used to, but it absolutely added to the whole experience. Also, the hot tub in cold weather hit on a whole different level. I highly recommend this cozy cottage to anyone that wants to get away for a few days. I will absolutely be returning in the future."
3199,50,If you're looking for peace and tranquility this is the place. Wild animals help too.
3200,50,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this small but comfortable cabin. Pigs, goats, and chickens outside door, and the hosts provide jars of feed so you can feed them, which was fun. Trail to river was a nice walk on the property, and hot tub worked great with beautiful view of starry sky. The hosts are around but give you privacy and are very friendly if you choose to talk with them! I had never been to Mt. Airy and had a blast exploring the town. We also hiked a trail at Pilot Mountain State Park. Definitely recommend."
3201,50,"Lori’s place is so cute! While it is small & rustic, it is warm, cozy, & beautifully decorated. The bed is comfortable. It is quiet & peaceful. I appreciated the thoughtful details (esp the fresh eggs & doggy snack). The hot tub was heavenly. Although the owners’ house is nearby, the place still feels very private. The outhouse was def an adventure-esp in freezing temps. I loved the cute, friendly pigs & goats! I’ll definitely come back when it’s warmer, & I have more time to explore the farm/trails!"
3202,50,"Such a beautiful place to be, from the cozy touches inside to the relaxing hot tub and shower outside! Super responsive, respectful and kind hosts as well."
3203,50,"Wonderful place to stay, very relaxing and peaceful. Lori was very responsive and made excellent recommendations for local attractions. The animals were adorable and very friendly."
3204,50,My boyfriend and I had an amazing stay. It was the perfect place to stop on our road trip.
3205,50,"My boyfriend and I stayed for the new years weekend. We LOVED our stay. The hot tub alone made it worth the price. Adorable on the inside, Lori was a great host and very friendly and attentive. Would definitely stay again."
3206,50,"A wonderful experience staying here! So comfortable and beautiful! I highly recommend it to anyone wanting a bucolic setting. The hot tub was great, especially at night when the stars are out! Loved every minute of it!"
3207,50,"Lori & Daniel’s place was the perfect place for my partner & I to stay while visiting family in the Yadkin Valley. We came for Christmas during a polar vortex. Lori & Daniel ensured we were warm enough & had everything we needed. We probably would only come back in warmer weather so we could enjoy the amenities more, but we definitely recommend!"
3208,50,"This was the perfect weekend getaway for us and our pups! We loved hiking on the property with our dogs, chilling in the hot tub, and feeding the goats and pigs! Lori was the absolute sweetest and I loved her personal touches on the cabin we stayed in. It was so cozy!"
3209,50,"Amazing Airbnb, absolutely blew expectations away with the attention to detail inside the cabin. We spent the first 20 minutes just enjoying how cute it was. Enjoyed exploring downtown mt airy and the trail available on the property!"
3210,50,Very sweet and lots of great details in the cottage - I can tell it was thoughtfully set up! Would definitely recommend this Airbnb!
3211,50,"what a beautiful getaway we were just passing thru and we booked in with them and we absolutely love it 😊😊☺️ we want it to stay one more night and it was already booked because it was gorgeous 😍🥰 and all the details were perfect 😍we love the animals, the river walk and the peaceful of the place 😊"
3212,50,"Oh my goodness, those bells didn’t last a minute with those crazy goats! I’m glad your dog could use it hahaa☺️☺️☺️"
3213,50,Such a cute place and great host! They were beyond accommodating and everything was so cozy even on a chilly night. The check in details were exactly as told and communication stayed great throughout!
3214,50,Lori’s place the perfect place for our short getaway. The cottage was adorable and had everything we needed. It was safe clean and comfortable. The hot tub worked great and we had so much fun seeing all the animals! We would definitely rebook :)
3215,50,"We had a lovely time, the hosts were great, the cabin and areas were all beautiful plus everything you would need is there for you. They thought of everything. The Netflix fireplace was going and the cabin was very welcomIng on a rainy day. We stayed 2 nights and totally rested up. Went to cousin Gary’s to eat the breakfast buffet which was good too. The cabin is private even though you aren’t far from the hosts house. Literally never saw them except to say hello a couple times. Very friendly people, they made us feel comfortable and taken care of. The best part was the sneezing goat.. he was hilarious and seeing them was fun! The baby pigs were adorable!! We recommend this place & would love to stay again (maybe on a sunny day next time) Thank you for a great weekend."
3216,50,"Cutest little cottage with a great view, has everything you need and has a very cozy atmosphere. Goats are the best!!!! Definitely planning on coming back."
3217,50,"I arrived at Lori's farm on a dreary cold day after having driven for about 9 hours, and was greeted by a warm, cozy space with the thoughtful touch of a Netflix fire video on the TV :) This little cabin is pure magic - the farm is beautiful and Lori has done so much to make the house as comfortable as possible with everything you need. Even the outhouse has cute little touches. Lori was very communicative and I felt very welcome to reach out if I needed anything - but everything I needed was already provided! Thanks for sharing this beautiful property, Lori!"
3218,50,"This was the most peaceful perfect stay in North Carolina! Very private, clean! This Airbnb tops any other place I’ve been hands down! The owner’s took the time to make sure the cabin is equipped with everything you can ask or even think to have in your Airbnb! Also provided fresh eggs to cook in the Am in your very equipped mini kitchen! A ton of detail was put into this stay! Owner’s were also quick to respond and very pleasant to communicate with! They definitely make you feel very welcome and at home! Almost like visiting family! :) I can’t put into words how nice this place is from the hot tub to the outhouse! You have to come visit for yourself, you wouldn’t want to leave! Guaranteed! Thanks again for such a wonderful stay on the farm!"
3219,50,Super cute house! Loved the hot tub. Bed was really cozy. Perfect for a getaway weekend. The communication was great!
3220,50,Loved it here it was our first trip with our dog and he enjoyed it so much. So beautiful and if you love to walk through the woods and look at nature this is the place for you. Can’t wait to come back for another weekend away
3221,50,"That's exactly what my wife and I were looking for this weekend. Lori's cottage was beautifully and artistically decorated and it was super clean too!
We enjoyed the short hike to Ararat river. Our dog enjoyed it a lot. There were a couple of access points where he got to splash around in the water. The goats were very friendly and the chicken looked happy roaming around. The fresh eggs Lori offered us were very appreciated!
The location is great too; it's close to Pilot mountain, Hanging Rock and Mount Airy.
We would definitely stay there again if we got a chance!"
3222,50,"You guys were such wonderful guests- Kiwi, too (I’m so glad he had fun!), it was a pleasure hosting you all; would love to host you again any time!"
3223,51,"Great place, very peaceful and great accommodations. It was the perfect place for a weekend getaway!"
3224,51,"Awesome stay! Location was perfect, the views from the porch were the best I've seen. Everything was super clean, it's the perfect spot for exploring Asheville and the Smokies"
3225,51,"we had a wonderful stay here!! my husband and I wanted a short getaway for my 30th birthday and this was the perfect spot. the view was absolutely breath-taking, the kitchen was so cute with the retro appliances, the bathroom was something that dreams are made of, and it was just all around amazing. the TV was on a rolling cart so we could move it in front of the bed, and the Murphy bed was comfy! there were a lot of good restaurants nearby (highly recommend Angelo's italian). we didn't use the hot tub bc of some medical issues but we were definitely eye balling it the whole time! I texted the owners a couple of times and immediately got a response. highly recommend!!"
3226,51,"What an AMAZING, RELAXING location. If you are wanting a quiet, relaxing and cozy getaway then look no further. The studio was perfect and comfortable. Our entire stay was perfect from start to finish.

Would love to come back during the fall and see the beautiful landscape. We had a wonderful romantic getaway and just looking forward to being able to come back."
3227,51,"Great place. I would love to stay here again. It's very nicely decorated. The shower is huge and relaxing. The murphy bed is unique and was comfortable. The view of the surrounding mountains is fantastic! The Samsung Frame has an amazing picture. There is even a mini disc frisbee course on the lot (I won't give away the details - but it was fun and sounded great when you completed a hole!). Easy quick access to groceries, shopping and restaurants; however, back at the cabin you feel away from the hustle. No guilt in doing nothing or getting motivated to jump in the hot tub, swing in the tree swing, go on a hike, or read a book - it was all good."
3228,51,"awesome stay, one of the best airbnbs I've had the pleasure of staying in."
3229,51,Second time staying here and it did not disappoint!!! Love the privacy and the luxury of this place. Can’t wait to stay again!
3230,51,"great little place. we enjoyed our stay, minus the unfortunate weather we had in our stay. The only thing of note is the inside part of the door handle wanted to keep coming off, we just put it back on each time."
3231,51,Thank you for letting us know about the door handle John - we will get that taken care of.
3232,51,We went for our wedding anniversary and it was a perfect weekend getaway!! Everything was exactly as the listing. The view was breathtaking and the cabin was adorable! Wonderful stay!
3233,51,"Such an amazing mountain stay! The cabin is so cute and very clean. Bed was super comfortable. I would bring shower shoes just because the rocks can be a little uncomfortable and the cold water pools, spacious shower though! It is pretty dark outside if arriving in the evening. The walkway up to the cabin is lit up. Overall such a great location with great views!"
3234,51,James and Kristie are the best hosts! The cabin is cozy and quiet. Great for a relaxing get away and still close to town.
3235,51,This place is definitely worth the money. The cabin is fully stocked with kitchen and bathroom needs. The view is amazing and is only a short drive to town/hiking trails. The bed is more comfortable than expected. The hosts were also on top of everything and respond quick when something comes up.
3236,51,Absolutely stunning place. I wish I had booked it for longer! Perfect location and had everything I needed.
3237,51,Pictures just don’t do it justice! The place was truly beautiful. Would recommend to others!
3238,51,"We had an amazing time at this place! My husband and I were looking for a romantic getaway near smoky mountain National park and this fit the bill! We would go on a long hike. Then return for grilling, fire, and a quick hot tub session. It was absolutely relaxing and exactly what we needed."
3239,51,"Stayed here for mine and my boyfriends 5 year anniversary and it was a lovely stay! We enjoyed every minute of it and loved them area. Exactly as described, perfect view, and the most comfiest bed! Definitely would recommend this place to any and everyone:)"
3240,51,"Thank you for hosting my parents. It was a beautiful, peaceful stay."
3241,51,Beautiful view. Relaxing place to stay.
3242,51,"This place is special! The amazing views and hot tub are perfect for relaxing and enjoying the mountains. The location is great, remote but close to grocery stores, hikes, the blue ridge parkway, and easy access to get to Asheville. The cabin is cozy but has everything you need."
3243,51,"This cabin is just beautiful and the pictures don’t do it justice! It was secluded and still very close to town, we couldn’t have picked a better place!"
3244,51,This was the mist relaxing beautiful place I have stayed. It was just what we needed to get away from the hustle and bustle. Waynesville was cute and quite. You can tell they are in a revival phase but i was so happy yo be there when it wasn’t so crazy. If crowds are what you want and lots of activities this may not be the place but if you want to get away from it all book immediately!!Y inly suggestion would be to have a code to be able to send electronically for the house cleaners as I never have cash in hand and would have liked to tip them!
3245,51,"Beautiful, stylish and fully equipped cabin with everything you could wish for. Immensely comfortable bed and spacious bathroom. Such a stunning setting in the forest! We’d love to come back…."
3246,51,"This was a
Wonderful home that we loved spending time in. The location is great, although you will lose cell reception about a mile out from the house, but their WiFi works great! Recommend for any couple looking to get away."
3247,51,Great for a romantic getaway! We’ve stayed twice and will definitely stay again!
3248,51,Quiet and peaceful.
3249,51,"Great mountain getaway! My husband and I spent our honeymoon here. Waynesville is an awesome little town with great restaurants, shops, and more. Beautiful scenery, privacy, drivable to Asheville and the Biltmore Estate.

The morning view of the mountains, the hot tub, fire pit, and Tuscan feel of the cabin made it a great romantic getaway!
Highly recommend!"
3250,51,Awesome place in a great location!
3251,51,"What a beautiful place to spend a few days in a lovely place, enjoying privacy, and nature. It's easy to see that James and Kristie have gone above and beyond to make their place a one-of-a-kind experience and my husband and I enjoyed our time here. Waynesville was a cute town to spend some time in to shop and catch a bite to eat. The area is beautiful and we spent several days driving the Blue Ridge Parkway, hiking, and checking out Asheville and Sylva. James and Kristie have created a great place to relax and rejuvenate in style."
3252,51,"Perfection! Keep an eye out every night around 8:45 pm for the owl in the large tree in front of the deck. We saw him twice over our week stay, such a treat! We loved being located right in between all of the popular sights - smokeys, blue ridge mountains, Asheville ect."
3253,51,"This is a great, quiet getaway! My wife and I came here to relax after our wedding and it was perfect. The kitchen is well stocked, which was great for cooking. And it’s not a far drive to Asheville and some great trailheads in the Smokies. Host is super communicative. We had a great time!"
3254,51,This is a perfect place! Book it! It’s worth it!
3255,51,"Great mountain retreat! Easy accessibility to the GSMNP and Ashville, NC. The hosts are considerate, clean, and offer a great view of the surrounding mountains."
3256,51,fantastic stay! and a GORGEOUS view
3257,51,Great get away. Little pricey but the hosts were very accommodating. It was a great place to go to get away from things.
3258,51,An amazing place
3259,51,"Cannot say enough about this stay! It was a fabulous choice for our anniversary trip. The location was perfect, not too far from town but it felt like we were in a world of our own. We felt right at home - anything we needed was made available. The view is breathtaking and the cabin was stunning. We would love to visit again!"
3260,51,Impeccable property with amazing views. The accommodations set up by the host allows you to begin enjoying your stay immediately. Perfect property to enjoy for your entire stay or use as a base camp to enjoy several outings from the local area. We will visit again!
3261,51,My husband and I spent our honeymoon here & it was fantastic!
3262,51,Great stay! Loved the views and the access to the hot tub. Very unique property!
3263,51,"Amazing place definitely a must stay if your visiting the area! Great views, awesome setup, clean, hot tub facing Mountain View and fire pit!! Will definitely be returning in the future!"
3264,51,We had a great time. We loved the area and the town was really nice and reminded us of home. The views were fantastic and the hot tub was 10/10.
3265,51,"What an amazing view from a very well appointed home. Secluded property, luxury furnishings, can't say enough good things about this place. Can't wait to come back."
3266,51,We absolutely loved this cabin! Incredible views and every detail of this place was completely perfect. Even things we didn’t expect. They went out of their way to ensure our stay was at the highest premium and communicated all details well ahead of time. We highly recommend this place for a romantic getaway you’ll never forget.
3267,51,"This was our second time staying here - we love it! It’s beautiful, a true getaway. Even with lots of rain, it’s cozy and comfortable. We will be back - again!"
3268,51,"Absolutely fantastic. Completely isolated — didn’t see a single soul other than three or four cars driving up the road.

Murphy bed is shockingly comfortable — absolutely no issue sleeping. Bathroom is incredible. Hot tub as advertised. Absolutely zero complaints with any of it. Would stay again and will recommend for folks I know nearby."
3269,51,Peaceful and quaint cabin in a location convenient to downtown Waynesville. Great amenities and exactly as described. It was exactly what we were looking for on our anniversary getaway weekend.
3270,51,"This cabin was absolutely beautiful. The views are stunning, and the cabin is amazing. You can tell a lot of thought was put into making the cabin wonderful, and we appreciated it all. After a day of hiking, we loved coming back to the cabin to enjoy the hot tub or deck area. The shower & bathroom is gorgeous, and the kitchen appliances are awesome. The Murphy bed has such cool features as well. I loved all of the details of this place. We hope to come back!"
3271,51,"My wife and I chose this property for a “mini-moon” escape after our wedding, and we could not have been happier! It was a perfect mix of seclusion while still being close to necessities and James was on top of everything we needed without fail. We cannot recommend this property enough!"
3272,51,"The views are breathtaking, and the cabin is SO cute! My husband and I stayed a few days while on our mini honeymoon traveling in the mountains and this was the perfect place to get away but still close to Asheville. Waynesville also has a nice little Main Street for shopping/dinner/drinks.
The hosts have literally thought of everything here, it’s by far our favorite Airbnb we’ve been to. Everything is labeled and screenshots so theirs no confusion, the hosts also had wonderful instructions on getting there, getting in, they made brownies! We were iffy on the pull down bed and it was ridiculously comfortable. Perfect romantic little honeymoon spot:)"
3273,52,"Had an enjoyable stay, everything was nice and private!"
3274,52,The place was beautiful and very clean! The hosts were responsive and friendly. Definitely recommend this place!
3275,52,"Had a wonderful stay, enjoyed the hot tub the most. Very private and perfect for a get away."

3277,52,A great place for a quiet getaway! Truly wonderful hosts that accommodated to all the concerns we had! Recommend this spot for everyone.

3280,52,Everything was so neat and Tim and Carrie had great food recommendations. It was such a comfortable and peaceful space after a long day around Wilmington. Will definitely be back!
3281,52,"The place is so cute and cozy. Everything was great. Perfect as it’s name says it “the great escape” it was just that for us. The hut tub was my favorite part of our stay. The only little thing we had was about the heater, it refused to work on our last night. Apart from that everything was great!"
3282,52,Amazing place to stay especially for couples!
3283,52,The hot tub and string lights outside were the highlight of this stay! We really enjoyed our time here.
3284,52,"This was the best experience that I have ever had with an Air BnB. Everything was laid out so nicely, and the decor of the home was to die for. The expectation was exceeded and much more and I am thankful for the time we had there. The hot tub was the main attraction to the home and yet a very much well needed piece. I would recommend this home to anyone to try in the Wilmington North Carolina area it is worth every penny."
3285,52,Great place. Just as advertised. Loved it!
3286,52,"Great space. It is attached to their family home, not loud but worth noting. They’re great hosts, this wasn’t our favorite of their locations but good nonetheless. There were multiple bees/wasps and mosquitoes in the outdoor area that made it slightly hard to relax in the hot tub but that may just be cause it is at the beach. Overall a good stay."
3287,52,very nice place
3288,52,"I only stayed one night just to have a small getaway but this place was perfect! Convenient location, not too far from the beach and around great places to eat. The vibe at this house was perfect and I will definitely be coming back to stay again. ❤️"
3289,52,"Perfect little weekend getaway! VERY CLEAN! Pics are exactly what you get. Super cute little spot and made you feel at home. Quiet and private. The hot tub was wonderful too! Tim & Carrie were great at communicating all the details, making check-in/out painless.

10 / 10 stay!"
3290,52,Beautiful space and great hosts
3291,52,It was great! Loved the hot tub and the privacy
3292,52,Everything was great.
3293,52,Nice little getaway for 2!
3294,52,Had an amazing stay with my girlfriend in Wilmington at Tim and Carrie’s. The hot tub area was great and got to catch up on my book in the hammock! Highly recommend best bang for the buck couple stay.
3295,52,Had a wonderful weekend celebrating my husbands birthday at The Great Escape! It was very clean and nicely decorated. We loved soaking in the hot tub. Very private and peaceful. Tim and Carrie were excellent hosts and we would love to return!
3296,52,"This place is a little gem! My husband and I had a free weekend and we wanted to getaway to the beach for a couple of days. It really is the perfect ""landing spot"" for the weekend, and the hottub is a huge bonus. Everything was as described, if not even better!"
3297,52,Just as described; it's a cute studio space. The yard and hot tub area were private even though the house is on the corner lot. Very happy and would certainly stay there again.
3298,52,"The place was very cute, cozy, and well maintained. I enjoyed my stay."
3299,52,"Everything as promised, the hot tub was very relaxing and a lot of thought was put in to making the place feel like home. Great distance from everything in Wilmington and Wrightsville Beach!"
3300,52,Would recommend 100%
3301,52,Great place to stay. The hosts are very sweet and easy to get in touch with. Beautiful little place with a nice hot tub and a very comfortable bed. Well worth the money!
3302,52,Awesome! Relaxing and pretty.
3303,52,The house was gorgeous! Very clean and tidy….smelled wonderful! Hosts were extremely welcoming and accommodating. The private hot tub was amazing! My husband and I will definitely be back in the future!
3304,52,"This place was just what my fiancé and I needed for a short getaway. Cozy, inexpensive, and close to the city."
3305,52,Good place to lay your head for the night. Location was the biggest perk of this place in regard to how close it was to downtown Wilmington (just a short Lyft or Uber). Also close to Mayfaire.
3306,52,great place in a great neighborhood.
3307,52,"Is small and comfortable, and the instructions were clear. all the questions I did have were all written on paper, so I didn't have to bother them. wasn't far from the town or the beach. It was wonderful, had no problem what's so ever. it was very decorative."
3308,52,"This was the perfect place to relax and unwind. It provided a quick stop for the night, was very clean and really private and quiet. I loved the hot tub and the beach was so close it was well worth the pit-stop. Thank you Tim and Carrie!"
3309,52,"Rental is as-advertised. Comfortable, clean, and the hot tub and private courtyard are perfect!"
3310,52,"Great place to stay for a short trip! It’s a quick drive to the beach, and the home itself is very clean with great amenities."
3311,52,We just wanted a relaxing place to stay. It was approx 5 miles from Wrightsville Beach and the same to downtown Wilmington. Convenient location in our eyes. Will definitely see if this place is open then next time we in the area for a weekend getaway or a vacation.
3312,52,"Beautiful place, comfortable bed, and so clean!

The hot tub had enough chlorine in it that I had an allergic reaction (stinging eyes, burning skin in a few areas) and couldn’t stay in for more than a few minutes, which hasn’t happened to me before, but this might not be a problem for everyone.

I loved the high ceilings and the lovely details everywhere, including the makeup towels! Really a great stay."
3313,52,"I stay here often when in town visiting my parents.
Lovely place"
3314,52,It was amazing
3315,52,"Everything was just as described, and I had a great stay here."
3316,52,We came here for our mini honeymoon before Christmas and it was absolutely perfect! This is the cutest Airbnb I have ever stayed at and the location was perfect! Hosts were very responsive and gave us their recommendations of things to do and places to eat in the area. I love this Airbnb and its perfect location! Highly recommend for anyone looking for a nice comfortable getway!
3317,52,My boyfriend and I needed a place for one night and it was just what we needed! It was very clean and cozy and the hot tub is in great condition.
3318,52,"Such a lovely escape ! The home looks exactly like the pictures, everything was tidy, and wifi worked great — which is a must for me ! Clear instructions are provided for everything you may need.

The hosts are very nice and responsive. LOVE the hot-tub feature. Private and quite neighborhood.
Will surely return!"
3319,52,My husband and I stayed here for a night away just the two of us and it was perfect. Very private and quiet while still being convenient to everything we wanted to do. It was well stocked and exactly as described. We would definitely return :)
3320,52,It was a lovely little spot. Great for a couple who wants to have some fun and a little escape where they stay. The hot tub area is clutch.
3321,52,Will definitely book again. Had an amazing experience.
3322,52,Great stay!! Highly recommend if you’re visiting Wilmington
3323,52,Awesome place to stay. Beautiful and relaxing inside!
3324,52,Great place. Central to downtown Wilmington as well as Wrightsville beach. We enjoyed our stay there. the hot tub is a wonderful addition.
3325,52,"Enjoyed our weekend getaway in Wilmington at this cozy place, nice and clean. Def took advantage of the hot tub soaks! Only there for a short period of time, but our stay was most comfortable."
3326,52,Great place to stay and have a relaxed couple days!
3327,52,"Great cozy place that’s near a lot! They had recommended restaurants with descriptions and how close they were! Love the outdoor area with lights around the hot tub, very aesthetically pleasing!"
3328,52,"Tim and Carrie did an amazing job at making such a small space feel so comfortable and cozy! I really appreciate the fact that we could check in at 2pm. I would love to stay here again, the bed and sheets were so comfortable and the hot tub was clean and relaxing. I can’t wait to plan another date night with my husband here. This might sound crazy but they even provided good toilet paper! Often people skimp on certain items like that but they did not! Additionally, I love how they had a make up removal towel. I hate staying places and getting makeup on their white towels.

The only thing I wish they had was a Keurig/coffee bar. I would have loved to wake up and enjoy coffee near or inside the hot tub in the morning before check out. This isn’t a complaint though, I would stay again regardless of this. Next time, I would just bring my own.

Lastly, the decor inside was so beautiful! I really can’t say enough about this Arbnb. Thank you so much for making our night so memorable."
3329,52,"Tim & Carrie have done a very nice job in making a cozy and private space.
My husband and I enjoyed our stay!"
3330,52,Stayed for one nigh while in town. Would definitely return!
3331,52,"Everything is accurate and correct as advertised. The location was inside a neighborhood but it wasn't a problem finding it on the map.

Where the hot tub is, that part was fenced off and well taken care of. It was very neatly decorated and was very peaceful at night, as well as the neighborhood being quite.

I gotta say this is one of very few Airbnbs that have their kitchen utensils cleaned and ready for use, usually I check a couple plates and utensils and they looked like they haven't been washed since the last use.

The bed was very comfortable and is great for 2 people. The tv placement may seem like it's not ideal since it's on the right side of the wall next to the bed, but you could rotate it and fix it to your liking so that cancelled that out.

This Airbnb is inside a house and their is a family living there but during our stay we heard nothing through the walls and also had no loud or disturbing noises.

Over all it was very well cleaned and separated from the rest of the house. I would book again, Tim and Carrie are great hosts, friendly, and super nice. I would book again if I stayed in that area again!"
3332,52,Cute little back house 😍 Hot tub was so nice and such a little outdoor oasis. Super clean as well! Thanks for the great stay!
3333,52,Perfect for some alone time or a couples weekend. Nice neighborhood and very secluded.
3334,52,"I had such an awesome time here! So close to downtown Wilmington and Wrightsville beach. So cute, cozy and clean. Absolutely recommend!"

3336,52,Amazing place
3337,52,"This stay was incredible! Location was perfect, close enough to downtown but not so close that you hear the traffic. Loved the decor, the hot tub."

3339,52,Really nice and clean. perfect for 1 or 2 people. very private and close to everything. would definitely recommend if you're looking for a place in wilmington.

3344,52,"We stayed here for my husbands first 70.3 Ironman and the location, comfort and hottub was everything we needed. Tim and Carrie were thorough with communications so we had no issues getting there and getting settled."
3345,52,"Tim and Carrie have a lovely place! This is perfect for the weary traveler and made us wish we were staying longer. The hot tub was a dream, the decor was inviting, and the tv had lots of options. Would definitely stay here again if coming through."

3360,52,Fantastically beautiful and near everything. I look forward to returning in the near future.
3361,52,The jacuzzi has a lot of chlorine and it was burning our eyes and our nose was runny. Maybe invest in some ice cube trays as well but other than that… everything was AMAZING. We LOVED it and thank you all ❤️.
3362,52,Beautiful little room for a beach getaway!
3363,52,"Loved it - very clean and quiet and very convenient location.
Would for sure stay again."
3364,52,"Super Clean in Smells Amazing! Very Quiet neighborhood! The Patio HOTTUB gets a 10 in my book, having different areas on the body that the jets hit just enough to relax you. I slept like a Newborn!
I can't wait to come back!!
Thanks Guys!!"
3365,52,"This stay was perfect for my boyfriend and I’s quick weekend getaway. The pictures were very spot on. There was a private entrance to the stay and it was very easy to get to. The stay was attached to the host house. However, we could not hear them at all. The hot tub was right outside and fenced in for a private relaxing area. This place was literally just so perfect! About 15-20 minute drive to Wrightsville beach but plenty around."
3366,52,"Great location, you can drive to the beach in under 15 mins. So many restaurants near by."
3367,52,"We had the best time during our stay here! We had everything we needed and it’s in a great central location. Minutes from the beach, close to lots of restaurants, and shopping. We explored the cargo district, the river walk, historic Wilmington, and the beach. The best part of this weekend was the beautiful porch covered in grapevines for our morning coffee. Would definitely recommend this place to everyone looking to stay in the area!"
3368,52,"Beautiful place to stay. Quiet neighborhood very close to restraunts, grocery stores, and downtown Wilmington. Very clean and well maintained. Only issue was the hot tub being over chlorinated to point we couldn't use it but I'm sure this is not a normal occurrence considering how well the airbnb is taken care of."
3369,52,Looks amazing inside and the outside hot tub area is a real vibe 🙂
3370,52,"such a wonderful place to stay. the hot tub area is so inviting. when I walked Inside, the room truly met my expectations. Tim & Carrie communicated well. if you are looking for and affordable place to stay a short drive from many of the area beaches and waterways this definitely is the place to stay!"
3371,52,"This place is amazing and was worth every penny! The hot tub was perfect, having a private fenced area added to the beach getaway. The location was conveniently close to the boardwalk, rides, and parking. The pictures don’t do justice, the place is very spacious. Would definitely recommend to any future guest and I would stay again."
3372,52,Love the hot tub
3373,52,Enjoyed
3374,52,"This was a great place. It’s close to just about everything. The hot tub was great and the unit itself is a cozy little 1 bed room, 1 bathroom space great for couples"
3375,52,"Clean, comfortable guest house with a really cute outdoor area. Convenient to restaurants and shopping. Definitely better than staying at a hotel."
3376,52,We loved this place! So clean!
3377,52,Great place to stay for one night in town! Quiet and cozy. We enjoyed our time away from home exploring wilmington.
3378,53,"My husband and I immediately relaxed the minute we pulled up to the Water Retreat! The view is outstanding! Big picture windows framed the river outside. We spotted a bald eagle, and enjoyed a gorgeous sunset with cold drinks left by the hosts! Fishing off the decks was great fun! We enjoyed eating and shopping in historic Swansboro. Our hosts left us delicious eggs and bagels and plenty of spices to cook a wonderful breakfast. The chairs, sofa and bed were extremely comfortable and cozy! Thank you for such a wonderful weekend!"
3379,53,We had a wonderful stay at the Water Lover’s retreat! Amazing views and sunsets. There’s a lot to do in the surrounding area as well. We can’t wait to come back!
3380,53,This was our first Airbnb stay and it didn’t disappoint. Dianne was wonderful and helpful. The cottage was just as described and even better than expected. My husband and I felt at home and said we will definitely stay here again!
3381,53,So pleased your first Airbnb visit was such a success and thank you for the great review.
3382,53,"This was one of the best AirBnB experiences that Rosannne and I have ever had. The cottage is cozy and perfect for two. The entire front wall has windows overlooking the beautiful White Oak River and estuary. Dianne was so helpful and responsive to our needs. Ron helped me get used to the kayaks and gave me great advice on fishing the mouth of the river and the local creeks.
We both enjoyed the kayaks. Rosanne and I both spent time in the wildlife preserve at Cedar Point. Rosannne was able to see two new bird species and got several great pictures.
We just scratched the surface of what we can do in the area. We WILL be back!"
3383,53,Thank you for your great review and will take care of your request in the am. Cheers and happy holidays. Dianne
3384,53,"Loved staying here, wonderful place to kayak.... very peaceful."
3385,53,So happy you enjoyed and thank you again.
3386,53,"Okay, let me start by saying that all of the 5 star reviews are well deserved. This house has everything mentioned in the listing and more. From our first contact with Dianne, it's been an absolute pleasure with every contact. The house was perfect for our getaway! We arrived later in the day, just in time to see our first sunset. The bread and fresh cut flowers were nice and the snacks held us over while deciding on a place to eat and we found many options in the house manual/guest book. Our first sunrise was more spectacular than the previous sunset. (Amazing that you can see both while enjoying the view from this house!)

Everything was taken care of for our stay. I think we could have arrived with our clothes and the rest was there; even breakfast for our first morning. The house is well stocked with quality items throughout; kitchen has nice dishes and pans, living room with blankets, bedding was very comfortable with plenty of pillows, bathroom has nice towels and all the needed amenities. There's even a CD player with CD's.

If you're going to be anywhere near Swansboro, do yourself a favor and stay with Ron and Dianne."
3387,53,Thank you Shane for the high praise. Also for the excellent feedback regarding the extra mirror and I know exactly where to place.
3388,53,"Water Lover's Retreat is a well planned, well equipped, very quiet and well located retreat for one to base their sightseeing and adventuring near the Crystal Coast and the towns of Swansboro and Beaufort."
3389,53,"Thank you Chris, your positive feedback regarding the attention to detail is appreciated."
3390,53,You wonder when you read reviews before going somewhere and every one is a 5.0 and is so complementary in every category if it can be true. Turns out it is. Wonderful stay. Look forward to the next one.
3391,53,So pleased you enjoyed and look forward to your next visit.
3392,53,"We found this cottage 5 years ago and now we have finally visited it. We found it just after our vacation in 2017 and made already plans for a new trip for 2018 and booked it right away.

Hurricane Florence literally blew the plans away and we didn’t make the trip to Swansboro and stayed in Atlanta. In 2019 we went to an other country and, you know why, it was not able to travel to the USA in 2020 and 2021.

I have to mention that this is not the first time I visited this place several times the first time was back in the mid 90’s and the last time was in 2005. I was so glad that I would be able to visit it again and now I could show it to my partner. It was really worth waiting.

First of all the hosts are great! The communication through the years went very smooth and easy with a quick response. They were also very helpful and a lot of information is available. It was very nice to meet them in real life. Despite the fact that their own house is close by, you have complete privacy. The unique selling point of this charming cottage is the location, the view over the White Oak river is wonderful.

It is a wonderful place to relax and unwind. In the early morning we spotted a few times the dolphins. The cottage was spotless clean and a lot of amenities were present as well in the kitchen as the bathroom. All you could wish fore is there. The freshly baked bread was delicious and the best bread we have eaten during our stay. The swivel chair in front of the window gives you the opportunity to enjoy a wonderful view of the water. The bed was very comfortable.

In the evening it is wonderful to listen to the rippling water on the veranda.
It is recommended to use the kayaks that are available on the private pier. Try it a few times and before you know it you kayak to Jones Island across the Creek with beautiful small beaches.

If you want to see more of the area you can visit the charming city of Swansboro or go to the beach in Emerald Isle which is just a short drive of 15 minutes. You can reach the nearby grocery store in just 10 minutes and on the key chain there is even a reward card.

Dear Dianne and Ron, thank you for giving us a very special stay!
Robert & Jasper"
3393,53,So pleased you enjoyed the bread and thank you for the wonderful review. How fun to see the deer as you were leaving.
3394,53,"Dianne and Ron have been exceptional hosts. The cottage was in impeccable condition, with plenty of food for us to start our stay, super well equipped and with all details taken care of. The view is spectacular, they were very helpful with the pedal kayaks and board paddles and they were instrumental for us to have an unforgettable Labor Day weekend. We strongly recommend this property for your stay, and we’ll be back!"
3395,53,Thank you for the lovely review. So pleased you enjoyed. Look forward to seeing you again.
3396,53,"We have stayed at many air b&b / Vrbo places over the years & Dianne’s place was top notch. Her little touches made it special & very welcoming. Lovely spot right on the intercostal. We kayaked right out in front of the cottage to Jones Island & saw lots of fish, dolphins, birds, etc. Only about 15 minutes drive to a public beach access on Emerald Isle. Cottage was perfect & was 5 star plus all the way! All you really need are your own personal items & Dianne provides the rest. We cooked in most meals & she had ample cookware & a few spices. Bed was comfy & so was the furniture. Super clean & welcoming. I highly recommend! Great mother - daughter getaway. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
3397,53,So pleased you both had such a wonderful time and thank you for the great review. Seeing the dolphins is always special.
3398,53,Water Lover’s retreat is a 5 star stay! Every little extra detail was noticed and appreciated by my husband and I during our stay. We were able to sit on the porch for hours listening to the water through the steady breeze every night. We would gaze at the stars and gorgeous sky. The little cottage was perfect. Ron and D are awesome!
3399,53,"You are most welcome, so pleased you enjoyed."
3400,53,"Nice little house right on the ocean with easy access to the surrounding area. Dianne is easy to contact for anything needed. Overall a great experience, thanks for the wonderful week!"
3401,53,"We had a great time, lovely cottage in a great location.

Beautiful views, host went above and beyond.

Looking forward to staying again :-)"
3402,53,You are most welcome and thank you again for your kind words.
3403,53,"Such an amazing time! The cottage is adorable with a view you simply cannot get tired of! The simple amenities like homemade bread, toothbrushes, shampoo, etc was such a great touch! We used their kayaks and had so much fun on the lake. We’ll be back!"
3404,53,Thank you for the great review and so pleased you enjoyed. Hope to see you again.
3405,53,"The Waterlover’s Retreat is the perfect little getaway. Dianne and Ron are wonderful people and do an amazing job hosting. The cottage has everything you need for a relaxing and restful stay, as well as a great place to play (kayaking, fishing, checking out the local beaches). Our week-long stay was so much fun and we are already planning to come back."
3406,53,Thank you for the wonderful review. We have had guests comment on your sheepshead photos....they love them!
3407,53,"This cozy waterfront cottage has everything you might need for a relaxing stay! From the crisp bedsheets, fresh-baked bread, bowl of local strawberries (in season, of course), to the amazing view, it's the perfect location for a quick weekend escape or a more extended vacation. I've made several trips here and it's always a highlight of my year. Emerald Isle, Swansboro, and Beaufort are all within short drives for local excursions. If you prefer to stay put, there are kayaks to borrow, docks to fish from, and a hammock to nap in. Leaving is such sweet sorrow, but there's always the next visit to look forward to. Thank you, Dianne and Ron!"
3408,53,Wonderful to see you both again and very pleased you found out cottage a few years ago.
3409,53,"After just finishing my second stay at Dianne and Ron’s cottage, I am already looking forward to returning in August! As before, the cottage was immaculate; the location perfect; and the hosts couldn’t be more welcoming. With the great fishing and waterfront location, the cottage is truly a water lover’s retreat."
3410,53,So pleased you enjoyed and look forward to seeing you in August.
3411,53,"Dianne and Ron have a magical place, and I’m so thankful they’ve shared it on AirBnb. They nailed every detail that made the stay convenient. From bread, cheese, and butter, to toothbrushes and floss.

We went out with their amazing kayaks and saw dolphins and and an otter as well. It was an unforgettable trip."
3412,53,Thank you for the kind review...very special to be kayaking with the dolphins.
3413,53,Such a beautiful stay! definitely recommend choosing dianne & ron for your vacation. very gracious hosts. had all the small touches a home should have. look forward to returning sometime in the future.
3414,53,Thank you Ave. So pleased you enjoyed your visit.
3415,53,"Great private bungalow right on the water. Very welcoming, clean, private, quiet and very relaxing. Sitting outside overlooking the intercoastal waterway was one of the most enjoyable parts...lots of wildlife to watch including dolphins! Dianne and Ron are geat host."
3416,53,"Thank you Jim, so pleased you enjoyed."
3417,53,"Awesome place to stay! We didn’t want to leave. The cottage was so clean, comfortable & well equipped with everything we needed. The water view was stunning. The fresh loaf of artisan bread that Dianne put out to welcome us was delicious. We are hoping we get to return!"
3418,53,Thank you Beverly. Enjoyed meeting you and hope to see you in the future.
3419,53,"Dianne's ""Water Lover's Retreat"" is all that and more... We couldn't ask for a better place to unwind, relax, and refresh one's views of the rapidly changing and disruptive world we all share... we highly recommend this little slice of paradise for anyone needing to take a break from the ongoing demands of the dailiness of life..."
3420,53,Thank you Jim. Enjoyed meeting you and Vinny and pleased you were able to relax and rejuvenate.
3421,53,"My husband and I were celebrating his retirement and we're looking for the perfect place to stay. We definitely found it! The moment we pulled up Diane and Ron welcomed us and were such gracious hosts. They pointed us to great restaurants and the were there if we needed them but give you lots of privacy as well.

The moment you walk into the space you feel at ease. The first thing you notice is the amazing view of the water from everywhere in the cottage. You can wake up in the morning sit up in bed and are greeted by the view. You can be making dinner in the lovely kitchen and see the view or be sitting on the comfy sofa and look out across the water. Just magical!!!

Another guest in their review gave the pros and cons and said the only con was having to leave this amazing place. We agree...

If you are looking for somewhere to unwind and yet have an area full of things to do and see this is the place. We can't wait to come back again."
3422,53,"What an amazing experience it is to stay at Dianne's place! She has clearly thought of everything down to the smallest details (there were even band aids!). The view is incredible, the space well-stocked, clean and cozy and all of the surrounding water is amazingly accessible. Dianne was attentive and lovely to interact with and we had such a great time. We would absolutely come back!"
3423,53,So pleased you had such a great visit and thank you for the kind words.
3424,53,"Water, water, everywhere! Dianne & Ron have the perfect water lover’s retreat! The views are stunning from sunrise to sunset. Dianne had taken care of all the details that made the accommodations comfortable and easy! There was so much to enjoy on the property and in the surrounding waterfront areas, which were just miles away. We hope to return to this haven again and again!"
3425,53,So pleased the cottage felt like home and you enjoyed the goodies and your visit. The sunrises and sunsets are our favorite. We hope to see you again.
3426,53,"This was our third time staying at WLR and it is our happy place! We instantly relax when we walk in the door! Always extremely clean, very comfortable bed, linens, furniture. Fresh delicious bread and flowers greeted us as well as a few staples to get us started. We were there for my husbands birthday and Dianne even had two divine cupcakes from a local bakery. Very thoughtful touches.
Unfortunately we had to cut our trip short because of circumstances at home beyond our control. Dianne was very understanding and easy to deal with in our checkout process. She goes above and beyond! Hope to be back again soon!"
3427,53,We always enjoy hosting you and Ben and look forward to seeing you again soon.
3428,53,"Pros:
Very clean & comfortable. Amazing water views. Breathtaking sunrises and sunsets. Extremely well stocked. Over and above special touches that cannot help but to give you a glimpse of how much the hosts want to share their little piece of heaven.
Cons:
At some point you will need to leave.
Thank you Dianne and Ron for being the SUPER hosts that you are. Our stay was perfect and on the drive home were discussing how soon we may be able to return. We know that returning again and again is the best solution to the only con we found.
Thank you."
3429,53,"What a wonderful and kind review, thank you. We look forward to your return visit."
3430,53,"Stunning water view, beautiful cottage, super nice hosts, and very relaxing. Would come back any time."
3431,53,Thank you for your kind words and hope we will see you again.
3432,53,"Dianne and Ron are superb hosts. Super friendly, facilitating, but respectful of privacy. Upon arrival we found a sparkling clean cottage, nicely decorated and appointed with very comfortable furniture (including a bed with a wonderful mattress), and a thoughtfully chosen assortment of food and drink to tide us over until we could go shopping. The cottage is right next door to Dianne and Ron’s home, but we had our privacy, while being close enough for assistance when needed. We had a fine time pedal kayaking on the river, bicycling in Onslow County, and visiting the lovely aquarium on Emerald Isle. The only downside that we experienced during our fine stay was from all the military activity in the area. Lots of jet aircraft (none at super low altitude, thank goodness), and frequent explosions off in the distance from Marine training exercises at Camp Lejeune. Some actually rattled the cottage! (The Marines we’re quiet on our last day, so perhaps that is more the norm.) Even considering this, we had a restful, rejuvenating stay at the Water Lovers Retreat."
3433,53,"Thank you John for kind words about us and the cottage....so pleased you left feeling rested and rejuvenated. Yes the Marines were noisy. Thankfully, Camp Lejuene's training practices are infrequent. I apologize that you were disturbed."
3434,53,Come prepared to leave the cares of life behind and bask in the welcoming atmosphere Dianne has created--right on the water. You will lack for nothing. We were SO blessed here.
3435,53,"Best Airbnb experience we have ever had. Dianne and Ron were friendly and accommodating beyond expectations. The cottage is just perfect, clean, comfortable, unbelievable views and has everything needed for a fantastic stay. Directions were easy and all instructions great. We keep talking about how nice everything was. The furniture is super comfortable and the kitchen is equipped with everything needed to cook meals. The bathroom was nice beyond description and there was a washer and dryer available. Everything worked perfect. Best stay ever. Plan to return."
3436,53,Thank you so much....your review means a lot as you have stayed in many Airbnbs!!! We hope to see you again.
3437,53,Dianne’s cottage welcomes with a panoramic view of the waters of North Carolina. You can see sunrise and sunset! Great fishing on the deck or from a kayak. No amenities overlooked. If you want to leave the peaceful cove there are plenty of beaches to explore on the many barrier islands. Loved it all!
3438,53,"Thank you Nancy, so pleased you loved your visit."
3439,53,I had the pleasure of recently staying at Dianne and Ron’s Water Lover’s Retreat for over a month. Everything about the cottage and the location was absolutely wonderful. The cottage was very clean and fully equipped for my long stay. It has an unobstructed view and is located just 10 feet from the edge of the bay. The fishing was excellent from the host-provided kayaks or right from the attached deck. Our prize catch was a “monster” 28 inch long red drum caught from the cottage deck! Thank you Dianne and Ron. I look forward to returning as soon as possible.
3440,53,"So pleased you enjoyed your stay... we enjoyed meeting you, hosting your visit and look forward to seeing you soon."
3441,53,"This place is amazing! You can’t beat the view from the cottage windows and the amenities are above-and-beyond. Dianne communicated with us a few days ahead of time to give us all the details for check-in. When we arrived, the cottage was extremely clean and there was fresh baked bread, our first breakfast, snacks and treats for the week, and a few beverages in the refrigerator, along with fresh cut flowers on the table :) Ron was helpful in showing us how to set up the fishing gear and how to use the kayaks and crab traps. My husband and I spent the week fishing from the kayaks or from the deck every morning and evening. The cottage is very close to Emerald Isle beaches and many other various activities. But there is so much to do at the cottage from fishing and kayaking to relaxing in the hammock or enjoying a home cooked meal with a view that’s better than any waterfront restaurant. Thank you Ron and Dianne for sharing this beautiful place with others! We are looking forward to staying here again in the future."
3442,53,Thank you so much for the wonderful and detailed of the cottage and the area. We enjoyed meeting you both.
3443,53,"WLR was just amazing! Dianne and Ron are the best hosts. The cottage is the perfect spot to get away from the vacationing crowds, but still be close to everything to feel like a beach vacation. The hosts were so friendly and informative with ideas of where to go for dinners and willing to assist with fishing and crabbing if we wanted. I would highly recommend to anyone and we cannot wait to go back at some point to stay again!
Jody and Jim Mawhinney"
3444,53,So pleased you had such a great time. :-)
3445,53,"we love Diane's place! so many personal touches. fresh bread, all amenities you could need or want. beautiful views. loved kayaking right from the house. loved the area. we drove out to Beaufort, emerald isle, and downtown swansboro. we enjoyed our stay so much. cannot wait to return."
3446,53,Thank you Dan. So pleased you loved your visit. We feel the same about being able to step out of the house into a kayak. Look forward to seeing you both again.
3447,53,"Are you ready for breathtaking views, warm hospitality, peace, pin-drop silence, a place to regroup and take a break from wife. The cottage offers all of that and so much more. A hidden gem and out of all the Airbnb I have ever stayed it is ranked #1. The immaculate setting and lovely fresh baked bread were truly a bonus.

Thank you Dianne for making me feel quite special with all the added special touches you provided.

I will be back again!

Kind Regards,

Gee"
3448,53,Thank you for wonderful review and it is our pleasure to host you...please do return for another visit.
3449,53,"Second time staying here and have already booked next years trip! Dianne is thoughtful and attentive. Ron was kind in sharing bait and fishing tips with my husband. They were available yet respectful of our space. Rental is better than described! Location is perfect, extremely relaxing and gorgeous. Loved sitting on the front deck each day. As far as inside, Dianne has equipped the cottage with everything you need and even things you didn’t know you needed! Bed linens were high quality, place was spotless when we arrived. Fresh homemade bread and cocktail/breakfast items were all ready when we got there. We have stayed at many many Airbnb’s and vrbos through the years, and this is by far, at the top of the list!"
3450,53,Thank you for your excellent review and appreciate all the positive feedback....see you next year.
3451,53,This was our second year at this lovely property. Dianne and Ron are the perfect host and hostess. They provide every last detail for a spectacular vacation. The cottage is very well appointed and you will want for nothing. Time spent there will make beautiful memories for years to come.
3452,53,"Thank you for your kind words and love your comment about ""beautiful memories""!"
3453,53,"Just completed our second stay at WLR and had another fabulous week on the water. The house was very clean, well appointed and had plenty of 'goodies' left for us to enjoy. The water views from inside and out are spectacular and you truly feel like your staying on top of the water. I was also lucky enough to land a nice 25"" long Red Drum which we had for dinner that same day. We will be back next year for sure."
3454,53,Thank you John for the lovely review and appreciate how much you and Rebecca enjoy your visits. Look forward to seeing you in 2022
3455,53,"I've stayed at this wonderful cottage multiple times, and every time, it's so hard to leave! Pure relaxation in a comfortable, peaceful retreat that comes well-stocked with everything you might need, but forgot to pack. Location and atmosphere keep me coming back!"
3456,53,Thank you for the lovely review and believe you and Katya have the record for the most visits! which we really appreciate. Look forward to seeing you again soon.
3457,53,The cottage was wonderful! The view was spectacular when waking up every morning or sitting out on the deck at sunrise. Dianne offered a helpful guide book that showed places to eat or visit while we stayed and made the trip one to remember. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone!
3458,53,"I have nothing but good things to say about our 10 day stay at Water Lover’s Retreat. Having had extensive experience as AirB&B guests, we would rate this experience at the top. The cottage is plenty spacious and features a panoramic view of the White Oak River estuary. The porch overlooks the bay and invites hours of sitting and listening to the waves below, if that is your choice.

Nearby Swansboro is a nice town full of restaurants and shops, all described in Diane’s meticulous Resources Book. Three kayaks are available on the property for as much paddling around the bay as you care to do. If you like to fish, we watched our host pull flounder and other fish right off the dock on a daily basis. Also plenty of hiking around the area.

The cottage is extremely well organized and the amenities are high quality. Diane and Ron are perfect hosts and clearly take pride in providing a great experience. They are also nice people.

We would recommend this property as an excellent value and an experience we will remember fondly.

Sean"
3459,53,"Thank you for your kind words about the cottage, location and us :-)."
3460,53,"We couldn’t have asked for more. A quiet location, close to amenities and a view to beat all views. I worked the week from the dining table and it was the best of work weeks. My husband spent the week exploring. The weather changed through out the day....rain, wind, sun, and fog. The wildlife is abundant both fish, foul and dolphin! The thoughtful touches and fresh bread made it extra special."
3461,53,"Thank you for the great review....I love the ""best of work weeks"" comment. So pleased the bread was a success!"
3462,53,"Cannot say enough about this charming Retreat like get away cottage. We happen to have some rainy days but loved the wall-to-wall views of the water from inside the house. Lots of birds and other wildlife such as dolphins and river otters are so heartwarming to see. This lovely cottage has absolutely everything top-notch that you could ever want. We did a lot of cooking and enjoyed how thoughtfully the kitchen was laid out and equipped.
The hosts were above and beyond helpful and accommodating. The homemade bread and other goodies tasted 100% gourmet! Feeling so relaxed and grateful and excited about when we will get to go back again. Thank you thank you Dianne and Ron!"
3463,53,"So pleased you enjoyed the cottage, and thank you for the great review/feedback. Fingers crossed for sunshine during your next visit."
3464,53,"My wife raved about this place from the moment they alerted me they arrived. They were able to kayak and apparently, my son became a hammock aficionado while there. All my wife has told me is how much she is looking forward to going back and that next time I have to go because it's just perfect, she said it's small but was perfectly sized. My son took the upper area so he could do school and have a little privacy. I am really looking forward to rebooking after hearing them talk about how much they were able to just relax."
3465,53,Thank you for the lovely comments! We enjoyed meeting Christine and Grayson and look forward to meeting you too.
3466,53,"Water Lover’s Retreat is a perfect getaway - gorgeous views of the water, every comfort of home, and a secluded feel but still close to necessities. We particularly loved having access to the big green egg for seafood grill suppers. The kayaks were a huge perk as well - we could run down to the pier for a quick sunset paddle or take them out all day for an epic adventure. Dianne and Ron were lovely hosts and gave great advice about where to go and what to do. And I’m very cautious about pandemic safety, but when Dianne explained their airing-out and cleaning protocols, I didn’t have a minute’s worry. I can’t think of one thing I’d change!"
3467,53,Thank you so much for the lovely review and feedback on protocols. So pleased you enjoyed your adventures and visit.
3468,53,"Absolutely amazing! From the hosts, views, and home...you won’t be disappointed!"
3469,54,Amazing! Beautiful space and amazing communication from Carleigh. We had an amazing time and will definitely be going back to Happy the Bus in the future! Super clean and a welcoming space. 10/10!!!
3470,54,"Magical little spot! Even better than the photos and so many thoughtful touches. Nice snacks, natural soap products, cozy bed and there was even a diffuser on when we arrived with nice essential oils <3 The hosts are lovely and we wish we had more days to stay here. Highly recommend!"
3471,54,"We absolutely adored staying here. It was clean and cozy and waking up to the sound of rain was wonderful. I wish we could have stayed longer then one night, but it was magical to say the least."
3472,54,"Happy is the perfect little getaway. It is a wonderful experience being hosted by Carleigh. We wouldn't change a change. When you leave, you'll feel rejuvenated and ready to conquer the world. There are so many amenities on the property, you will be comfortable and then some. Highly recommended!"
3473,54,"""Happy"" was a really fun getaway and had the perfect touches to make it an experience. We appreciated all the details inside and outside of the bus. Comfortable, clean and well decorated."
3474,54,Such a wonderful stay. I enjoyed Happy so much and would love to come back one day soon!
3475,54,"Traveling to Duke for doctor appointments we wanted a bit of fun in the stay. The bus, a sight to behold in the woods, did not disappoint, though the hammock got me first. Details of furnishings—from library to lighting, floor to ceiling, sofa to bed—were comfortable and well done. And then ice cream snacks in the freezer! Carleigh welcomed us well. Just what this doctor-weary person needed."
3476,54,Great vibe. Very relaxing.
3477,54,"11/10 would recommend. Happy is the best place to take a break from reality. The hospitality from the owners was amazing. Happy the Bus is stocked with games, snacks, a beautiful atmosphere, and the comfiest shed ever if I might add. The price is unbeatable and I highly recommend. It was the best stay ever! :)"
3478,54,This was a very beautiful stay. The pictures do not do it justice. The hosts were very kind as well. Everything was perfect.
3479,54,"This place is magical!! Such a great value and a perfect getaway! Felt like we were hidden away in nature but still close to so much to do! Carleigh was an absolute wonderful host and I can't wait to go back and visit again! Highly recommend staying in this cozy, adorable bus! Happy will you happy for sure!"
3480,54,Wonderful experience. Perfect little getaway for couples and great communication from the owners. Left some gifts for us when we arrived and gave great suggestions for things to do and places to eat around town.
3481,54,"We were very overwhelmed and would love to come back more often if we lived nearby. It really is a special and extraordinary experience! With so much attention to detail, the bus was expanded and the entire property was laid out. I am at a loss for words!"
3482,54,"Details are the reason we love the places we go, but no place has given me such an appreciation for the small details like this place. “Happy”-so perfectly named… describes the feeling that my son and I so joyfully captured. It’s not just the adorable name of this bus -turned -tiny home….experience, it describes the emotions surging through your spirit as you take in the sweet meaningful details.
-A beautiful healthy fern hanging at the door.
-A well loved guitar hanging in the window.
-a diffuser with lavender— filling the atmosphere.
-a selection of juicy reads above the driver’s seat.
-draped lighting that set such a mood.
- frosty cool AC on a hot day.
-coffee mugs hanging above the sink.
-A French press for the sassy girl in me that wants to be boujiee!
-a medicine cabinet filled with all the little things you’ve probably packed because you didn’t think they’d provide it!
-a bed so soft you’ll need some nuzzling time within those white sheets!
-fresh brown eggs strait from The chicken’s booty ( as Sweet Carleigh put it so eloquently)
-frozen sweet snacks that delighted my 14 year old in between his lazy swings on the hammock.
Frying pans that make any meal taste good because of the quality.
I could go on, but you should experience the same element of surprise that we did. You’re gonna love it! You’re gonna wanna book it again. You’re gonna wish you had the perfect company so make sure you bring that person who’ll bask in the nature right along with you. Although I brought a kid- this is the best get away for two besties, two lovers… especially two lovers… and an even better place for you. Just you alone. Carleigh- thank you for having a vision for a true place of safety, respite, peace and tranquility. Thank you for keeping a price that allows families to afford something so magical if they would only step into nature’s heartbeat!
-"
3483,54,Highly recommend! Such an amazing and quiet get away for me and the wife and so much is included that’s not even listed in description
3484,54,"Such a great experience with Happy. It was our last night of our cross country road trip and Happy was such a memorable space. Carleigh's energy is amazing, and everything was laid out for me and my partner. The ambiance is calming and gives you a feel of camping without tents. Love love love."
3485,54,"Ahh yall were wonderful humans! Stoked for all the adventures ahead for you two.. I've got a hunch yall will get into some fun!

Haha oh my gosh the sad thing is we do have a shower matt.. it's just tucked right under the bed for you .. haha I just forgot to show you.. classic.

3486,54,"Beautiful, magical space. Carleigh is so kind, loving, and considerate. A must stay! You will be surrounded by so much beauty & joy. ❤️ The bus is beautiful and they have so many little treats in the fridge and pantries. The kitchen is lovely to cook in. The whole experience is a 10/10."
3487,54,"Carleigh and Tina are super nice, warm and welcoming people. If you‘re new to the area and not sure what to do, they‘ve got more than enough recommendations for you! And will also be very responsive should you need anything.
The bus Happy is amazing! You‘ll basically have a whole appartment to yourself, with all the comfort an appartment should come with. Only that its in the woods in a bus with a terrace on the roof. Would have loved to stay longer, would most definitely revisit!"
3488,54,"Exceptional attention to detail. Clean, comfortable, relaxing, so much value to be had here. Wonderful and well worth it. This is a must see if you are an Airbnb regular- must see! And if new, please come be spoiled here!"
3489,54,"Staying at Happy the Bus was truly an amazing experience! The hospitality that Catina offer their guests is unmatched. From a stocked pantry, to a cozy bed, to bringing us games and more. It’s hard to believe that we were only your second guests. We will definitely be back again."
3490,54,"Everything was ACTUALLY perfect. We stopped thinking it would be nice but it exceeded our expectations for sure. The couple hosting was super chill and nice and gave a great list of places to try in the area. I can't keep going because I don't have anything bad to say about my experience there. The next day I was yelling ""I STAYED ON THE CUTEST BUS OF MY LIFE LAST NIGHT AND I NEED TO GO BACK"" to anyone who would listen to me. Also, Smokey Joe is SUCH a nice hang out spot."
3491,55,Another good stay!
3492,55,Great stay yet again! Can’t wait to return.
3493,55,We had a fabulous stay at Mikes charming cottage by the sea.
3494,55,Mikes place is an absolute gem! While it seems small from the outside he’s perfected the layout and it’s very spacious! We cooked a few meals the kitchen is very great and usable. Literally steps from the beach and while we didn’t use the firepower it is very well maintained! Definitely would rent again
3495,55,"My stay was exactly what I needed. Peaceful, right in the water and the fenced yard for my dogs was perfect so they could go on vacation with me. I’ll definitely be back! Thanks so much"
3496,55,Sandpiper was the perfect peaceful getaway for a night! Right on the beach and had the best beach cottage vibe. Beach chairs and towels provided made it easy to just show up and enjoy. The front porch with the rockers were my favorite! We loved it.
3497,55,"Adorable place and amazing location! We loved our stay and look forward to coming back. It is a perfect peaceful getaway with every amenity you could need.
A word of warning, the bed is very high off the floor. The host has provided a step stool, so you can get in and out of bed even if you are a shorty like me. If you have poor balance or are up a lot in the night this might not be your best match."
3498,55,"great little place. right on the beach, club de to restaurants. recommended."
3499,55,Great place! enjoyed staying right on the beach with my dogs. Very cozy and relaxing. The only negative is that the gate needs some WD 40 on the latch and if you have a small dog they will find the gate easy to slip under. Mine did! All in all great get away!
3500,55,This is a great little place to stay. Very understated outside and carefully updated inside. An amazing kitchen. Spotlessly clean and right on the ocean. We loved it!
3501,55,"Adorable place!
Very clean and peaceful
Would definitely plan several more stays!"
3502,55,"Wonderful stay, cozy cottage, beautiful location!"
3503,55,"Always so peaceful to stay here.
This time I invited friends and made a long weekend that was just perfect. From the cozy porch and yard, well stocked kitchen to make homemade meals, fenced yard for the pups and being just steps from the beach it is just a special place. Already looking forward to next time! Thanks, Mike!"
3504,55,"nice little beachfront cottage. enjoyed sitting on the porch looking out over the ocean. easy beach access and plenty of wide open beach. we had a great visit, thx"
3505,55,"Was really pleased with the property. Went for a weekend getaway to celebrate a relatives birthday and loved it! Very clean, easy to access, and plenty of privacy."
3506,55,"Our stay at the Sandpiper cottage was a gift from our children. It was a wonderful 3 nights. The cottage is bright, cute and just the right size for two people. We loved the back porch that looked over the wild oats to the ocean. The kitchen was well supplied. Though we didn’t bring our dog, the fenced backyard would have been a great place for him to hang out. The owners were very responsive when we had questions before our arrival. I would give this cottage 5 stars and hope to stay there again."
3507,55,"Sandpiper is a great, affordable stay at the beach. The duplex is perfect for our needs - huge bonus that it's pet friendly! Very enjoyable stay."
3508,55,"This is a very special place. The view is amazing. You can grab a cup of coffee and a book, relax in a rocking chair and watch the sunrise over the water from the porch. The space was smaller than what we are used to, but they made such great use of every inch of it! We truly enjoyed our stay here. We had everything we needed kitchen and entertainment wise. We loved the fenced in yard for the pup and the fire pit in the front. The heated bathroom floors were a nice touch and we appreciated all of the little details they added here and there that made the cottage so cozy and welcoming."
3509,55,"Perfect place, perfect location, perfect view!! It had everything I needed and then some!"
3510,55,Great stay. Would absolutely visit again.
3511,55,"We had the most amazing time at The Sandpiper. Perfect location, super clean and all the amenities you could possibly need. The fenced in yard was a huge bonus for my four legged friends. There is no better view from which to drink coffee and enjoy the ocean. And the fire pit was awesome too!"
3512,55,"Location, location, location! Sit on the porch and watch the sunrise and the waves roll in! A few steps and your on the beach! Easy access right outside the property gate. Fence was so convenient for our pup. Fire pit ready for wood. Well stocked kitchen! Comfy bed! Mike is very responsive and noted he was readily available if we needed anything! Great second stay and we’ll be back!"
3513,55,Perfect place for 1 or 2 people and especially great for our dogs. No stairs to deal with and the little fenced in yard is awesome to have. Hope to return some day.
3514,55,"This is our second visit , now we’ve stayed on both sides. Can’t wait to return, so perfect for our dear old dog who can’t do steps….but beware of the sand spurs as your pup goes in the backyard. The porch with blankets and more coffee was heavenly! A hawk flew right in front of us this morning and landed next door.!"
3515,55,"This is one of my favorite places to visit. It is ideally located, dog friendly, and every little convenience is already there for you."
3516,55,We love Sandpiper so much! We want to move in permanently. It’s the perfect gem to come and relax and enjoy the close proximity to the beach. The kitchen has all that you need to cook all your meals. Mike is a great host and very responsive. We can’t wait to come back!!
3517,55,"Great Place, as pictured and described. Would recommend!"
3518,55,This place is wonderful and exactly as advertised. It was stocked with everything we could have possibly needed. Would highly recommend!
3519,55,"Such a cute gem of a place right on the beach. The views are incredible and being footsteps from the ocean is all that you need. I appreciated that Mike allows dogs as I needed to bring my pet along. We appreciated the fenced in yard and the front porch! Also, the kitchen has all you need to make meals or if you don’t feel like cooking, there are numerous restaurants close by. I will definitely be booking again!"
3520,55,"It was perfect for a couple's getaway. Loved how it had a little fenced in area for pets. Oceanfront view was really nice, didn't get to use the firepit because it was a little windy. Everything was clean and communication was excellent."
3521,55,PERFECT!!!
3522,56,wonderful worth it
3523,56,"Although it rained the entire time, we enjoyed the rain in the metal roof and the peaceful environment. Can’t wait to stay when it is dry."
3524,56,Great time in a beautiful spot.
3525,56,"Super cool treehouse! Loved the fire pit and all of the activities out in the woods. Remarkably clean and well kept, especially considering it’s a treehouse. Thanks so much!"
3526,56,Great place for a night get away. Enjoyed it!
3527,56,We had a great time! Perfect for a one night getaway. Lots to do in the area and close to everything. Enjoyed the jump pad as well. The woods stand and s’mores from the children was awesome! Thanks for a great place to stay
3528,56,The tree house was exactly as described. The property was unique and relaxing. It was a great getaway and experience.
3529,56,Excellent choice for different overnight experience. Nice wooded location. Clean and orderly. Accommodation were very adequate. Fire pits provided were great accommodation to allow family time. Highly recommended!
3530,56,We loved our stay so much. It was dark when we got there and the lights were so beautiful in the forest. It was surrounded my the sounds of peepers and it was raining which was lovely on the metal roof. In the morning getting a glimpse of the paths and trees and the birds chirping was so peaceful. We would love the chance to go back and stay again.
3531,56,Very well done treehouse. Very relaxing and comfortable place to stay.
3532,56,"Sweet Ashley was the perfect place to end our Spring Break week. The treehouse is accessible, clean, and well maintained. The location on the farm was great. You could easily see the bounce pad, easily access the trail and the wood shack. We loved this property and hope to come back again for a get away soon!"
3533,56,"It was my Birthday weekend just my husband and I. It was fun we loved 🥰 the area, not far from concord mills, or Charlotte it was nice to be away off the grid. Would love to come back to try a different treehouse."
3534,56,Took my daughter and a couple friends for her birthday. Sleeping was very comfortable! It was a nice get away. Felt like we were far from home even though we were only 30 minutes from away!
3535,56,This is our second time staying and we love it each time!
3536,56,"Great stay in Sweet Ashley! We will be back soon! Thanks, Trent!"
3537,56,We had a great time staying in our treehouse. Reminded us of our cabin in the Colorado mountains.
3538,56,This is now 2 visits to Trents treehouses. Great place will go back again
3539,56,This place was perfect.
3540,56,"We had the best time at the ""treesort."" It was really calm and peaceful. Trent was very communicative and helpful. We loved it and will definitely be back!"
3541,56,We enjoyed the treehouse and grounds and would love to return in the future. Beds were comfy and we loved the swings and hammock. We are excited to recommend the Treesort to friends!
3542,56,Absolutely perfect! Loved the balcony off the top part of the treehouse. Could here the creek flowing. So peaceful. Boys loved the jump pillow.
3543,56,As always a great little retreat for my wife and I’s birthdays! This is our second time and the second tree house we’ve been to. Def coming back to stay at the hobbit house!
3544,56,Loved the treehouse will definitely be going back also won’t to stay in the hobbit houses overall loved the whole experience.Loved how the children had firewood and s’mores to buy
3545,56,We enjoyed our stay and especially listening to the rain on the tin roof. It was relaxing and peaceful.
3546,56,We had a wonderful time. A one night getaway and it was peaceful. Only thing I can say is I wish the tv service was better but everything else was wonderful. Thank you so much! We definitely will come back and stay in a bigger one!
3547,56,Such a cool place and so much fun to stay here!
3548,56,This is our second time visiting Cherry Treesort. Our boys love it and we are planning our next trip. It’s so peaceful and relaxing.
3549,56,Enjoyed our stay and will return!
3550,56,Very cool experience ! I feel like it was pretty cold even with the heat on just because maybe the structure of the place but it was an awesome experience and Trent communicated very quickly and seemed like a very nice guy! Wil def be back if we ever come that way.
3551,56,"I booked this place to have some solitude and peace during the Christmas season. It’s the perfect quiet little cabin. Everything works fine, the air smells great outside, very tranquil and peaceful. I liked to sit in the loft and read with the windows open. Enough space to have a couple people join if I wanted but not so large as to be uncomfortable when by myself. Really just a gorgeous little place."
3552,56,Such a great place! We had a wonderful stay. It was the coldest weekend in decades but we were very cozy warm inside the Tree House :)
3553,56,"Beautiful treehouse in an out of the way area. No loud city sounds! Convenient to the North Carolina Transportation Museum which is why we stayed there. Kiddo loved the loft area and the whole place was very neat, and clean."
3554,56,"Loved, loved, lol vef this place! My kids already want to come back!!"
3555,56,"This whole place is a vibe! Our family of 5 unplugged from the world and just enjoyed each others company. It rained the night we arrived, so things were wet the next day, but it didn’t even matter - the kids were able to be kids and use their imaginations as we made our way around the property. Without a doubt we will stay here again and again. The unit was clean, all linens provided, and just super peaceful overall. Let filling recharged."
3556,56,We enjoyed our stay at the Sweet Ashley. It was so cozy and just right for our family of four. Our kids loved it too!
3557,56,So much fun!!! Our stay was just perfect for a weekend getaway after the Polar Express ride. The treehouse was clean and had everything we needed as described. Our grandson loved the jumping pad as well as cooking dinner on a fire and of course s’mores. We will definitely be back to try out another treehouse!
3558,56,"We had a fantastic stay! We made a one night stop here on our way to visit family!
If I knew we would love it so much, I would have scheduled to stop for two nights so we had more time to enjoy the grounds! It was the perfect camping experience for those of us who like appreciate the comforts of home!"
3559,56,Great weekend away
3560,56,We had a great stay!
3561,56,We had a great stay and our kids absolutely loved the tree house.
3562,56,"We loved our stay and getaway in the treehouse! Our son loved staying upstairs in the loft. Everything was clean. The bed was comfy. We have no complaints.
It was nice to walk around the property, walking over bridges and admiring the other tree houses. The swings were fun. Making a fire in the pit was a breeze. We will return!"
3563,56,"Clean, charming, one of a kind experience! We will definitely be back."
3564,56,"Wonderful stay, thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Very clean and comfortable"
3565,56,"Our family of 4 had a good stay at Sweet Ashley. The unit was spacious enough for us, and the kitchenette was serviceable for what we needed. We enjoyed the turret/loft area and slept well on the main bed. The sofa bed was fairly uncomfortable, and parts of it were broken, allowing the mattress to cave in on one end—needless to say, it didn't make for a good night of sleep. Next time we stay at Cherry Treesort, we'll look for a unit with enough real beds to accommodate everyone. The area is very rural and quiet. Despite having other treehouses (and hobbit houses!) nearby, neighbor noise was not an issue at all. The jump pillow was a lot of fun for the kids. Thanks!"
3566,56,We had a great time!
3567,56,Very cool place!
3568,56,Will definitely come back!
3569,56,We had an amazing time as a family! On the way home we already started planning our next visit. Thanks for an unforgettable experience!
3570,56,Great time at the treehouse! Will definitely be back soon! Clean and comfy and cozy!
3571,56,"Sweet Ashley was the perfect ""camping"" getaway for our family of five for three nights in the middle of the week! With only ten ""sites"" on the property, we often felt like we had the whole place to ourselves. Other times, it was nice to socialize with other guests in passing. The bounce pillow was a huge plus and we liked that it was in line-of-sight of our front door and firepit; We felt comfortable with our children walking over to jump and we could watch them without having to leave our little treehouse area. It was a short walk back and forth if they needed anything back at the treehouse. Our kids played ""Mother May I"" and ""Fishy, Fishy Cross My Ocean"" with kids from other groups on the bounce pillow. One evening, around 10 kids were playing together at the bounce pillow and even knew each others' names. It was really sweet. Seemed like most people we talked to lived within an hour or so from China Grove; We drove 2-2.5 hours from Asheville. We went to Lazy 5 Ranch and Dan Nicholas Park, both of which we highly recommend. (Eat at Lakeview Restaurant if you go to Dan Nicholas!) Also ate at Brian's Grill for breakfast the first morning and loved the small-town experience. (The kids liked having Cheerwine in a bottle!) I liked that you could walk into our treehouse at ground level! Convenient parking right across from our front entrance to make loading easier and storing things in the van that we didn't need to take up space inside the treehouse. So many thoughtful details: the hammock strung between two trees near the firepit, two comfy hammock chairs underneath the house, chairs around the firepit, broom and dust pan to keep things tidy. Planning and packing for this little trip was super easy. The kids loved the little room upstairs and I liked that all their stuff was tucked away, out of sight/ out of mind from the main living space. We brought our griddle and crock pot and had lots of easy, yummy meals sitting on the front porch. The 25 acres is laid out so well with lots of space between campsites; way more privacy than a mainstream campground. We loved our Cherry Treesort experience and would love to go back with our extended family next fall. It's a great place for a large group to rent multiple dwellings and spread out. Lots of field space to play frisbee or football or soccer. Super fun; Can't go wrong with any of the offerings at Cherry Treesort!"
3572,56,"Fantastic experience all the way around, we’ll definitely stay again!"
3573,56,"A fun night in the woods, while convenient to town. Our kids had a blast on the swings under their tree house and climbing up to the loft/balcony. The jump pillow was also a hit, along with all the trails to explore. We ended the night roasting marshmallows, and the kids fell asleep as soon as their heads hit the pillow. Our birthday boy (3) was ecstatic to see tractors “sleeping near him”!"
3574,56,Very nicely tucked away and gives you that much needed getaway without really getting away would definitely recommend
3575,56,Wonderful stay!
3576,56,Great experience!
3577,56,My 10 year-old son and I had a great time! We made hot dogs and s’mores around the fire pit and played games in the treehouse. It was a perfect mother-son getaway.
3578,56,This is our second annual stay and we have enjoyed ourselves immensely both times. The upgrades to the property are noticeable and appreciated. We will be back to try a different treehouse next year!
3579,56,My 3 boys had an experience of a lifetime and we can’t wait to come back!
3580,56,Loved our stay here. We are looking forward to our next stay soon.
3581,56,Always a great time at the Treesort!
3582,56,Perfect getaway.
3583,56,We really enjoyed our stay. The area is lovely and very peaceful.
3584,56,My daughter really enjoyed having her birthday party at the Tree House!
3585,56,"Everything was such a pleasure!!! Such a unique experience, Glamping in a Tree House. We have already booked to come back with our kids and our 10 year anniversary!!! Would rent them every weekend if we could."
3586,56,"This place was perfect!!! we absolutely loved the observation tower inside the tree house. We watched fireflies an enjoyed the 360 views. we did have to leave early because of a family emergency, but we are already trying to plan our next trip back."
3587,56,Always a great time staying at The Cherry Treesort. Have stayed 5 times and are never disappointed.
3588,56,Sweet Ashley cabin was adorable and cozy. The farm is beautiful and accommodating. I look forward to returning!
3589,56,This is a unique weekend getaway with the family. The kids can’t wait to go back and stay in another tree house
3590,56,Our family really enjoyed our visit to Cherry Treesort. It's a delightful and different getaway that we think everyone will enjoy.
3591,56,"It was a really great stay, I can't say I have anything negative to say about the stay. I fully recommend to anyone considering it, to stay here."
3592,56,What a unique experience ! Can cross this off the bucket list !
3593,56,So neat to sleep in a real treehouse! Very clean and a great experience!
3594,56,I just did.
3595,56,"Highly recommend this stay! The price was on the lower end for the area, but the quality was amazing. Beautiful area and fun to explore or be part of nature."
3596,56,"Great spot close to town but with a secluded feel. We stayed in the Sweet Ashley and our teen appreciated her private loft area with balcony. Cute place, we'll definitely stay again if we're ever in the area. We had dinner at the China Grove Family House and it was delicious."
3597,56,Perfect for our family of 6! LOVED the location and being so close to everything! A must stay in Helen!
3598,56,"Our family of four stopped here for a night as part of a larger trip. The treehouse was so cute and charming! We loved walking around the trails to see the other houses, and our kids loved the chair swings and hammock."
3599,56,"The Cherry Treesort was a fantastic and initia unique place to stay. Our family spent 2 nights on the property and our kids enjoyed the space to run around, a well as the swings, hammock, and nightly fire pits. It is the perfect place to relax and disconnect. Trent went above and beyond for us and we would highly recommend staying at the Cherry Treesort."
3600,56,Great family get away! Super cool set up! We will definitely be back!
3601,56,AMAZING! Would love to come back!
3602,56,Staying at the Sweet Ashley was sweet! Beautiful place inside and out.
3603,56,As awesome as advertised. can't wait to return.
3604,56,"I really enjoyed my visit to Trent's Treehouse in North Carolina, to the point where when it was time to check out, I really had a hard time leaving. Everything about my visit was smooth, cozy, and convenient, even in this incredible NC heat. And if possible, I will try to get friends to visit with me again since there are other treehouses on the property."
3605,56,Very peaceful and relaxing place. Our cabin was comfortable and clean. The beds were very comfortable. We highly recommend anyone who wants a quiet getaway to head for Cherry Treesort in Rowan County.
3606,56,Absolutely wonderful experience! We stayed a night while traveling through the area and now want to come back for a longer stay! Our kids loved every aspect of the treehouse as well as the hammock and fire pit! It was a perfect place for our family of 4!
3607,56,This was such a fun weekend getaway. We can’t wait to come back!
3608,56,"Wonderful experience, kids had a blast!"
3609,56,Amazing getaway!
3610,56,"We surprised our 3 boys (ages 10,8, and 6) and booked a stay at one of Trent’s treehouse, the Sweet Ashley. The boys were in awe and ecstatic when they first saw where we’d be spending the night. We all loved the unique and fun experience we had staying there!! We were able to cook hotdogs over the fire pit, make s’mores, and just enjoy the surrounding and peaceful night! Our boys loved swinging in the hanging chairs, laying on the hammock, and playing the jumbo jenga in front of the treehouse! In the morning, we woke up and took a walk to check out the trail! Trent was an excellent host and it was easy to communicate with him! It was fun and perfect all around and we will be doing this experience again in the future when we travel to the south again! Thank you Trent and family!
Erika and Jeff Rowohlt and boys"
3611,56,"If you are looking for a memorable experience with your loved ones, or just a solo trip for some R&R, this is the place to go! I loved staying at the “Sweet Ashley” treesort. Clean, and equipped with everything we needed. My kids loved the room upstairs, and the swings. We really enjoyed cooking out at the fire pit, and the peace and quiet. I am already looking for to our next trip!"
3612,56,Sweet Ashley was a wonderful little place to stay for a couple nights! Our family of 5 loved it and had plenty of space! Would highly recommend!
3613,56,"STAY IN THE COLDER MONTHS,"
3614,56,What a cute treehouse! & loved walking around the property. We had a great time. The place was so cute & the perfect getaway. We’re on a long road trip & this was one of our favorite spots.
3615,56,Thanks
3616,56,Great place to spend a few days with family.
3617,56,We loved the treesort! It was adorable and such a fun little vacation. We will definitely be back.
3618,56,"Sweet Ashley was the best 2 hour getaway for our family. My sister and her family stayed a couple of houses down and it was so nice to have them with us, but able to sleep in our own area. The top floor was magical and fun to see out 360 degrees. The only complaint up there was on these super hot summer days, there isn't AC or coolness from downstairs, so we weren't able to take advantage of the extra bed up there. We did enjoy the balcony very much for reading and coffee this morning! The fire pit area has plenty of room for everyone and we were able to roast hotdogs and s'mores. Walking through the paths in the woods were my kids favorites, and I personally enjoyed swinging on the hammock. The bed downstairs that we all slept on was surprisingly comfortable and the couch was as well.
We can't wait to return for another visit to try out the other houses!"
3619,56,This place was amazing! Was slightly less private than i expected but was still wonderful. The outdoor space was really relaxing and all the trails were fun to walk around on. Definitely staying on my list for when wed like to return to NC.
3620,56,"Fun experience, quiet, peaceful, and relaxing. Treehouses are very clean, comfy, and cozy. We definitely stay here again!"
3621,56,Absolutely loved our stay. This cozy treehouse was a perfect girls getaway
3622,56,"We loved our stay in the Sweet Ashley! It is a beautiful little treehouse but still had all the modern amenities you could want. We had a peaceful evening enjoying all the sitting spots, from the upper patio to the hammock. It was a perfect last stop for our vacation."
3623,56,Great place all around! So cute. The only thing I wish was they specified there were two entrances because we were confused when we got in and it was dark. Overall it was beautiful!
3624,56,"Beautiful accommodation, true to the pictures. It was clean and the host is a great communicator. So peaceful and a great place to stay, only wish we had longer to stay!"
3625,56,"Great stay in a cute, quaint place among the trees! Enjoyed everything about our stay! Will definitely go back!"
3626,56,"I surprised my husband with a solo trip for his birthday, and he absolutely LOVED his time at the cabin! He had everything he needed, the AC worked AMAZING, and the property was gorgeous. We will definitely be booking again! Thanks again Trent!"
3627,58,Very quick to respond when we contacted them. Very friendly.
3628,58,"10/10 would recommend!! Book this place for beautiful views and an amazing cabin to spend a few nights in. Michael was a very hospitable host, and I cannot wait to return for another stay!"
3629,58,"Thank you so much, Elizabeth, for your kind words."
3630,58,"Super welcoming and attentive hosts, and the tiny home and location is perfect! Had a great time and would definitely recommend to others."
3631,58,"Thank you so much, Jessie, for taking the time to leave such a nice review."
3632,58,"As always, awesome host. the only kicker was I'm pretty sure the best was listed as larger than it actually was. It was an adventure for sure! the stairs are a challenge for sure, so if you're out of shape or have any aiglments, then definitely choose to stay in the other tiny house they host. The view was awesome amazing and it's such a nice little hideaway."
3633,58,"Thank you, Stephanie, for choosing to stay with us again in the high country! Little Red has a queen sized bed. It does feel smaller since it is positioned on the floor of the loft. We will check to make sure the listing is correct. Thank you so much for letting us know."
3634,58,"Michael was quick to respond, super helpful, and friendly! The tiny house was so cute and and secluded- great place to relax and have some peace and quite."
3635,58,"Fantastic house! the host, Michael, was even willing to come by and help us get the fire started! Such a Great time"
3636,58,"Michael and Samantha’s place was very peaceful and exactly what we wanted for some time to unwind. They were very responsive and the surroundings, while off the beaten path for sure, were beautiful. As long as you don’t mind a drive to town, this place is perfect. We recommend star gazing!"
3637,58,Thank you Lucy!
3638,58,"Had a great time, wonderful place. Hosts were very friendly and communicative. Very easy to check in and check out with clear instructions and expectations."

3640,58,Beautiful place and super unique! We loved it and it was so peaceful out there❤️ Micheal and Samantha were also super quick to respond and very clear with all of the instructions! Would definitely stay again!
3641,58,Thank you Daniela!
3642,58,"Wonderful time staying at this Airbnb! The home is very cute and comfortable. The space is great for a weekend getaway! The area is quiet and peaceful. Felt safe, cozy and at home! Would definitely come back to stay!!"
3643,58,Thank you Crystal!
3644,58,I loved Tiny Red! Beautiful view. Will come again.
3645,58,"Michael and Samantha are great people, who love what they are doing!

Place is beautiful and clean, it was perfect for our small runaway from the world!y husband and I enjoyed it so much :)


You should definitely check it out during summer or fall, the views will be breathtaking!"
3646,58,"I was looking for silence, solitude, and simplicity. All three were found at this stay. I couldn’t have been happier with my experience. I’ll be back."
3647,58,"We absolutely loved Little Red Tiny! It was perfect for a getaway weekend in the Mountains—Ohh and the view was breathtaking!
We literally felt like kids again, as we enjoyed the loft experience for sleeping and watching tv. We were so giddy each time we came back, like, “We’re home!” and so happy to get inside to cuddle up and relax. We also seen lots of farm animals and deer around. Michael and Samantha responded within the hour and when asked for recommendations, Michael and Samantha suggested a personal phone call to see what kind of food we enjoyed and types of activities we liked, so they could share the best matched restaurants and places to explore. During our stay they reached out to see how check in was and if everything was running smoothly. They shared they weren’t too far away and to not hesitate to reach out if we needed anything at all. Overall, we would absolutely recommend Michael and Samantha’s Little Red Tiny Home Airbnb to friends and family!

3648,58,Micheal and Samantha was amazing host!! Loved the house and the area!
3649,58,We so enjoyed a peaceful getaway in this tiny home! Michael and Samantha were so hospitable and went the extra mile to make our stay great! The tiny home packs a lot into the tiny space and the views off of the porch are simply beautiful!

3659,58,We cant recommend Michael and Samantha enough! Absolutely beautiful and peaceful property. Wonderful hosts and a wonderful property for a couples getaway!
3660,58,Very nice and neat little place and great view of mountains!
3661,58,"Little Red was an amazing getaway! Super clean and cute. Perfect for a couple’s trip to the beautiful mountains of NC. Plenty of activities in Boone nearby. Awesome morning views of the mountains right out of the front door. The hosts were very polite, responsive, and proactive. A truly unique tiny home experience! Would definitely stay again!"
3662,58,We spent a few nights at this tiny abode to pass the new year and get away from the city. It served as a great launch pad for local hiking and for a getaway. Our hosts went out of their way to respond to questions and even brought an item we needed that wasn't listed in amenities on the listing. Loved the quiet atmosphere and could imagine spending a week there shacked up reading a few books.
3663,58,"This is a very cute and comfy stay for 2 people. It is pictured exactly how it looks on the listing. However, it is an very long drive with narrow roads with lots of twists and turns to get anywhere in the surrounding area. We were not expecting this place to be this far out of the way. Nonetheless, this was still a great trip with beautiful views from the tiny house."
3664,58,"What a serine location! Wonderful views, very peaceful! Enjoyed spotting deer grazing outside thru the front door windows each morning over coffee. Spotless and accommodating. The cutest little place for your getaway!"
3665,58,A truly beautiful and fascinating place to stay. Everything you need for peaceful weekends.
3666,58,Michael and Samantha were incredible hosts. When I had questions they responded with such urgency. They offered to come by if we needed anything at all. So hospitable and kind and even called me to thank me for staying. Best hosts I’ve ever had at a Air B&B. Above and beyond. Can’t wait to come back!
3667,58,"Michael was a gracious host with a very quick response time to questions.The Little Red Tiny house was pristine and peaceful with a gorgeous view. During our stay, we loved just relaxing and enjoying the quiet time with nature. Will definitely be returning to Michael and Samantha’s properties in the future."
3668,58,There's a special place in our hearts for Michael and Samantha's place. A very cozy and warm cabin with an amazing view tucked away on the NC/TN line. The cabin was beautiful and fully functional for two people. It stayed warm and toasty in the low degrees and was easy to find and check into.
3669,58,"We enjoyed our stay. They did a beautiful job with their tiny home, loved the landscaping and the setting. The interior was very neat and clean."
3670,58,"Wonderful, peaceful, and romantic are a few words that describe this awesome tiny home experience! We will be back! To top it off the host are perfect! Responsive, caring, and knowledgeable about the local area! Thank you Michael and Samantha for our first AirBnB experience."
3671,58,"Thank you, Jessica, for your kind words. We love hosting kind and respectful guests like you and your husband. We look forward to your return!"
3672,58,"Best hostess we’ve ever had! Michael and Samantha took the time too call and give recommendations about local restaurants and activities, very unusual for airbnb hostess to do! Very proactive and attentive to their guests. 100% recommend tiny red."
3673,58,"Thank you, Jazmin, for your sweet review! We appreciate fine guests like you. We hope you return soon."
3674,58,"Absolutely loved our little getaway! The house was so cozy and cute. You are not really close to any stores, so I would highly recommend grocery shopping ahead of time. We had so much fun using the grill to make breakfasts and dinners around the fire. Would highly recommend this stay!"
3675,58,"Beautiful tiny home in the mountains! Long drive up the mountain and to town, but that’s to be expected with these types of stays. Plus it’s accessible without a 4x4 vehicle!!!!!"
3676,58,Absolutely loved staying in Micheal and Sams place! It had such a lovely view and the grill and fireplace outside made it super cozy. The inside was charming and we loved the loft bed with unique wooden stairs. I would definitely recommend this place as a secluded getaway to find some quiet and peace. The host was also so kind and helpful!
3677,58,"A modern. well appointed small cabin, perfectly situated. Tucked in the mountains, with all the peace and quiet you desire along with unobstructed views of the mountains. We spent two night here and wish it could've been more. Thanks Michael and Samantha for being great hosts"
3678,58,"Thank you, Ian and Kash, for your kind words. Thank you for being a wonderful guests."
3679,58,"A wonderful getaway tiny house! Clean, quiet and great communication from the hosts. Highly recommended!"
3680,58,The little red house is an amazing place to stay for short or extended stays. We have stayed here twice and both times were excellent. The host are extremely responsive and make sure that everything is ready for their guests. We highly recommend staying for a romantic getaway. Thanks for an excellent location and stay.
3681,58,Perfect place for a quiet stay in the mountains. 25 minutes from Boone! Michael and Samantha were great hosts!

3684,58,We had a great time at the Little Red Tiny home. It was peaceful and relaxing with the most beautiful views. Everything was perfect.
3685,58,"Truly an amazing stay. Just as described. Very quiet, relaxing, beautiful tiny home nestled in a amazing location for a getaway. Far enough away for serenity but convenient to town. Will definitely be back"
3686,58,"Thank you so much, Josh, for your kind words!"
3687,58,We loved our stay and couldn’t have asked for a better first tiny home experience!!
3688,58,It was very cozy.
3689,58,We had the best time staying at Michael and Samantha's place for a few days. The leaves were changing color and we enjoyed walking on the short trail. They were wonderful hosts and checked on us throughout our stay. We will certainly be back!
3690,58,Very nice cabin
3691,58,The tiny house was super cute and exactly as described. We loved the fire pit and the views from the house were great!
3692,58,"Everything you need for a little mountain getaway. Beautiful scenery, loved the gas fire pit. We would love to return!"
3693,58,Amazing!
3694,58,This tiny house is everything you need for a great WNC stay! You can't beat the view and proximity to both Boone and Blowing Rock/Grandfather Mtn areas (approx. 30min from each) if you plan to visit other places. Super peaceful stay. Would definitely stay again!
3695,58,This listing is great for a getaway in the mountains. The views are beautiful and directly in front of the home! The tiny home is comfy and intimate. The hosts were welcoming and tended to our needs! You should definitely book this if you’re visiting the Boone area!
3696,58,"A tiny cabin that grew on me. It’s off the beaten path, but the road behind the property gets a decent amount of traffic. Great communication from the hosts. You can feel how much they want you to enjoy your stay!"
3697,58,The view is breathtaking it is a very clean environment exactly as described I would recommend this to anyone. We had a spectacular time can't wait to go again. Thanks again Mike and Samantha what a great idea you all had
3698,58,"What a wonderful nature-filled week at Little Red Tiny. If you enjoy listening to the crickets and cicadas and hearing owls call at night and gazing across the beauty at Grandfather Mountain and feeling like your living outside but with ALL of the comforts of a snuggly safe home, give this tiny house a try. I would love to stay here again. For a week of hiking in NC, VA, and TN, this location was perfect and absolutely beautiful to drive to all destinations. No matter where I went, I felt like I was in a postcard. A great space in a beautiful place. It is very quiet and private and outside of any town but with a neighbor or two close enough (but not too close). I highly recommend."
3699,58,This wasmy home base while hiking around WNC. It was wonderful. The tiny house is great and the view is phenomenal.
3700,58,Very cute place! Secluded! Nice views!
3701,58,"Expectations were beyond exceeded! This location is beautifully presented with an amazing view, very nicely kept yard with lots of space. The tiny house is very spacious for two people and provides a very calming atmosphere. I will definitely choose location over others the next time I travel in the area."
3702,58,"This tiny home experience did not disappoint! Beautiful location with lovely view. We enjoyed sitting by the fire pit at sunset with a glass of wine. Just perfect. The house itself was cute, cozy and beautifully styled. We enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back and recommend to friends looking for a tiny home experience. Check-in was a breeze and Michael & Samantha even checked in our first morning through the app to see how our stay was going. Excellent hosts!"
3703,58,This is a beautiful and peaceful place to stay! It was very clean and check in was super easy! It’s definitely a great value- I definitely recommend it!
3704,58,"My boyfriend and I are on a cabin hopping this week, and Little Red Tiny did not disappoint at all! The place was clean & cozy.
We went out for a quick visit at Grandfather mtn which is not too far away.
It was rainy during our stay so we weren’t able to use the firepit or outside grill, but everything still went out so smoothly! The highlight for me is waking up in the morning with an amazing view!"
3705,58,"Absolutely gorgeous. Very peaceful, quiet, and beautiful spot. The house was clean and cozy! Michael and Samantha were great hosts very communicative and kind. Close to downtown Boone, perfect spot for a romantic getaway. We will be back!"
3706,58,"Awesome mountain stay! The tiny house itself was beautiful, clean, and comfy. The view was spectacular. It’s a beautiful drive to get there and you are close to great hiking spots. We had the pleasure to meet Michael briefly, he was super friendly and helpful. We loved everything about this place. Safe to say we will be going back!"
3707,58,Little Red Tiny is an amazing vacation place to stay for great getaway with beautiful views. We enjoyed our stay everything was so clean and organized. Michael and Samantha were awesome host and communicated very well!!!
3708,58,Close to many great hiking trails and Boone for dinner.
3709,58,"Excellent, clean , lovely place,great Hosts. We are definitely going back!!"
3710,58,Would recommend this cabin was very clean and cozy and has a very good view of the mountains and a great place to stay to just relax
3711,58,Awesome! We loved the outdoor space and spent tons of time sitting by the fire looking at the beautiful view. This was our first time in a tiny home and we were definitely spoiled. Hope to be back again soon!
3712,58,"Thank you, Maddie, so much for your kind words! We look forward to hosting you again."
3713,58,Was such a cute place! Amazing views and great location to Boone.
3714,58,Our stay was absolutely amazing! The view was wonderful and the tiny house was so cozy and comfortable. Michael and Samantha were amazing hosts and were so helpful and quick to respond when we had questions or concerns. We are looking forward to coming back in the future!
3715,58,"Michael and Samantha were great hosts and were available in a timely manner when needed. The place was very clean, easy to find, and had a wonderful view!"
3716,58,"A beautiful and relaxing place with a wonderful view. A little ways away from town itself, but that just adds to the charm. I would definitely stay there again, if given the opportunity"
3717,58,I loved my time here. It was a beautiful scenic area. I was very comfortable in the home and enjoyed waking up to the birds’ songs.
3718,58,"This is such a great spot! Big fan of the tiny house, and the mountain view is unbeatable. Highly recommend!"
3719,58,"We had such a lovely stay here! The drive up was beautiful, the view was gorgeous, and the house itself was perfect. It had great atmosphere and outside at night, it was dark and quiet enough for incredible star-gazing! We will be back for sure."
3720,58,We are thrilled that you enjoyed your stay in the high country! Thank you for the good review. We hope you visit again soon!
3721,58,The tiny house is beautiful and perfectly comfortable with a great view of the mountains!
3722,58,This tiny home was perfect! The view was amazing and the house so cozy and clean. 100% recommend this place
3723,58,Thank you so much Kasey for your kind words and staying with us!
3724,58,"Wow! Perfect tiny house in a perfect setting ! Michael and Samantha went above and beyond to make our stay memorable. They are landscaping artists !!
Can’t wait to come back!"
3725,58,Micheal and Samantha were amazing hosts! Quickly responded to any questions we had and made our stay a great experience! Clean place with a beautiful view of the maintains. We would come back any time. Just keep in mind the closest city is about 30 min away
3726,58,One of most beautiful sceneries we personally have ever seen with our own eyes. The red tiny is extremely cozy I completely recommend to anyone wondering.
3727,58,Wow! Thank you Brianna!
3728,58,"This is a lovely tiny home with thoughtful, communicative hosts. Easy check in and check out. The propane fire pit is so nice. The shower is a bit difficult to use, but that's my only complaint. Thanks for a great stay!"
3729,58,Really enjoyed my stay at Little Red Tiny. The view was amazing! Perfect little place for a perfect little getaway!
3730,58,"Thank you so much, Amanda, for staying with us in both of our tiny homes! It was a pleasure meeting you and we hope you return soon."
3731,58,The tiny house was clean and neat with a fantastic view. Located in a great spot with plenty of things to do nearby.
3732,58,Had such a relaxing weekend in this beautiful tiny home! I would most definitely want to stay again!
3733,58,Wonderful! We are so glad that you enjoyed your stay. Please come stay with us again soon.
3734,58,The house was incredible! Great location with the most amazing view from the front porch. Couldn’t have asked for a better experience!
3735,58,We are so glad that you loved it! Please come back and stay with us again at Mountainview Tiny or Little Red Tiny.
3736,58,"Absolutely stunning! The place is literally in the mountains and the views are breathtaking. The inside is cute and cozy, very private and we felt safe the entire time we were there. The outside fire pit feature was a huge plus because you get to sit by it and enjoy the beautiful view ahead of you. The hosts were very communicative, caring and helpful—really great people! Overall a great place if you’re planning a little getaway to NC! We 100% would come back!"
3737,58,Thank you Rebeca for your kind words! We look forward to your return.
3738,59,"Super cute farm cottage! Pictures are right on. Very cozy, peaceful, and picturesque."
3739,59,"If you are looking for an adventure, this is for you. We are city folks and wanted to experience something different. We were not disappointed. The weather was horrible. Rained the entire weekend and very chilly. Trips to the outhouse was muddy and filling the bucket to flush was unpleasant. Outside shower was out of the question so we soaked in the hot tub to feel somewhat clean. Warm bodies, cold heads. We had our adventure for sure. We arrived after dark and Lori greeted us to help us get settled in. The cabin is small and looks exactly as pictured. Nearby Mt. Airy and Pilot Mountain filled my wife's shopping itch. Everything about this property was great. I just think hotel stays and cruises have spoiled us. Thank you Lori for sharing your cabin. And we don't blame you for the weather."
3740,59,"I absolutely loved this stay! I stayed solo and felt very safe. It was so peaceful, cozy, and comfortable! At night it was almost magical with the solar lights throughout the property. Some of the special touches I enjoyed were the hosts having a fire pit set up for me each night and fresh eggs in the fridge when I arrived. They had animal feed available to feed the farm animals - this is a must! They are adorable. There was a longer gravel drive to get to the property passing the neighbor with dogs - they didn't bother me, they'll just bark as you drive by slowly. I didn't actually use the hot tub but the set up was cute and private.
The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable and the loft was set up for relaxing and watching television on before bed. About a 15 minute drive to pilot mountain and mount airy for restaurants. About a 45 minute drive to hanging rock - be sure to check out the waterfalls! I will absolutely be staying again and would 100% recommend!"
3741,59,"We loved this rental. I was with my kiddo and she loved it more than I did. Loved the animals and feeding them. Snacks for the animals provided. Private setting even though the owners are close but they give you space. Lori gave us some marshmallows for roasting that we sadly didn’t get to use because of the high winds. She even had some bubbles for us to play with. The lights around the rental at night were cute. Lovely view of the stars. Keep in mind this is partially rustic with the bathroom but Lori explains the process and the toilet is in an outhouse a short walk away, but it is an actually toilet. It’s very cozy and hard to shut the door if have longer legs. But still private enough. Lori was great with communication. The inside of the cabin was great. Running water, AC, and heat. Which we needed both AC and heat for our stay with a high around 80 and a low around 45. The bed was so comfortable. If you want a unique experience, I would most definitely recommend Lori’s place."
3742,59,"Highly recommend this charming farm stay! Everything was as described, and photos can’t capture the beauty of the property and the magical feel of the cottage. Lori and her husband couldn’t be nicer—very responsive but gave me and my dog plenty of space. I’ll never forget the outdoor shower in the rain—no spa could beat it. Would definitely love to stay there again!"
3743,59,"Perfect in every way! Was just what we needed for an affordable night on a road trip. The location was relaxing and peaceful, and the space was very comfortable and nicely decorated. I would stay again and recommend to anyone. Very simple and easy check in and check out as well."
3744,59,"Wow! Lori and Daniel have quite the spot in a beautiful corner of North Carolina. Between the goats, chickens, and pigs, and Lori and Daniel's hospitality - I felt pleasantly at home during my solo getaway. So many highlights of my trip happened right there on the farm. From hearing goat sneezes early in the morning, to a curious chicken following me into my cabin, to being greeted after a long day with three fresh eggs - this was the best stay I've had in awhile. I'm in the process of convincing my mom to follow in my steps and venture out to this farmstay hideaway for some R&R. Lovely spot. Can't wait to come back in the fall."
3745,59,We had the best time at Lori's place! I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great farm experience. Lori and her husband are amazing hosts - very responsive and helpful. The chickens were so friendly - that was my favorite part. Thank you for a great weekend!
3746,59,"This place is like a little magical fairyland! The hosts are incredibly warm and welcoming. We made so many fun, funny, and unforgettable memories here. They thought of every detail, there wasn't one moment where we felt like something was missing! The cottage itself was clean, cozy, and comfortable. The town nearby was cute and had lots to explore. We will absolutely be returning here and recommending to anyone we know looking for a weekend getaway."
3747,59,"We stayed here while on a road trip, and both my guest and I agreed we would be coming back for a lot longer because we absolutely fell in love with the space and with all the wonderful touches that Lori did to make it feel like home. Being able to interact with the animals, having a wonderful hot tub (which Lori was so thoughtful and set up for us as we arrived late), and even having eggs and drinks waiting for us in the fridge were the perfect thing after a long day of driving. Lori was so responsive and flexible when we ended up running into some unexpected traffic and arrived late- she made sure we got in okay and really made sure we had a great time. I cannot recommend this place enough! It was so much fun!!! Thank you!!"
3748,59,Lori’s place is unbelievable. Perfect spot for a cozy getaway. Lori was super responsive and helpful. We’ll definitely be coming back!
3749,59,"The perfect place to stay. We needed a place to stay for a night and we couldn’t have been happier. Great people, very hospitable, and the place was super clean. We got to feed some farm animals and it was the perfect stay away from home. Thanks y’all!"
3750,59,It's very dark in the woods with unclear parking area loose dogs trying to get to my dogs as we were pulling up. Cottage entrance was unclear and I was alone. Requested refund as I couldn't reach host for any help so I left . Was told refund was possible. She charged my card and claimed she wasn't refunding me after all . That is very poor business if you ask me and not fair..I never went inside so I have no information on that .
3751,59,"We are sorry that your stay was not as expected. It does get dark here in the country at night, so there are motion and solar lights to parking and the cottage. There are no loose dogs on the property; though there may be neighbor dogs out near the road on the way.
We did ask that you text or use the Airbnb app to communicate with us and you did not.
When we spoke the next morning we discussed a possible refund of one or both days if you came out to the property in the daytime and let me show you around and let you decide if you wished to continue the reservation. You agreed but then changed your mind and texted your weren’t coming.
I immediately sent you a trip change request so that we could possibly rebook with another guest and refund you for the second night’s stay.
You did not send the request in a timely manner (12 hours) - this means the property could not be made available for another guest- and did not communicate further until the following day.
We are sorry that you weren’t satisfied but we tried in every way to accommodate you short of refunding you for an entire booking at the property that you chose not to tour nor free up for others guests."
3752,59,"Our stay at Lori & Dans was just what we were looking for and needed. Extremely private, cozy, and clean. They were both super friendly and responded within minutes of any questions that we had. From the sneezing goat (Boba) to the little pig escape artists (Dozer and Crash) it was a fun filled weekend that we will gladly visit again! Thanks Guys!"
3753,59,"Had a great stay! Absolutely loved the hot tub. The goats and pigs were precious, and loved the attention. Would definitely stay again! Even the outhouse was decorative and fun. 💛"
3754,59,Wonderful place such an amazing experience even tho it rain one day we still had fun staying in watching movies with our dogs even tho it was scary going to the bathroom at night I loved how quite and nice everything was amazing host thank you guys for giving us an amazing place to stay and welcoming us to your home we loved feeding the animals they are soo cute this was me and my husband first trip of the year alone and we loved the alone time and we loved the thrift stores near by and how everything is so closed just a 15min drive and you are near a lot of food and stores thank you we will definitely be coming back
3755,59,"we had a great time, thanks again!!"
3756,59,We really enjoyed our stay. We are looking forward to going back when the weather warms up. The hot tub was nice and warm. The ambiance of the cottage was perfect for us. It was a warm and peaceful setting.
3757,59,Piggies!! And goats. And chickens. This place was absolutely perfect. The cabin is cozy and quiet. The bed is super comfortable and perfect for snuggling. The animals were a bonus and all friendly. Lori left chicken scratch and goat snacks outside the door and the animals were excited to let us feed them. As an added bonus Lori left fresh eggs in the cabin for us to make breakfast with. We wish we could have stayed longer and hope to come back someday.
3758,59,"This is my new favorite Airbnb. Lori's offerings perfectly straddle the line between providing travelers with both a colorful experience and cozy, comfortable accommodations. Lori and her husband are both incredibly friendly and accommodating people, and interacting with them was a pleasure. The cottage itself is functional for any travelers' needs, complete with a fun and warm aesthetic, comfy linens, a kitchenette counter with a sink and cooking appliances, and fast wifi. There is a Roku with complementary Netflix, and the kitchenette came full of goodies (Including some farm fresh eggs for our morning). The outhouse, outdoor shower, and hot tub are clean and well-maintained, and offer plenty of privacy. Charcoal was provided for the fire pit outside of the cottage. Guests are even given jars of animal feed and have the opportunity to meet and feed the family pigs, goats, and chickens in the daytime. My wife and I are already excited for our next stay at this cottage."
3759,59,"This cottage was perfect for a little getaway. It was like glamping but without the tent. Lori was a wonderful host and was very communicative. The outhouse was something to get used to, but it absolutely added to the whole experience. Also, the hot tub in cold weather hit on a whole different level. I highly recommend this cozy cottage to anyone that wants to get away for a few days. I will absolutely be returning in the future."
3760,59,If you're looking for peace and tranquility this is the place. Wild animals help too.
3761,59,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this small but comfortable cabin. Pigs, goats, and chickens outside door, and the hosts provide jars of feed so you can feed them, which was fun. Trail to river was a nice walk on the property, and hot tub worked great with beautiful view of starry sky. The hosts are around but give you privacy and are very friendly if you choose to talk with them! I had never been to Mt. Airy and had a blast exploring the town. We also hiked a trail at Pilot Mountain State Park. Definitely recommend."
3762,59,"Lori’s place is so cute! While it is small & rustic, it is warm, cozy, & beautifully decorated. The bed is comfortable. It is quiet & peaceful. I appreciated the thoughtful details (esp the fresh eggs & doggy snack). The hot tub was heavenly. Although the owners’ house is nearby, the place still feels very private. The outhouse was def an adventure-esp in freezing temps. I loved the cute, friendly pigs & goats! I’ll definitely come back when it’s warmer, & I have more time to explore the farm/trails!"
3763,59,"Such a beautiful place to be, from the cozy touches inside to the relaxing hot tub and shower outside! Super responsive, respectful and kind hosts as well."
3764,59,"Wonderful place to stay, very relaxing and peaceful. Lori was very responsive and made excellent recommendations for local attractions. The animals were adorable and very friendly."
3765,59,My boyfriend and I had an amazing stay. It was the perfect place to stop on our road trip.
3766,59,"My boyfriend and I stayed for the new years weekend. We LOVED our stay. The hot tub alone made it worth the price. Adorable on the inside, Lori was a great host and very friendly and attentive. Would definitely stay again."
3767,59,"A wonderful experience staying here! So comfortable and beautiful! I highly recommend it to anyone wanting a bucolic setting. The hot tub was great, especially at night when the stars are out! Loved every minute of it!"
3768,59,"Lori & Daniel’s place was the perfect place for my partner & I to stay while visiting family in the Yadkin Valley. We came for Christmas during a polar vortex. Lori & Daniel ensured we were warm enough & had everything we needed. We probably would only come back in warmer weather so we could enjoy the amenities more, but we definitely recommend!"
3769,59,"This was the perfect weekend getaway for us and our pups! We loved hiking on the property with our dogs, chilling in the hot tub, and feeding the goats and pigs! Lori was the absolute sweetest and I loved her personal touches on the cabin we stayed in. It was so cozy!"
3770,59,"Amazing Airbnb, absolutely blew expectations away with the attention to detail inside the cabin. We spent the first 20 minutes just enjoying how cute it was. Enjoyed exploring downtown mt airy and the trail available on the property!"
3771,59,Very sweet and lots of great details in the cottage - I can tell it was thoughtfully set up! Would definitely recommend this Airbnb!
3772,59,"what a beautiful getaway we were just passing thru and we booked in with them and we absolutely love it 😊😊☺️ we want it to stay one more night and it was already booked because it was gorgeous 😍🥰 and all the details were perfect 😍we love the animals, the river walk and the peaceful of the place 😊"
3773,59,"Oh my goodness, those bells didn’t last a minute with those crazy goats! I’m glad your dog could use it hahaa☺️☺️☺️"
3774,59,Such a cute place and great host! They were beyond accommodating and everything was so cozy even on a chilly night. The check in details were exactly as told and communication stayed great throughout!
3775,59,Lori’s place the perfect place for our short getaway. The cottage was adorable and had everything we needed. It was safe clean and comfortable. The hot tub worked great and we had so much fun seeing all the animals! We would definitely rebook :)
3776,59,"We had a lovely time, the hosts were great, the cabin and areas were all beautiful plus everything you would need is there for you. They thought of everything. The Netflix fireplace was going and the cabin was very welcomIng on a rainy day. We stayed 2 nights and totally rested up. Went to cousin Gary’s to eat the breakfast buffet which was good too. The cabin is private even though you aren’t far from the hosts house. Literally never saw them except to say hello a couple times. Very friendly people, they made us feel comfortable and taken care of. The best part was the sneezing goat.. he was hilarious and seeing them was fun! The baby pigs were adorable!! We recommend this place & would love to stay again (maybe on a sunny day next time) Thank you for a great weekend."
3777,59,"Cutest little cottage with a great view, has everything you need and has a very cozy atmosphere. Goats are the best!!!! Definitely planning on coming back."
3778,59,"I arrived at Lori's farm on a dreary cold day after having driven for about 9 hours, and was greeted by a warm, cozy space with the thoughtful touch of a Netflix fire video on the TV :) This little cabin is pure magic - the farm is beautiful and Lori has done so much to make the house as comfortable as possible with everything you need. Even the outhouse has cute little touches. Lori was very communicative and I felt very welcome to reach out if I needed anything - but everything I needed was already provided! Thanks for sharing this beautiful property, Lori!"
3779,59,"This was the most peaceful perfect stay in North Carolina! Very private, clean! This Airbnb tops any other place I’ve been hands down! The owner’s took the time to make sure the cabin is equipped with everything you can ask or even think to have in your Airbnb! Also provided fresh eggs to cook in the Am in your very equipped mini kitchen! A ton of detail was put into this stay! Owner’s were also quick to respond and very pleasant to communicate with! They definitely make you feel very welcome and at home! Almost like visiting family! :) I can’t put into words how nice this place is from the hot tub to the outhouse! You have to come visit for yourself, you wouldn’t want to leave! Guaranteed! Thanks again for such a wonderful stay on the farm!"
3780,59,Super cute house! Loved the hot tub. Bed was really cozy. Perfect for a getaway weekend. The communication was great!
3781,59,Loved it here it was our first trip with our dog and he enjoyed it so much. So beautiful and if you love to walk through the woods and look at nature this is the place for you. Can’t wait to come back for another weekend away
3782,59,"That's exactly what my wife and I were looking for this weekend. Lori's cottage was beautifully and artistically decorated and it was super clean too!
We enjoyed the short hike to Ararat river. Our dog enjoyed it a lot. There were a couple of access points where he got to splash around in the water. The goats were very friendly and the chicken looked happy roaming around. The fresh eggs Lori offered us were very appreciated!
The location is great too; it's close to Pilot mountain, Hanging Rock and Mount Airy.
We would definitely stay there again if we got a chance!"
3783,59,"You guys were such wonderful guests- Kiwi, too (I’m so glad he had fun!), it was a pleasure hosting you all; would love to host you again any time!"
3784,60,"Great place, very peaceful and great accommodations. It was the perfect place for a weekend getaway!"
3785,60,"Awesome stay! Location was perfect, the views from the porch were the best I've seen. Everything was super clean, it's the perfect spot for exploring Asheville and the Smokies"
3786,60,"we had a wonderful stay here!! my husband and I wanted a short getaway for my 30th birthday and this was the perfect spot. the view was absolutely breath-taking, the kitchen was so cute with the retro appliances, the bathroom was something that dreams are made of, and it was just all around amazing. the TV was on a rolling cart so we could move it in front of the bed, and the Murphy bed was comfy! there were a lot of good restaurants nearby (highly recommend Angelo's italian). we didn't use the hot tub bc of some medical issues but we were definitely eye balling it the whole time! I texted the owners a couple of times and immediately got a response. highly recommend!!"
3787,60,"What an AMAZING, RELAXING location. If you are wanting a quiet, relaxing and cozy getaway then look no further. The studio was perfect and comfortable. Our entire stay was perfect from start to finish.

Would love to come back during the fall and see the beautiful landscape. We had a wonderful romantic getaway and just looking forward to being able to come back."
3788,60,"Great place. I would love to stay here again. It's very nicely decorated. The shower is huge and relaxing. The murphy bed is unique and was comfortable. The view of the surrounding mountains is fantastic! The Samsung Frame has an amazing picture. There is even a mini disc frisbee course on the lot (I won't give away the details - but it was fun and sounded great when you completed a hole!). Easy quick access to groceries, shopping and restaurants; however, back at the cabin you feel away from the hustle. No guilt in doing nothing or getting motivated to jump in the hot tub, swing in the tree swing, go on a hike, or read a book - it was all good."
3789,60,"awesome stay, one of the best airbnbs I've had the pleasure of staying in."
3790,60,Second time staying here and it did not disappoint!!! Love the privacy and the luxury of this place. Can’t wait to stay again!
3791,60,"great little place. we enjoyed our stay, minus the unfortunate weather we had in our stay. The only thing of note is the inside part of the door handle wanted to keep coming off, we just put it back on each time."
3792,60,Thank you for letting us know about the door handle John - we will get that taken care of.
3793,60,We went for our wedding anniversary and it was a perfect weekend getaway!! Everything was exactly as the listing. The view was breathtaking and the cabin was adorable! Wonderful stay!
3794,60,"Such an amazing mountain stay! The cabin is so cute and very clean. Bed was super comfortable. I would bring shower shoes just because the rocks can be a little uncomfortable and the cold water pools, spacious shower though! It is pretty dark outside if arriving in the evening. The walkway up to the cabin is lit up. Overall such a great location with great views!"
3795,60,James and Kristie are the best hosts! The cabin is cozy and quiet. Great for a relaxing get away and still close to town.
3796,60,This place is definitely worth the money. The cabin is fully stocked with kitchen and bathroom needs. The view is amazing and is only a short drive to town/hiking trails. The bed is more comfortable than expected. The hosts were also on top of everything and respond quick when something comes up.
3797,60,Absolutely stunning place. I wish I had booked it for longer! Perfect location and had everything I needed.
3798,60,Pictures just don’t do it justice! The place was truly beautiful. Would recommend to others!
3799,60,"We had an amazing time at this place! My husband and I were looking for a romantic getaway near smoky mountain National park and this fit the bill! We would go on a long hike. Then return for grilling, fire, and a quick hot tub session. It was absolutely relaxing and exactly what we needed."
3800,60,"Stayed here for mine and my boyfriends 5 year anniversary and it was a lovely stay! We enjoyed every minute of it and loved them area. Exactly as described, perfect view, and the most comfiest bed! Definitely would recommend this place to any and everyone:)"
3801,60,"Thank you for hosting my parents. It was a beautiful, peaceful stay."
3802,60,Beautiful view. Relaxing place to stay.
3803,60,"This place is special! The amazing views and hot tub are perfect for relaxing and enjoying the mountains. The location is great, remote but close to grocery stores, hikes, the blue ridge parkway, and easy access to get to Asheville. The cabin is cozy but has everything you need."
3804,60,"This cabin is just beautiful and the pictures don’t do it justice! It was secluded and still very close to town, we couldn’t have picked a better place!"
3805,60,This was the mist relaxing beautiful place I have stayed. It was just what we needed to get away from the hustle and bustle. Waynesville was cute and quite. You can tell they are in a revival phase but i was so happy yo be there when it wasn’t so crazy. If crowds are what you want and lots of activities this may not be the place but if you want to get away from it all book immediately!!Y inly suggestion would be to have a code to be able to send electronically for the house cleaners as I never have cash in hand and would have liked to tip them!
3806,60,"Beautiful, stylish and fully equipped cabin with everything you could wish for. Immensely comfortable bed and spacious bathroom. Such a stunning setting in the forest! We’d love to come back…."
3807,60,"This was a
Wonderful home that we loved spending time in. The location is great, although you will lose cell reception about a mile out from the house, but their WiFi works great! Recommend for any couple looking to get away."
3808,60,Great for a romantic getaway! We’ve stayed twice and will definitely stay again!
3809,60,Quiet and peaceful.
3810,60,"Great mountain getaway! My husband and I spent our honeymoon here. Waynesville is an awesome little town with great restaurants, shops, and more. Beautiful scenery, privacy, drivable to Asheville and the Biltmore Estate.

The morning view of the mountains, the hot tub, fire pit, and Tuscan feel of the cabin made it a great romantic getaway!
Highly recommend!"
3811,60,Awesome place in a great location!
3812,60,"What a beautiful place to spend a few days in a lovely place, enjoying privacy, and nature. It's easy to see that James and Kristie have gone above and beyond to make their place a one-of-a-kind experience and my husband and I enjoyed our time here. Waynesville was a cute town to spend some time in to shop and catch a bite to eat. The area is beautiful and we spent several days driving the Blue Ridge Parkway, hiking, and checking out Asheville and Sylva. James and Kristie have created a great place to relax and rejuvenate in style."
3813,60,"Perfection! Keep an eye out every night around 8:45 pm for the owl in the large tree in front of the deck. We saw him twice over our week stay, such a treat! We loved being located right in between all of the popular sights - smokeys, blue ridge mountains, Asheville ect."
3814,60,"This is a great, quiet getaway! My wife and I came here to relax after our wedding and it was perfect. The kitchen is well stocked, which was great for cooking. And it’s not a far drive to Asheville and some great trailheads in the Smokies. Host is super communicative. We had a great time!"
3815,60,This is a perfect place! Book it! It’s worth it!
3816,60,"Great mountain retreat! Easy accessibility to the GSMNP and Ashville, NC. The hosts are considerate, clean, and offer a great view of the surrounding mountains."
3817,60,fantastic stay! and a GORGEOUS view
3818,60,Great get away. Little pricey but the hosts were very accommodating. It was a great place to go to get away from things.
3819,60,An amazing place
3820,60,"Cannot say enough about this stay! It was a fabulous choice for our anniversary trip. The location was perfect, not too far from town but it felt like we were in a world of our own. We felt right at home - anything we needed was made available. The view is breathtaking and the cabin was stunning. We would love to visit again!"
3821,60,Impeccable property with amazing views. The accommodations set up by the host allows you to begin enjoying your stay immediately. Perfect property to enjoy for your entire stay or use as a base camp to enjoy several outings from the local area. We will visit again!
3822,60,My husband and I spent our honeymoon here & it was fantastic!
3823,60,Great stay! Loved the views and the access to the hot tub. Very unique property!
3824,60,"Amazing place definitely a must stay if your visiting the area! Great views, awesome setup, clean, hot tub facing Mountain View and fire pit!! Will definitely be returning in the future!"
3825,60,We had a great time. We loved the area and the town was really nice and reminded us of home. The views were fantastic and the hot tub was 10/10.
3826,60,"What an amazing view from a very well appointed home. Secluded property, luxury furnishings, can't say enough good things about this place. Can't wait to come back."
3827,60,We absolutely loved this cabin! Incredible views and every detail of this place was completely perfect. Even things we didn’t expect. They went out of their way to ensure our stay was at the highest premium and communicated all details well ahead of time. We highly recommend this place for a romantic getaway you’ll never forget.
3828,60,"This was our second time staying here - we love it! It’s beautiful, a true getaway. Even with lots of rain, it’s cozy and comfortable. We will be back - again!"
3829,60,"Absolutely fantastic. Completely isolated — didn’t see a single soul other than three or four cars driving up the road.

Murphy bed is shockingly comfortable — absolutely no issue sleeping. Bathroom is incredible. Hot tub as advertised. Absolutely zero complaints with any of it. Would stay again and will recommend for folks I know nearby."
3830,60,Peaceful and quaint cabin in a location convenient to downtown Waynesville. Great amenities and exactly as described. It was exactly what we were looking for on our anniversary getaway weekend.
3831,60,"This cabin was absolutely beautiful. The views are stunning, and the cabin is amazing. You can tell a lot of thought was put into making the cabin wonderful, and we appreciated it all. After a day of hiking, we loved coming back to the cabin to enjoy the hot tub or deck area. The shower & bathroom is gorgeous, and the kitchen appliances are awesome. The Murphy bed has such cool features as well. I loved all of the details of this place. We hope to come back!"
3832,60,"My wife and I chose this property for a “mini-moon” escape after our wedding, and we could not have been happier! It was a perfect mix of seclusion while still being close to necessities and James was on top of everything we needed without fail. We cannot recommend this property enough!"
3833,60,"The views are breathtaking, and the cabin is SO cute! My husband and I stayed a few days while on our mini honeymoon traveling in the mountains and this was the perfect place to get away but still close to Asheville. Waynesville also has a nice little Main Street for shopping/dinner/drinks.
The hosts have literally thought of everything here, it’s by far our favorite Airbnb we’ve been to. Everything is labeled and screenshots so theirs no confusion, the hosts also had wonderful instructions on getting there, getting in, they made brownies! We were iffy on the pull down bed and it was ridiculously comfortable. Perfect romantic little honeymoon spot:)"
3834,60,"This place is amazing---the photos don't do it justice.

We spent four nights at James' place and had a blast. The best night we cooked local trout (from the trout farm in town) on the grill while watching the sunset by a fire! Frisbee golf course is a blast too (fun thing for a quick game). The views are stunning and the full (super equipped) kitchen allowed us to cook most nights.

Waynesville is charming with some great food and a can't miss Brewery (Frog Level) by the water.

1 hour from AT, 1 hr from Art Loeb. 1 hr from Cataloochee. perfect!

would 110% return."
3835,60,"This place is an absolute oasis. Truly one a kind, lives up to the hype and then some. Perfect balance of remoteness with plenty of hiking trails around but still close to downtown area with breweries, restaurants, and shops. The cabin itself is absolute stunning- it is crafted with so many intricate details. We highly recommend booking this for your next getaway adventure! We will be back"
3836,60,Incredible experience and stay so thank you James and Kristie for sharing your home with us for the weekend! Everything was very clean and organized and we had absolutely everything we needed for a relaxing mini honeymoon in the mountains! Will definitely be back!
3837,60,"Amazing place off the beaten path that was a serene, relaxing spot to day trip to the Smokies from! The studio is very spacious, kitchen well-appointed, and hot tub perfect after some long hiking days. Disc golf was a nice little addition and board games available for rainy days. There was a random frost that caused all the trees to drop their leaves just before we arrived but enjoyed watching the leaves grow day by day and tons of birds were always visible with less foliage covering. Beautiful view from the deck and hot tub! Check in and out process was seamless and James was very responsive. Would love to stay again!"
3838,60,"Cabin is exactly as described with unique furnishings, comfy bed and awesome hot tub. Located just a short drive from downtown Waynesville made this cabin a perfect stay for my wife and I to reconnect."
3839,60,"My boyfriend and I had the best time here! The place was gorgeous, the hot tub was amazing and the view was breathtaking. The hosts were extremely quick in responding & very accommodating for any issues we ran into..the entire trip, check in/out process, etc. was all a breeze. Definitely will stay again, highly recommend this for anyone looking for a quiet, peaceful & relaxing getaway."
3840,60,This was definitely a one of a kind cabin. Everything about it was beautiful!
3841,60,What a lovely site and view! The setting is incredible - remarkably peaceful and serene - while being just a short drive to downtown Waynesville. And star gazing from the hot tub on a chilly night was the icing on the cake. Would highly recommend for a romantic retreat!
3842,60,This was such a great little place. We eloped and got married right on their patio with the beautiful Mountain View in the background. The space was clean and close to the parkway and Waynesville which has a lot of cute places to visit. Hopefully we will be back next year!
3843,60,"we enjoyed a great anniversary getaway here! you seriously don’t need to bring anything besides yourself!! the house is completely equipt with everything you’ll need! we cooked a few meals in and we had everything we needed. the location was very close to downtown waynesville and only 30 mins to asheville. we absolutely loved our stay, everything was exactly as listed!"
3844,60,Beautiful cabin in the woods outside of Waynesville. It’s super close to the Blue Ridge Parkway and there are tons of hiking trails. The cabin is clean and has several amenities. We highly recommend this stay and hope to return.
3845,60,"My husband and I came for our honeymoon and we couldn’t have asked for anything better. The cabin is so homey and peaceful. Waynesville is a dream town. The proximity to everything is perfect. If you want a literal dream trip, stay at this cabin. You will be hard pressed to find something better"
3846,60,"Wonderful, cozy cabin with all amenities. The host had great communication and answered all questions promptly. The cabin was clean. Would definitely stay again."
3847,60,Beautiful and peaceful stay! My boyfriend and I cooked all of our meals and they had an amazing kitchen filled with all of the tools and kitchen basics we could possibly need! Super clean and very well decorated inside and out! We even found a cabinet filled with cards and board games! We especially appreciated the booklet they put together with instructions for how to operate everything in the home and a bunch of recommendations of local food and activities! I would love to come back another time of year as the view was stunning even for winter! I’m sure it would be even prettier during spring or summer! 100% recommended for a relaxed and peaceful vacation spot!
3848,60,"My fiancé and I adored this place. We loved how close it was to Asheville but still felt like a bit of a retreat. The bed was so comfy, and we couldn’t get over how nice the sheets were. The hot tub was wonderful! Highly recommend!"
3849,60,Such a lovely spot for a weekend getaway!
3850,60,We had an amazing and relaxing time! The hot tub was perfect after a day of hiking and James thought of every detail to make everything very comfortable and easy. This was easily one of our favorite stays!
3851,60,"We spent the week here as part of our honeymoon and loved it. It was the peaceful get away that we were hoping for. The main room had plenty of space when the murphy bed was stored and the hot tub was the perfect spot to stargaze from. The only caution is the driveway that leads to the cabin is gravel and partially washed out and if you have a small car with little ground clearance you will most likely bottom out making it up the driveway. We will definitely be booking again in the future. It is a great spot to visit Asheville, Waynesville and even a easy drive to Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg."
3852,60,"If you want romantic and secluded then this is your spot. James was quick to respond, the detail to how things were laid out and decorated was beautiful, the banana bread was DELICIOUS, I enjoyed reading The Brothers Grimm book of tales, the open windows and natural light, the French doors to the patio and the best part of the house is hands down the shower. Plenty of dishes, towels and blankets. Superbly clean. Would stay again."
3853,60,"Beautiful home in a secluded location. Very quite, peaceful but very clean and well equipped home. Kristie and James were very good on communicating about littlest thing."
3854,60,Highly recommend. My wife and I recently stayed for our Honeymoon. We had such a hard time leaving. It doesn’t get any better than this. Beautiful views and cozy atmosphere. It was perfect. We especially loved how there’s a guest book for everyone to sign and leave a little personalized note. 10/10
3855,60,This is an amazing house for a honeymoon! The location was perfect for all the activities we had planned. Waynesville is very cute and you are only 30 minutes from Asheville. We totally recommend this AirBnb!
3856,60,"Meticulous attention to details - extremely descriptive directions to the house, nearby attractions, restaurants, and even labeled items around the house! Labeled light switches should be a requirement for an Airbnb! The complimentary homemade banana bread, with some coffee, made for a perfect morning on the porch overlooking the autumn mountains! Perfect place for our honeymoon, we could not have been happier!"
3857,60,"This home exceeded our expectations! The interior decor is both beautiful and practical; the space is used so efficiently and there was every comfort that we needed for a relaxing time including a variety of kitchen appliances, extra toiletries and linens, and yummy banana bread. One of the best things about the house is the amount of windows (each with a shade that can be pulled) that lets in the natural light and allows occupants to see the surrounding woods. The French doors that make up the front of the house can be left open, and their corresponding screen doors closed, to let in the breeze. Be sure to enjoy a drink in the evening or coffee in the morning on the front porch to enjoy the rising or setting of the sun on the surrounding mountains for an awe-inspiring view. We enjoyed lighting a small fire in the stone fire pit in the evening and the hot tub was perfect for relaxing after a day of hiking."
3858,60,"What a magical place. I loved watching the light change on the mountains.
Great place to explore the mountains to the west of Asheville."
3859,60,"This cabin is soooo great! Extremely cozy and has everything you could want or need. Highly recommend the banana bread and the jacuzzi! Location is perfect. Far enough away to be secluded and not hear traffic. But only 3 miles away from downtown. Kristie was very communicative with us, and super friendly. Hoping we can make it back for our mini-moon next year!"
3860,60,"This cabin in the mountains is a gem! Close enough to town for a little adventuring but secluded enough to be private and quiet. The view from the deck is gorgeous (especially with the leaves changing in the fall) and the hot tub is very relaxing.

A great place to unwind and escape the world's realities for a little while."
3861,60,We had a wonderful stay at James' place. Quiet location with a great view!
3862,60,"Very private and clean cabin with great smoky mountain View’s. Location was also great as about half way between Asheville and Great Smoky Mountain National Park. Lots of great hiking and drives very close by, but also convenient to Asheville for shopping and dinning needs."
3863,60,My husband and I absolutely loved our honeymoon stay in this beautiful cabin. The views were breathtaking! Kristie was so friendly and a wonderful host! I recommend this stay for anyone looking for a perfect little getaway!
3864,60,"We really enjoyed our stay at this cabin. It's really cute and the pictures are accurate, though they now have a TV instead of the chair in the corner. We didn't really turn it on. I think one huge plus of this place is that it's actually not all the way up a mountain, with tons of windy roads (I get car sick), AND is only 10 minutes from downtown Waynesville, but still manages to have a killer view. The hot tub felt so clean and brand new. Appliances are adorable. Be warned there's no dishwasher! (My fiance said: we're the dishwasher.)

A couple small caveats: It's not long, but they aren't kidding about the bumpy road on the driveway up. This stay is not for someone in a low-riding sports car. Second, I didn't notice that the bed situation was a murphy bed, even though it is shown in the photos both folded up, and pulled down (I thought it was a different perspective and/or didn't notice). The murphy bed is fine, but is super creaky. The mattress was very comfortable but both of us tried to stay very still while sleeping because any movement easily woke the other person up. We never folded up the bed the whole time we were there, and didn't find it in the way, so I'd have preferred just a regular bed in the studio space. This is super minor though. If you can find free nights, stay here!"
3865,60,My husband and I stopped for our honeymoon on the way back to WI. It was the perfect halfway stop! The hot tube was perfect - our favorite part!
3866,60,"Amazing place to stay, the cabin so cozy, views amazing, location amazing, we will definitely be booking this cabin again for future trips!!"
3867,60,Our stay was so relaxing! The cabin is exactly as described and pictured. They have games stocked and a small frisbee golf course set up on the property. The kitchen is stocked for just about any of your needs. The place was clean and secluded.
3868,60,The view was worth it all. Would have enjoyed if the hot tub had been accessible some other way than by outside slate stairs down the side of the house. Overall amazing and very clean.
3869,60,"Hi Kelly, Thanks for your review. Our studio cabin is small and quaint and there just wasn't enough space to put a hot tub under the covered porch. We also wanted guests the ability for star gazing at night and a covered area would have sheltered the stars. We are sorry you experienced rain during your stay. We hope that the photos on the website accurately showed there were no covers over the spaces you mentioned. I will review and make sure other guests aren't under the same assumptions. Thanks again for staying with us."
3870,60,Beautiful place to stay and conveniently located near Waynesville. The view does not disappoint.
3871,60,Great location with beautiful mountain views. So peaceful watching the sun come in on the mountains while enjoying your morning coffee. Perfect spot to feel like you’re away from it all yet convenient to everything you need. Loved our stay!
3872,60,Book it! Don’t wait. You will not regret it. My wife and I had the most relaxing week in a long time. The views and cool mountain air are good for the soul. The property is just as advertised. We hope to be back someday in the future.
3873,60,"If you are looking for a peaceful mountain escape, this is the perfect place! The views are amazing, the location is in a quiet spot, and the cabin itself is beautiful. Also, if you enjoy hiking, there are a ton of beautiful spots nearby and the hot tub at the cabin is the perfect end to a long day. The hosts are very informative and quick to reply. 100% recommend you stay here if you get the opportunity!"
3874,60,Great stay!
3875,60,"MY FAVORITE AIRBNB YET!

Such a beautiful space located on a beautiful property. Loved its location (close to Smoky Mountain National Park AND Asheville—Waynesville was super-cute, too!) The inside was so cute (all SMEG and Big Chill appliances that are Midcentury Modern-inspired… be still my heart)! And the outside is to die for with the huge upper and lower patios with beautiful mountain views… I truly didn’t want to leave! If I’m ever back in the area, I’d 10/10 stay here again.



Only negatives: the Murphy bed is pretty noisy if you roll around at night and the final bit of road up to the Airbnb is pretty sketch—we were supposed to have a Mustang as our rental car but that didn’t work out and I was glad we were in a SUV with higher clearance. They say you can get up there with a car, but I’m a pretty nervous driver and wouldn’t have enjoyed it if we were in something lower."
3876,60,We had a great time and would definitely stay here again. The location was lovely and Waynesville is such a fun little town. We found some great gravel roads close by for riding and had a wonderful wknd.
3877,61,"Had an enjoyable stay, everything was nice and private!"
3878,61,The place was beautiful and very clean! The hosts were responsive and friendly. Definitely recommend this place!
3879,61,"Had a wonderful stay, enjoyed the hot tub the most. Very private and perfect for a get away."
3880,61,"Thank you for the wonderful space, we’re always looking to leave places as great and better than we arrive. It’s a pleasure to be able to adventure the world and super glad you have made another great space to stay over!"
3881,61,A great place for a quiet getaway! Truly wonderful hosts that accommodated to all the concerns we had! Recommend this spot for everyone.
3882,61,Amazing place… recommend!
3883,61,Loved the space - it was so cute and perfect for our stay . The jacuzzi was amazing and the location was so close to all the amazing places !
3884,61,Everything was so neat and Tim and Carrie had great food recommendations. It was such a comfortable and peaceful space after a long day around Wilmington. Will definitely be back!
3885,61,"The place is so cute and cozy. Everything was great. Perfect as it’s name says it “the great escape” it was just that for us. The hut tub was my favorite part of our stay. The only little thing we had was about the heater, it refused to work on our last night. Apart from that everything was great!"
3886,61,Amazing place to stay especially for couples!
3887,61,The hot tub and string lights outside were the highlight of this stay! We really enjoyed our time here.
3888,61,"This was the best experience that I have ever had with an Air BnB. Everything was laid out so nicely, and the decor of the home was to die for. The expectation was exceeded and much more and I am thankful for the time we had there. The hot tub was the main attraction to the home and yet a very much well needed piece. I would recommend this home to anyone to try in the Wilmington North Carolina area it is worth every penny."
3889,61,Great place. Just as advertised. Loved it!
3890,61,"Great space. It is attached to their family home, not loud but worth noting. They’re great hosts, this wasn’t our favorite of their locations but good nonetheless. There were multiple bees/wasps and mosquitoes in the outdoor area that made it slightly hard to relax in the hot tub but that may just be cause it is at the beach. Overall a good stay."
3891,61,very nice place
3892,61,"I only stayed one night just to have a small getaway but this place was perfect! Convenient location, not too far from the beach and around great places to eat. The vibe at this house was perfect and I will definitely be coming back to stay again. ❤️"
3893,61,"Perfect little weekend getaway! VERY CLEAN! Pics are exactly what you get. Super cute little spot and made you feel at home. Quiet and private. The hot tub was wonderful too! Tim & Carrie were great at communicating all the details, making check-in/out painless.

10 / 10 stay!"
3894,61,Beautiful space and great hosts
3895,61,It was great! Loved the hot tub and the privacy
3896,61,Everything was great.
3897,61,Nice little getaway for 2!
3898,61,Had an amazing stay with my girlfriend in Wilmington at Tim and Carrie’s. The hot tub area was great and got to catch up on my book in the hammock! Highly recommend best bang for the buck couple stay.
3899,61,Had a wonderful weekend celebrating my husbands birthday at The Great Escape! It was very clean and nicely decorated. We loved soaking in the hot tub. Very private and peaceful. Tim and Carrie were excellent hosts and we would love to return!
3900,61,"This place is a little gem! My husband and I had a free weekend and we wanted to getaway to the beach for a couple of days. It really is the perfect ""landing spot"" for the weekend, and the hottub is a huge bonus. Everything was as described, if not even better!"
3901,61,Just as described; it's a cute studio space. The yard and hot tub area were private even though the house is on the corner lot. Very happy and would certainly stay there again.
3902,61,"The place was very cute, cozy, and well maintained. I enjoyed my stay."
3903,61,"Everything as promised, the hot tub was very relaxing and a lot of thought was put in to making the place feel like home. Great distance from everything in Wilmington and Wrightsville Beach!"
3904,61,Would recommend 100%
3905,61,Great place to stay. The hosts are very sweet and easy to get in touch with. Beautiful little place with a nice hot tub and a very comfortable bed. Well worth the money!
3906,61,Awesome! Relaxing and pretty.
3907,61,The house was gorgeous! Very clean and tidy….smelled wonderful! Hosts were extremely welcoming and accommodating. The private hot tub was amazing! My husband and I will definitely be back in the future!
3908,61,"This place was just what my fiancé and I needed for a short getaway. Cozy, inexpensive, and close to the city."
3909,61,Good place to lay your head for the night. Location was the biggest perk of this place in regard to how close it was to downtown Wilmington (just a short Lyft or Uber). Also close to Mayfaire.
3910,61,great place in a great neighborhood.
3911,61,"Is small and comfortable, and the instructions were clear. all the questions I did have were all written on paper, so I didn't have to bother them. wasn't far from the town or the beach. It was wonderful, had no problem what's so ever. it was very decorative."
3912,61,"This was the perfect place to relax and unwind. It provided a quick stop for the night, was very clean and really private and quiet. I loved the hot tub and the beach was so close it was well worth the pit-stop. Thank you Tim and Carrie!"
3913,61,"Rental is as-advertised. Comfortable, clean, and the hot tub and private courtyard are perfect!"
3914,61,"Great place to stay for a short trip! It’s a quick drive to the beach, and the home itself is very clean with great amenities."
3915,61,We just wanted a relaxing place to stay. It was approx 5 miles from Wrightsville Beach and the same to downtown Wilmington. Convenient location in our eyes. Will definitely see if this place is open then next time we in the area for a weekend getaway or a vacation.
3916,61,"Beautiful place, comfortable bed, and so clean!

The hot tub had enough chlorine in it that I had an allergic reaction (stinging eyes, burning skin in a few areas) and couldn’t stay in for more than a few minutes, which hasn’t happened to me before, but this might not be a problem for everyone.

I loved the high ceilings and the lovely details everywhere, including the makeup towels! Really a great stay."
3917,61,"I stay here often when in town visiting my parents.
Lovely place"
3918,61,It was amazing
3919,61,"Everything was just as described, and I had a great stay here."
3920,61,We came here for our mini honeymoon before Christmas and it was absolutely perfect! This is the cutest Airbnb I have ever stayed at and the location was perfect! Hosts were very responsive and gave us their recommendations of things to do and places to eat in the area. I love this Airbnb and its perfect location! Highly recommend for anyone looking for a nice comfortable getway!
3921,61,My boyfriend and I needed a place for one night and it was just what we needed! It was very clean and cozy and the hot tub is in great condition.
3922,61,"Such a lovely escape ! The home looks exactly like the pictures, everything was tidy, and wifi worked great — which is a must for me ! Clear instructions are provided for everything you may need.

The hosts are very nice and responsive. LOVE the hot-tub feature. Private and quite neighborhood.
Will surely return!"
3923,61,My husband and I stayed here for a night away just the two of us and it was perfect. Very private and quiet while still being convenient to everything we wanted to do. It was well stocked and exactly as described. We would definitely return :)
3924,61,It was a lovely little spot. Great for a couple who wants to have some fun and a little escape where they stay. The hot tub area is clutch.
3925,61,Will definitely book again. Had an amazing experience.
3926,61,Great stay!! Highly recommend if you’re visiting Wilmington
3927,61,Awesome place to stay. Beautiful and relaxing inside!
3928,61,Great place. Central to downtown Wilmington as well as Wrightsville beach. We enjoyed our stay there. the hot tub is a wonderful addition.
3929,61,"Enjoyed our weekend getaway in Wilmington at this cozy place, nice and clean. Def took advantage of the hot tub soaks! Only there for a short period of time, but our stay was most comfortable."
3930,61,Great place to stay and have a relaxed couple days!
3931,61,"Great cozy place that’s near a lot! They had recommended restaurants with descriptions and how close they were! Love the outdoor area with lights around the hot tub, very aesthetically pleasing!"
3932,61,"Tim and Carrie did an amazing job at making such a small space feel so comfortable and cozy! I really appreciate the fact that we could check in at 2pm. I would love to stay here again, the bed and sheets were so comfortable and the hot tub was clean and relaxing. I can’t wait to plan another date night with my husband here. This might sound crazy but they even provided good toilet paper! Often people skimp on certain items like that but they did not! Additionally, I love how they had a make up removal towel. I hate staying places and getting makeup on their white towels.

The only thing I wish they had was a Keurig/coffee bar. I would have loved to wake up and enjoy coffee near or inside the hot tub in the morning before check out. This isn’t a complaint though, I would stay again regardless of this. Next time, I would just bring my own.

Lastly, the decor inside was so beautiful! I really can’t say enough about this Arbnb. Thank you so much for making our night so memorable."
3933,61,"Tim & Carrie have done a very nice job in making a cozy and private space.
My husband and I enjoyed our stay!"
3934,61,Stayed for one nigh while in town. Would definitely return!
3935,61,"Everything is accurate and correct as advertised. The location was inside a neighborhood but it wasn't a problem finding it on the map.

Where the hot tub is, that part was fenced off and well taken care of. It was very neatly decorated and was very peaceful at night, as well as the neighborhood being quite.

I gotta say this is one of very few Airbnbs that have their kitchen utensils cleaned and ready for use, usually I check a couple plates and utensils and they looked like they haven't been washed since the last use.

The bed was very comfortable and is great for 2 people. The tv placement may seem like it's not ideal since it's on the right side of the wall next to the bed, but you could rotate it and fix it to your liking so that cancelled that out.

This Airbnb is inside a house and their is a family living there but during our stay we heard nothing through the walls and also had no loud or disturbing noises.

Over all it was very well cleaned and separated from the rest of the house. I would book again, Tim and Carrie are great hosts, friendly, and super nice. I would book again if I stayed in that area again!"
3936,61,Cute little back house 😍 Hot tub was so nice and such a little outdoor oasis. Super clean as well! Thanks for the great stay!
3937,61,Perfect for some alone time or a couples weekend. Nice neighborhood and very secluded.
3938,61,"I had such an awesome time here! So close to downtown Wilmington and Wrightsville beach. So cute, cozy and clean. Absolutely recommend!"

3940,61,Amazing place
3941,61,"This stay was incredible! Location was perfect, close enough to downtown but not so close that you hear the traffic. Loved the decor, the hot tub."

3947,61,The hot tub and outdoor courtyard were a dream and the Airbnb was so spacious and had really good recommendations for food nearby!
3948,61,"We stayed here for my husbands first 70.3 Ironman and the location, comfort and hottub was everything we needed. Tim and Carrie were thorough with communications so we had no issues getting there and getting settled."
3949,61,"Tim and Carrie have a lovely place! This is perfect for the weary traveler and made us wish we were staying longer. The hot tub was a dream, the decor was inviting, and the tv had lots of options. Would definitely stay here again if coming through."
3950,61,An oasis in close proximity to the pier and anemities

3964,61,Fantastically beautiful and near everything. I look forward to returning in the near future.
3965,61,The jacuzzi has a lot of chlorine and it was burning our eyes and our nose was runny. Maybe invest in some ice cube trays as well but other than that… everything was AMAZING. We LOVED it and thank you all ❤️.
3966,61,Beautiful little room for a beach getaway!
3967,61,"Loved it - very clean and quiet and very convenient location.
Would for sure stay again."
3968,61,"Super Clean in Smells Amazing! Very Quiet neighborhood! The Patio HOTTUB gets a 10 in my book, having different areas on the body that the jets hit just enough to relax you. I slept like a Newborn!
I can't wait to come back!!
Thanks Guys!!"
3969,61,"This stay was perfect for my boyfriend and I’s quick weekend getaway. The pictures were very spot on. There was a private entrance to the stay and it was very easy to get to. The stay was attached to the host house. However, we could not hear them at all. The hot tub was right outside and fenced in for a private relaxing area. This place was literally just so perfect! About 15-20 minute drive to Wrightsville beach but plenty around."
3970,61,"Great location, you can drive to the beach in under 15 mins. So many restaurants near by."
3971,61,"We had the best time during our stay here! We had everything we needed and it’s in a great central location. Minutes from the beach, close to lots of restaurants, and shopping. We explored the cargo district, the river walk, historic Wilmington, and the beach. The best part of this weekend was the beautiful porch covered in grapevines for our morning coffee. Would definitely recommend this place to everyone looking to stay in the area!"
3972,61,"Beautiful place to stay. Quiet neighborhood very close to restraunts, grocery stores, and downtown Wilmington. Very clean and well maintained. Only issue was the hot tub being over chlorinated to point we couldn't use it but I'm sure this is not a normal occurrence considering how well the airbnb is taken care of."
3973,61,Looks amazing inside and the outside hot tub area is a real vibe 🙂
3974,61,"such a wonderful place to stay. the hot tub area is so inviting. when I walked Inside, the room truly met my expectations. Tim & Carrie communicated well. if you are looking for and affordable place to stay a short drive from many of the area beaches and waterways this definitely is the place to stay!"
3975,61,"This place is amazing and was worth every penny! The hot tub was perfect, having a private fenced area added to the beach getaway. The location was conveniently close to the boardwalk, rides, and parking. The pictures don’t do justice, the place is very spacious. Would definitely recommend to any future guest and I would stay again."
3976,61,Love the hot tub
3977,61,Enjoyed
3978,61,"This was a great place. It’s close to just about everything. The hot tub was great and the unit itself is a cozy little 1 bed room, 1 bathroom space great for couples"

3981,61,Great place to stay for one night in town! Quiet and cozy. We enjoyed our time away from home exploring wilmington.
3982,61,"We stayed here to come scope out the area and apartments. This was the perfect location to get a feel of the area. We had no issues with our stay. The room had everything we needed. Check in was super easy. You would never know it was attached to the house, very quiet and really private. 10/10 would recommend."
3983,61,"My husband and I were visiting Wilmington for a few days and this little place was perfect for us! The room/property was well maintained, clean, and very tidy! The room smelled so nice and clean when you walk in. It’s in a great area, not too far of a drive from different areas of Wilmington! The hot tub was such a nice relaxing treat too after a long day of exploring! I definitely would recommend a stay here!"
3984,61,Only stayed a day and will most definitely be back!! It may just be a go to whenever I come to town !! Thanks a lot !!
3985,61,"Tim and Carrie’s rentals are our favorite choice when we want a convenient place to stay for a beach weekend getaway. The check in/checkout processes are frictionless and the units are in a great central location in Wilmington. We discovered a great place to get dinner and a drinks just 6 miles away called the Mess Hall this trip. Also, the hot tubs are always a delight."
3986,61,The place was perfectly set up for what I needed. I would highly recommend the location and the hot tub is a great extra touch!

The hot tub and hammock were a great place to relax and the hosts were communicative and easy check in. Fabulous stay!"
3989,62,"My husband and I immediately relaxed the minute we pulled up to the Water Retreat! The view is outstanding! Big picture windows framed the river outside. We spotted a bald eagle, and enjoyed a gorgeous sunset with cold drinks left by the hosts! Fishing off the decks was great fun! We enjoyed eating and shopping in historic Swansboro. Our hosts left us delicious eggs and bagels and plenty of spices to cook a wonderful breakfast. The chairs, sofa and bed were extremely comfortable and cozy! Thank you for such a wonderful weekend!"
3990,62,We had a wonderful stay at the Water Lover’s retreat! Amazing views and sunsets. There’s a lot to do in the surrounding area as well. We can’t wait to come back!
3991,62,This was our first Airbnb stay and it didn’t disappoint. Dianne was wonderful and helpful. The cottage was just as described and even better than expected. My husband and I felt at home and said we will definitely stay here again!
3992,62,So pleased your first Airbnb visit was such a success and thank you for the great review.
3993,62,"This was one of the best AirBnB experiences that Rosannne and I have ever had. The cottage is cozy and perfect for two. The entire front wall has windows overlooking the beautiful White Oak River and estuary. Dianne was so helpful and responsive to our needs. Ron helped me get used to the kayaks and gave me great advice on fishing the mouth of the river and the local creeks.
We both enjoyed the kayaks. Rosanne and I both spent time in the wildlife preserve at Cedar Point. Rosannne was able to see two new bird species and got several great pictures.
We just scratched the surface of what we can do in the area. We WILL be back!"
3994,62,Thank you for your great review and will take care of your request in the am. Cheers and happy holidays. Dianne
3995,62,"Loved staying here, wonderful place to kayak.... very peaceful."
3996,62,So happy you enjoyed and thank you again.
3997,62,"Okay, let me start by saying that all of the 5 star reviews are well deserved. This house has everything mentioned in the listing and more. From our first contact with Dianne, it's been an absolute pleasure with every contact. The house was perfect for our getaway! We arrived later in the day, just in time to see our first sunset. The bread and fresh cut flowers were nice and the snacks held us over while deciding on a place to eat and we found many options in the house manual/guest book. Our first sunrise was more spectacular than the previous sunset. (Amazing that you can see both while enjoying the view from this house!)

Everything was taken care of for our stay. I think we could have arrived with our clothes and the rest was there; even breakfast for our first morning. The house is well stocked with quality items throughout; kitchen has nice dishes and pans, living room with blankets, bedding was very comfortable with plenty of pillows, bathroom has nice towels and all the needed amenities. There's even a CD player with CD's.

If you're going to be anywhere near Swansboro, do yourself a favor and stay with Ron and Dianne."
3998,62,Thank you Shane for the high praise. Also for the excellent feedback regarding the extra mirror and I know exactly where to place.
3999,62,"Water Lover's Retreat is a well planned, well equipped, very quiet and well located retreat for one to base their sightseeing and adventuring near the Crystal Coast and the towns of Swansboro and Beaufort."
4000,62,"Thank you Chris, your positive feedback regarding the attention to detail is appreciated."
4001,62,You wonder when you read reviews before going somewhere and every one is a 5.0 and is so complementary in every category if it can be true. Turns out it is. Wonderful stay. Look forward to the next one.
4002,62,So pleased you enjoyed and look forward to your next visit.
4003,62,"We found this cottage 5 years ago and now we have finally visited it. We found it just after our vacation in 2017 and made already plans for a new trip for 2018 and booked it right away.

Hurricane Florence literally blew the plans away and we didn’t make the trip to Swansboro and stayed in Atlanta. In 2019 we went to an other country and, you know why, it was not able to travel to the USA in 2020 and 2021.

I have to mention that this is not the first time I visited this place several times the first time was back in the mid 90’s and the last time was in 2005. I was so glad that I would be able to visit it again and now I could show it to my partner. It was really worth waiting.

First of all the hosts are great! The communication through the years went very smooth and easy with a quick response. They were also very helpful and a lot of information is available. It was very nice to meet them in real life. Despite the fact that their own house is close by, you have complete privacy. The unique selling point of this charming cottage is the location, the view over the White Oak river is wonderful.

It is a wonderful place to relax and unwind. In the early morning we spotted a few times the dolphins. The cottage was spotless clean and a lot of amenities were present as well in the kitchen as the bathroom. All you could wish fore is there. The freshly baked bread was delicious and the best bread we have eaten during our stay. The swivel chair in front of the window gives you the opportunity to enjoy a wonderful view of the water. The bed was very comfortable.

In the evening it is wonderful to listen to the rippling water on the veranda.
It is recommended to use the kayaks that are available on the private pier. Try it a few times and before you know it you kayak to Jones Island across the Creek with beautiful small beaches.

If you want to see more of the area you can visit the charming city of Swansboro or go to the beach in Emerald Isle which is just a short drive of 15 minutes. You can reach the nearby grocery store in just 10 minutes and on the key chain there is even a reward card.

Dear Dianne and Ron, thank you for giving us a very special stay!
Robert & Jasper"
4004,62,So pleased you enjoyed the bread and thank you for the wonderful review. How fun to see the deer as you were leaving.
4005,62,"Dianne and Ron have been exceptional hosts. The cottage was in impeccable condition, with plenty of food for us to start our stay, super well equipped and with all details taken care of. The view is spectacular, they were very helpful with the pedal kayaks and board paddles and they were instrumental for us to have an unforgettable Labor Day weekend. We strongly recommend this property for your stay, and we’ll be back!"
4006,62,Thank you for the lovely review. So pleased you enjoyed. Look forward to seeing you again.
4007,62,"We have stayed at many air b&b / Vrbo places over the years & Dianne’s place was top notch. Her little touches made it special & very welcoming. Lovely spot right on the intercostal. We kayaked right out in front of the cottage to Jones Island & saw lots of fish, dolphins, birds, etc. Only about 15 minutes drive to a public beach access on Emerald Isle. Cottage was perfect & was 5 star plus all the way! All you really need are your own personal items & Dianne provides the rest. We cooked in most meals & she had ample cookware & a few spices. Bed was comfy & so was the furniture. Super clean & welcoming. I highly recommend! Great mother - daughter getaway. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
4008,62,So pleased you both had such a wonderful time and thank you for the great review. Seeing the dolphins is always special.
4009,62,Water Lover’s retreat is a 5 star stay! Every little extra detail was noticed and appreciated by my husband and I during our stay. We were able to sit on the porch for hours listening to the water through the steady breeze every night. We would gaze at the stars and gorgeous sky. The little cottage was perfect. Ron and D are awesome!
4010,62,"You are most welcome, so pleased you enjoyed."
4011,62,"Nice little house right on the ocean with easy access to the surrounding area. Dianne is easy to contact for anything needed. Overall a great experience, thanks for the wonderful week!"
4012,62,"We had a great time, lovely cottage in a great location.

Beautiful views, host went above and beyond.

Looking forward to staying again :-)"
4013,62,You are most welcome and thank you again for your kind words.
4014,62,"Such an amazing time! The cottage is adorable with a view you simply cannot get tired of! The simple amenities like homemade bread, toothbrushes, shampoo, etc was such a great touch! We used their kayaks and had so much fun on the lake. We’ll be back!"
4015,62,Thank you for the great review and so pleased you enjoyed. Hope to see you again.
4016,62,"The Waterlover’s Retreat is the perfect little getaway. Dianne and Ron are wonderful people and do an amazing job hosting. The cottage has everything you need for a relaxing and restful stay, as well as a great place to play (kayaking, fishing, checking out the local beaches). Our week-long stay was so much fun and we are already planning to come back."
4017,62,Thank you for the wonderful review. We have had guests comment on your sheepshead photos....they love them!
4018,62,"This cozy waterfront cottage has everything you might need for a relaxing stay! From the crisp bedsheets, fresh-baked bread, bowl of local strawberries (in season, of course), to the amazing view, it's the perfect location for a quick weekend escape or a more extended vacation. I've made several trips here and it's always a highlight of my year. Emerald Isle, Swansboro, and Beaufort are all within short drives for local excursions. If you prefer to stay put, there are kayaks to borrow, docks to fish from, and a hammock to nap in. Leaving is such sweet sorrow, but there's always the next visit to look forward to. Thank you, Dianne and Ron!"
4019,62,Wonderful to see you both again and very pleased you found out cottage a few years ago.
4020,62,"After just finishing my second stay at Dianne and Ron’s cottage, I am already looking forward to returning in August! As before, the cottage was immaculate; the location perfect; and the hosts couldn’t be more welcoming. With the great fishing and waterfront location, the cottage is truly a water lover’s retreat."
4021,62,So pleased you enjoyed and look forward to seeing you in August.
4022,62,"Dianne and Ron have a magical place, and I’m so thankful they’ve shared it on AirBnb. They nailed every detail that made the stay convenient. From bread, cheese, and butter, to toothbrushes and floss.

We went out with their amazing kayaks and saw dolphins and and an otter as well. It was an unforgettable trip."
4023,62,Thank you for the kind review...very special to be kayaking with the dolphins.
4024,62,Such a beautiful stay! definitely recommend choosing dianne & ron for your vacation. very gracious hosts. had all the small touches a home should have. look forward to returning sometime in the future.
4025,62,Thank you Ave. So pleased you enjoyed your visit.
4026,62,"Great private bungalow right on the water. Very welcoming, clean, private, quiet and very relaxing. Sitting outside overlooking the intercoastal waterway was one of the most enjoyable parts...lots of wildlife to watch including dolphins! Dianne and Ron are geat host."
4027,62,"Thank you Jim, so pleased you enjoyed."
4028,62,"Awesome place to stay! We didn’t want to leave. The cottage was so clean, comfortable & well equipped with everything we needed. The water view was stunning. The fresh loaf of artisan bread that Dianne put out to welcome us was delicious. We are hoping we get to return!"
4029,62,Thank you Beverly. Enjoyed meeting you and hope to see you in the future.
4030,62,"Dianne's ""Water Lover's Retreat"" is all that and more... We couldn't ask for a better place to unwind, relax, and refresh one's views of the rapidly changing and disruptive world we all share... we highly recommend this little slice of paradise for anyone needing to take a break from the ongoing demands of the dailiness of life..."
4031,62,Thank you Jim. Enjoyed meeting you and Vinny and pleased you were able to relax and rejuvenate.
4032,62,"My husband and I were celebrating his retirement and we're looking for the perfect place to stay. We definitely found it! The moment we pulled up Diane and Ron welcomed us and were such gracious hosts. They pointed us to great restaurants and the were there if we needed them but give you lots of privacy as well.

The moment you walk into the space you feel at ease. The first thing you notice is the amazing view of the water from everywhere in the cottage. You can wake up in the morning sit up in bed and are greeted by the view. You can be making dinner in the lovely kitchen and see the view or be sitting on the comfy sofa and look out across the water. Just magical!!!

Another guest in their review gave the pros and cons and said the only con was having to leave this amazing place. We agree...

If you are looking for somewhere to unwind and yet have an area full of things to do and see this is the place. We can't wait to come back again."
4033,62,"What an amazing experience it is to stay at Dianne's place! She has clearly thought of everything down to the smallest details (there were even band aids!). The view is incredible, the space well-stocked, clean and cozy and all of the surrounding water is amazingly accessible. Dianne was attentive and lovely to interact with and we had such a great time. We would absolutely come back!"
4034,62,So pleased you had such a great visit and thank you for the kind words.
4035,62,"Water, water, everywhere! Dianne & Ron have the perfect water lover’s retreat! The views are stunning from sunrise to sunset. Dianne had taken care of all the details that made the accommodations comfortable and easy! There was so much to enjoy on the property and in the surrounding waterfront areas, which were just miles away. We hope to return to this haven again and again!"
4036,62,So pleased the cottage felt like home and you enjoyed the goodies and your visit. The sunrises and sunsets are our favorite. We hope to see you again.
4037,62,"This was our third time staying at WLR and it is our happy place! We instantly relax when we walk in the door! Always extremely clean, very comfortable bed, linens, furniture. Fresh delicious bread and flowers greeted us as well as a few staples to get us started. We were there for my husbands birthday and Dianne even had two divine cupcakes from a local bakery. Very thoughtful touches.
Unfortunately we had to cut our trip short because of circumstances at home beyond our control. Dianne was very understanding and easy to deal with in our checkout process. She goes above and beyond! Hope to be back again soon!"
4038,62,We always enjoy hosting you and Ben and look forward to seeing you again soon.
4039,62,"Pros:
Very clean & comfortable. Amazing water views. Breathtaking sunrises and sunsets. Extremely well stocked. Over and above special touches that cannot help but to give you a glimpse of how much the hosts want to share their little piece of heaven.
Cons:
At some point you will need to leave.
Thank you Dianne and Ron for being the SUPER hosts that you are. Our stay was perfect and on the drive home were discussing how soon we may be able to return. We know that returning again and again is the best solution to the only con we found.
Thank you."
4040,62,"What a wonderful and kind review, thank you. We look forward to your return visit."
4041,62,"Stunning water view, beautiful cottage, super nice hosts, and very relaxing. Would come back any time."
4042,62,Thank you for your kind words and hope we will see you again.
4043,62,"Dianne and Ron are superb hosts. Super friendly, facilitating, but respectful of privacy. Upon arrival we found a sparkling clean cottage, nicely decorated and appointed with very comfortable furniture (including a bed with a wonderful mattress), and a thoughtfully chosen assortment of food and drink to tide us over until we could go shopping. The cottage is right next door to Dianne and Ron’s home, but we had our privacy, while being close enough for assistance when needed. We had a fine time pedal kayaking on the river, bicycling in Onslow County, and visiting the lovely aquarium on Emerald Isle. The only downside that we experienced during our fine stay was from all the military activity in the area. Lots of jet aircraft (none at super low altitude, thank goodness), and frequent explosions off in the distance from Marine training exercises at Camp Lejeune. Some actually rattled the cottage! (The Marines we’re quiet on our last day, so perhaps that is more the norm.) Even considering this, we had a restful, rejuvenating stay at the Water Lovers Retreat."
4044,62,"Thank you John for kind words about us and the cottage....so pleased you left feeling rested and rejuvenated. Yes the Marines were noisy. Thankfully, Camp Lejuene's training practices are infrequent. I apologize that you were disturbed."
4045,62,Come prepared to leave the cares of life behind and bask in the welcoming atmosphere Dianne has created--right on the water. You will lack for nothing. We were SO blessed here.
4046,62,"Best Airbnb experience we have ever had. Dianne and Ron were friendly and accommodating beyond expectations. The cottage is just perfect, clean, comfortable, unbelievable views and has everything needed for a fantastic stay. Directions were easy and all instructions great. We keep talking about how nice everything was. The furniture is super comfortable and the kitchen is equipped with everything needed to cook meals. The bathroom was nice beyond description and there was a washer and dryer available. Everything worked perfect. Best stay ever. Plan to return."
4047,62,Thank you so much....your review means a lot as you have stayed in many Airbnbs!!! We hope to see you again.
4048,62,Dianne’s cottage welcomes with a panoramic view of the waters of North Carolina. You can see sunrise and sunset! Great fishing on the deck or from a kayak. No amenities overlooked. If you want to leave the peaceful cove there are plenty of beaches to explore on the many barrier islands. Loved it all!
4049,62,"Thank you Nancy, so pleased you loved your visit."
4050,62,I had the pleasure of recently staying at Dianne and Ron’s Water Lover’s Retreat for over a month. Everything about the cottage and the location was absolutely wonderful. The cottage was very clean and fully equipped for my long stay. It has an unobstructed view and is located just 10 feet from the edge of the bay. The fishing was excellent from the host-provided kayaks or right from the attached deck. Our prize catch was a “monster” 28 inch long red drum caught from the cottage deck! Thank you Dianne and Ron. I look forward to returning as soon as possible.
4051,62,"So pleased you enjoyed your stay... we enjoyed meeting you, hosting your visit and look forward to seeing you soon."
4052,62,"This place is amazing! You can’t beat the view from the cottage windows and the amenities are above-and-beyond. Dianne communicated with us a few days ahead of time to give us all the details for check-in. When we arrived, the cottage was extremely clean and there was fresh baked bread, our first breakfast, snacks and treats for the week, and a few beverages in the refrigerator, along with fresh cut flowers on the table :) Ron was helpful in showing us how to set up the fishing gear and how to use the kayaks and crab traps. My husband and I spent the week fishing from the kayaks or from the deck every morning and evening. The cottage is very close to Emerald Isle beaches and many other various activities. But there is so much to do at the cottage from fishing and kayaking to relaxing in the hammock or enjoying a home cooked meal with a view that’s better than any waterfront restaurant. Thank you Ron and Dianne for sharing this beautiful place with others! We are looking forward to staying here again in the future."
4053,62,Thank you so much for the wonderful and detailed of the cottage and the area. We enjoyed meeting you both.
4054,62,"WLR was just amazing! Dianne and Ron are the best hosts. The cottage is the perfect spot to get away from the vacationing crowds, but still be close to everything to feel like a beach vacation. The hosts were so friendly and informative with ideas of where to go for dinners and willing to assist with fishing and crabbing if we wanted. I would highly recommend to anyone and we cannot wait to go back at some point to stay again!
Jody and Jim Mawhinney"
4055,62,So pleased you had such a great time. :-)
4056,62,"we love Diane's place! so many personal touches. fresh bread, all amenities you could need or want. beautiful views. loved kayaking right from the house. loved the area. we drove out to Beaufort, emerald isle, and downtown swansboro. we enjoyed our stay so much. cannot wait to return."
4057,62,Thank you Dan. So pleased you loved your visit. We feel the same about being able to step out of the house into a kayak. Look forward to seeing you both again.
4058,62,"Are you ready for breathtaking views, warm hospitality, peace, pin-drop silence, a place to regroup and take a break from wife. The cottage offers all of that and so much more. A hidden gem and out of all the Airbnb I have ever stayed it is ranked #1. The immaculate setting and lovely fresh baked bread were truly a bonus.

Thank you Dianne for making me feel quite special with all the added special touches you provided.

I will be back again!

Kind Regards,

Gee"
4059,62,Thank you for wonderful review and it is our pleasure to host you...please do return for another visit.
4060,62,"Second time staying here and have already booked next years trip! Dianne is thoughtful and attentive. Ron was kind in sharing bait and fishing tips with my husband. They were available yet respectful of our space. Rental is better than described! Location is perfect, extremely relaxing and gorgeous. Loved sitting on the front deck each day. As far as inside, Dianne has equipped the cottage with everything you need and even things you didn’t know you needed! Bed linens were high quality, place was spotless when we arrived. Fresh homemade bread and cocktail/breakfast items were all ready when we got there. We have stayed at many many Airbnb’s and vrbos through the years, and this is by far, at the top of the list!"
4061,62,Thank you for your excellent review and appreciate all the positive feedback....see you next year.
4062,62,This was our second year at this lovely property. Dianne and Ron are the perfect host and hostess. They provide every last detail for a spectacular vacation. The cottage is very well appointed and you will want for nothing. Time spent there will make beautiful memories for years to come.
4063,62,"Thank you for your kind words and love your comment about ""beautiful memories""!"
4064,62,"Just completed our second stay at WLR and had another fabulous week on the water. The house was very clean, well appointed and had plenty of 'goodies' left for us to enjoy. The water views from inside and out are spectacular and you truly feel like your staying on top of the water. I was also lucky enough to land a nice 25"" long Red Drum which we had for dinner that same day. We will be back next year for sure."
4065,62,Thank you John for the lovely review and appreciate how much you and Rebecca enjoy your visits. Look forward to seeing you in 2022
4066,62,"I've stayed at this wonderful cottage multiple times, and every time, it's so hard to leave! Pure relaxation in a comfortable, peaceful retreat that comes well-stocked with everything you might need, but forgot to pack. Location and atmosphere keep me coming back!"
4067,62,Thank you for the lovely review and believe you and Katya have the record for the most visits! which we really appreciate. Look forward to seeing you again soon.
4068,62,The cottage was wonderful! The view was spectacular when waking up every morning or sitting out on the deck at sunrise. Dianne offered a helpful guide book that showed places to eat or visit while we stayed and made the trip one to remember. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone!
4069,62,"I have nothing but good things to say about our 10 day stay at Water Lover’s Retreat. Having had extensive experience as AirB&B guests, we would rate this experience at the top. The cottage is plenty spacious and features a panoramic view of the White Oak River estuary. The porch overlooks the bay and invites hours of sitting and listening to the waves below, if that is your choice.

Nearby Swansboro is a nice town full of restaurants and shops, all described in Diane’s meticulous Resources Book. Three kayaks are available on the property for as much paddling around the bay as you care to do. If you like to fish, we watched our host pull flounder and other fish right off the dock on a daily basis. Also plenty of hiking around the area.

The cottage is extremely well organized and the amenities are high quality. Diane and Ron are perfect hosts and clearly take pride in providing a great experience. They are also nice people.

We would recommend this property as an excellent value and an experience we will remember fondly.

Sean"
4070,62,"Thank you for your kind words about the cottage, location and us :-)."
4071,62,"We couldn’t have asked for more. A quiet location, close to amenities and a view to beat all views. I worked the week from the dining table and it was the best of work weeks. My husband spent the week exploring. The weather changed through out the day....rain, wind, sun, and fog. The wildlife is abundant both fish, foul and dolphin! The thoughtful touches and fresh bread made it extra special."
4072,62,"Thank you for the great review....I love the ""best of work weeks"" comment. So pleased the bread was a success!"
4073,62,"Cannot say enough about this charming Retreat like get away cottage. We happen to have some rainy days but loved the wall-to-wall views of the water from inside the house. Lots of birds and other wildlife such as dolphins and river otters are so heartwarming to see. This lovely cottage has absolutely everything top-notch that you could ever want. We did a lot of cooking and enjoyed how thoughtfully the kitchen was laid out and equipped.
The hosts were above and beyond helpful and accommodating. The homemade bread and other goodies tasted 100% gourmet! Feeling so relaxed and grateful and excited about when we will get to go back again. Thank you thank you Dianne and Ron!"
4074,62,"So pleased you enjoyed the cottage, and thank you for the great review/feedback. Fingers crossed for sunshine during your next visit."
4075,62,"My wife raved about this place from the moment they alerted me they arrived. They were able to kayak and apparently, my son became a hammock aficionado while there. All my wife has told me is how much she is looking forward to going back and that next time I have to go because it's just perfect, she said it's small but was perfectly sized. My son took the upper area so he could do school and have a little privacy. I am really looking forward to rebooking after hearing them talk about how much they were able to just relax."
4076,62,Thank you for the lovely comments! We enjoyed meeting Christine and Grayson and look forward to meeting you too.
4077,62,"Water Lover’s Retreat is a perfect getaway - gorgeous views of the water, every comfort of home, and a secluded feel but still close to necessities. We particularly loved having access to the big green egg for seafood grill suppers. The kayaks were a huge perk as well - we could run down to the pier for a quick sunset paddle or take them out all day for an epic adventure. Dianne and Ron were lovely hosts and gave great advice about where to go and what to do. And I’m very cautious about pandemic safety, but when Dianne explained their airing-out and cleaning protocols, I didn’t have a minute’s worry. I can’t think of one thing I’d change!"
4078,62,Thank you so much for the lovely review and feedback on protocols. So pleased you enjoyed your adventures and visit.
4079,62,"Absolutely amazing! From the hosts, views, and home...you won’t be disappointed!"
4080,63,Great farm atmosphere quiet and peaceful
4081,63,We enjoyed our night! Very comfortable and relaxing! Loved the area and seeing the animals!!
4082,63,The peaceful haven we needed!!
4083,63,We loved staying on the farm! This is the perfect place for a peaceful and relaxing time- being on the River made it even better. Even though it rained a lot we loved the space both indoors and outdoors. The breakfast basket is worth it- we thoroughly enjoyed eating such a fresh meal that we got to cook ourselves.
4084,63,"We had a quick mother-daughter getaway at this farm stay. We were impressed with everything, from the cabin to the friendly animals and beautiful surroundings. We can’t wait to come back!"
4085,63,"We booked Mandy’s place last minute, less than four hours before we would check in. We booked this location in order to enjoy South Mountains State Park, before spending time in the city of Asheville.

Our host was responsive and the place was absolutely perfect for us! Outdoor string lights were twinkling when we arrived, soft music was playing in the cottage, and a couple of wine choices (for purchase) were available. We definitely needed it, after a long drive from across the state. Her sweet little dog even greeted us at the door.

The cottage was cute, very clean, and had everything we needed. The breakfast basket (for purchase) was sooo good the next morning. Mandy’s thoughtful touches made this little cottage the best Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in."
4086,63,"We thoroughly enjoyed our weekend on the farm. Mandy was super helpful with communication and we were delighted to meet Tyler and her in person. The cabin was exactly as pictured and was very comfortable. The breakfast basket was wonderful! Loved the farm animals, especially the chickens and sweet dog!"
4087,63,"Mandy's place is definitely worth the money. It was clean, comfortable, and charming. The river on the property is gorgeous and I love waking up to chickens right outside. I chose to add on the breakfast and it was delicious. I also bought a wine available in the cottage and it was also great. Lots to do nearby including South Mountain State Park, Lake James State Park, Brown Mountain, Old NC 105, etc."
4088,63,"Highlight of our anniversary NC trip!

Can’t say enough good things. Place was super cute, clean, well-thought out, coffee/water/sodas/snacks/basic toiletries, games, binder of local places to eat and things to see…and that’s just the inside! Outside is even better- short walk past cute piggies to a calm and secluded river, chickens walk right past the door and give the best side-eye. Sweet greeters Maddy and Tiger (and a calico whose name we didn’t get) act like they’ve known you forever. Tiger walked with us to the river and waited up the hill the whole time we were down there, to escort us safely back to the cottage. Friendly cows, a scratchy pig, horse, donkey, and a duck who seems to appear out of nowhere…it’s so fun and relaxing (all the animals, none of the work ;) ). And breakfast! Get the breakfast! So good- fresh and as local as it gets. We chose to eat the sausage inside out of respect for scratchy pig. Will keep an eye out for those t-shirts! Hosts were super friendly!"
4089,63,So fun to stay on this farm! The animals were so great to wake up to! And they were so friendly . Mandy and her family were so lovely . Nice to just hang in the rocking chairs or by the river as well. Oh! And- definitely get the breakfast basket .. farm fresh eggs andddd super tasty sausage !
4090,63,Mandy’s place was exactly what I was looking for. I loved it in every way! Very comfortable! Highly recommend it to others who was peace and quiet!
4091,63,"The farm was absolutely beautiful! I felt right at home and enjoyed the animals right outside my door! The space is decorated so well, and I did not want to leave!"
4092,63,"I don't think you can get a better spot than this. Mandy and Tyler were extremely kind and responsive. Highly recommend the breakfast basket, it's worth every cent. Maddie the dog and Ally the cat were incredibly friendly. We cannot express how much we enjoyed our stay here."
4093,63,"The family's dog Maddie appeared magically to greet us upon arrival and then again in the morning when we walked to the river. She was worth the entire stay! The setting was idyllic even in mid-winter so we can imagine it is beautiful in each season and that in the summer the crystal clear river with a stretch of sand-covered bottom would be the perfect swim spot for young children. Everything we needed was provided in the cabin, just as advertised, and it could not have been cleaner."
4094,63,This beautiful cozy place will make you feel right at home! Mandy was very welcoming and responded very quickly to any requests that we had or needed. I also enjoyed staying on the farm and waking up to seeing the animals right outside our window. It was overall an amazing experience. I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking to relax and get away with a friend or spouse to a private and quite area!
4095,63,"We had a wonderful stay! The host was very responsive, helpful and welcoming. We really enjoyed looking at all the animals, walking to the river and enjoying the farm. Very clean and well maintained with a really friendly dog my son loved engaging with. Planning to stay there again in the spring or summer!"
4096,63,"My wife and I decided to book this place as a Christmas present “getaway.” The goal of the weekend was to get away from the business of life and to spend time together. Morganton is a quaint little town. There’s a few nice restaurants, breakfast spots, breweries, wineries, lots of hiking opportunities, etc! Was perfect for a little get away.

The Airbnb is next to the owners house, which I was a little worried about upon arrival, but we didn’t even see them once. There was definitely enough privacy! And we were able to walk around the property and see the farm animals and river which was beautiful. The Airbnb’s back window overlooks the farm. The building was exactly like the pictures. Had basic cooking supplies, tv with dish and Netflix, towels, wifi, etc! Bed was super comfy! There was coffee and powdered creamer which was nice! We chose to do the breakfast basket which was fun to make and delicious!

We would highly recommend this place to another couple for a little getaway!"
4097,63,"I stayed at this Airbnb the day before the South Mountains Marathons. The location to the race couldn't be beat! It is off the beaten path, cell reception was spotty, and was just so peaceful to sit outside and watch the animals (which is EXACTLY what I was looking for)!
I had a nice little surprise after dinner of a pup waiting on me to get home. I sat outside with her and crocheted while she snuggled until it was getting a little cold.
Overall I have told EVERYONE about this little house, and am going to try and book it for the race again next year!"
4098,63,"This was the perfect place to stay for two nights with my girlfriend. We both loved the setting and waking up to see animals outside our window. Take advantage of the hiking trails nearby like South Mountain, unplug and relax in the rocking chairs after your day."
4099,63,Very friendly family and great place for getaway
4100,63,"Exactly like description, and then some!!! I would highly recommend to anyone! Very cute and the owners have thought of everything for the Guest. They go the extra mile for the guest! Beautiful farm! The Airbnb was clean, cozy, and safe! 10 stars!!!!"
4101,63,So beautiful! Very peaceful and relaxing get away!
4102,63,"My husband and I stayed here as part of our honeymoon road trip & honestly, words can’t even describe how incredible this cottage was! Every detail in the cottage itself, the vibe, and the beautiful farm animals right outside your window. The breakfast basket that was provided to us as well, was the cherry on top. This place is so special! 🤍 Definitely recommend!!"
4103,63,Mandy's stay was wonderful! My boyfriend and I stayed for a long weekend for hiking in the area. Her place was the perfect spot after a long day. The amenities were great and the cottage was beautiful. We loved the privacy but also the ease of getting into town. We loved the farm animals and their sweet dog. Mandy was great at communicating and very friendly. Would highly recommend staying here - I would love to come again!
4104,63,My boyfriend and I had a wonderful stay! We felt right at home and had everything we needed. Their dog was super cute and friendly too! Very cozy place!
4105,63,"We loved staying here and wish we could have stayed longer! It is a beautiful, cozy place that is unique- there is a farm right outside your window! The place has everything you need and is only 15 minutes from Morganton! We will definitely be coming back soon."
4106,63,Mandy’s place was beautiful and peaceful and all the animals were so friendly! Highly recommend this stay
4107,63,Great stay!
4108,63,"Just lovely! Perfect amount of space for my wife and I. We loved the farm fresh breakfast we could buy, and absolutely loved waking up to all of the animals. It was great to have two heat options as well!"
4109,63,"Thank you so much Mandy for providing such a beautiful and memorable stay, even for a short trip like ours! We loved the cozy cabin...it was just beautiful. We loved the quiet indoors but being able to see the animals just outside! We also loved the beautiful stars in the night sky with very little light pollution. Really, we enjoyed everything about this stay and can't recommend it strongly enough for anyone wanting a little cozy private romantic getaway in Morganton :)"
4110,63,"This is such magical, wonderful, beautiful place! We just stayed for the third time and every stay at Mandy’s cottage has been perfect. The setting is gorgeous: right next to the farm animals, with a gorgeous view of the cows and ponies and pigs from the well-appointed patio and the chickens and ducks waltz right by. The interior is also gorgeous, with comfy blankets and pillows, pretty art, and lots of windows to take in the view. The bed is super cozy and comfortable, the fireplace heater is romantic, and the shower is warm and lovely. The kitchen is well stocked and the breakfast basket makes for a wonderful start to the day. Plenty of coffee on hand (both a standard coffee maker and a keurig are on hand). The television is large and gets lots of channels if you can pull yourself away from the breathtaking view and the animals. Best of all, Mandy and Tyler (and their super sweet dog) are the loveliest, friendliest, most thoughtful hosts. We feel so lucky to get to stay here and can’t wait for trip number four!"
4111,63,"Great place to stay, breakfast basket was delicious and the views from the porch are great!"
4112,63,We absolutely LOVED staying here at Mandy‘s place. It was exactly as the pictures are shown and a little bit more. Their dog Maddie greeted us and was so cute the whole stay as she welcomed us each morning. From the farm fresh breakfast basket to the chickens running around outside of the place. It was amazing all the way around! I cannot wait to stay here again in the future!
4113,63,Amazing place to stay. Really peaceful and cute. Recommend.
4114,63,Lovely little piece of tranquility with great breakfast option. Wish I could have stayed longer.
4115,63,We had such a fun and relaxing weekend! We absolutely loved spending time with all of the animals. Everything was great - we’d love to come again!
4116,63,"Super cute cottage! Bed was very comfortable. We had trouble starting our fire in the pit and the host walked over and gave us some dry firewood, which caught right away. We ordered the breakfast basket and it was yummy."
4117,63,"The cutest farm, a short walk to the river, and the sweetest animals to watch as you have your morning coffee. We originally had a lot of hiking planned for our trip, but ended up wanting to stay on the farm to relax and enjoy the view haha.
I can’t recommend this place enough :)"
4118,63,"It was a great cabin with beautiful scenery! We only stayed one night so couldn’t explore the trail to the river but hopefully we can come back in the summer. This was a great space for 2 people, totally recommended!"
4119,63,"Beautiful and cozy stay! I texted Mandy with a few questions and she was very quick to respond and helpful. Was wonderful waking up in the morning and seeing all the cute animals out the window. Loved the fireplace heater and the games and décor. Was also so nice to be able to walk around a bit and say hi to the pigs and cows. One pig was so happy with some ear scratches that she laid down next to the fence for more pets <3 Highly recommend this place, if we're ever in the area we'll stay here again!"
4120,63,"If you don't know where to stay in Morganton, NC.....this is the place!!! Its quite, clean, and the family that owns the farm are great people. They make you feel at home. The animals are friendly. Don't forget to bring some sliced carrots for the donkey and the fuzzy cows!!! That's a great way to make friends with the animals. The cottage is clean and comfortable. The back patio is really relaxing and has a great view of the pasture and forest. The walk to the river is beautiful. We loved our week vacation there. OH.....and dont forget to get your farm fresh eggs from Mrs. Mandy."
4121,63,"Our stay was beyond perfect. It was such a dream arriving to the farm in the golden light of the afternoon with the pumpkin patch and corn maze to explore. We settled in and watched the cows and horses graze for a while, cooked dinner, and ate outside. We woke up to a peaceful morning and drank coffee outside greeted by chickens and a pup who loved to cuddle. Everything was just like the pictures, and even better in person! Such a cute and lovely little home, wish we could have stayed longer!"
4122,63,"My only regret was not having more time to relax on the farm! Was a lovely place to stay, very cute, cozy inside with some extremely comfortable bedding. Would come back in a heart beat!"
4123,63,My husband and I really enjoyed staying here as we were making are way from Michigan to Georgia for a wedding. They offered a very nice homegrown breakfast that we enjoyed while watching the animals have there breakfast as well.
4124,63,"There is nothing better than getting to an Air BnB with expectations, and having them BLOWN away! This place FAR exceeds any prior expectations you may have. The pictures do it no justice, and once you are actually there, the sights, smells, and animals immediately warm your heart and bring a smile to your face without you even knowing it has happened. More than gracious hosts. Amazing views. The perfect way to unplug, unwind, and get a real sense of actual relaxation. The best sleep we have had in months! It was so fun to cook our own breakfast basket, highly recommended. I could go on and on but I will end this with, if you haven’t visited Highland Farms, you are truly missing out on a diamond in the rough. Clean, cute, and more than affordable. Two thumbs way up! Can’t wait to see there adorable dog, Maddie again! 11/10 Stars!"
4125,63,"Beautifully curated. The house has just what you need in terms of basic needs. Loved that I was right next the farm with the chickens walking across the patio, definitely a farm stay. The view was perfect. Looking forward to another stay!"
4126,63,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Mandy’s cottage. She has put a lot of care and special touches into making it a lovely space to relax and leave worries behind. Our favorite part was being greeted by and watching all of the animals on the farm. We would definitely book a stay again in the future!
4127,63,We had a great stay at Henry River Farms! The covered patio provides a great place to hang out & have a meal with a view of the animals. The interior is well designed and most importantly - bed is comfortable! Would love to come back.
4128,63,"Don’t sleep on this place. It is so adorable and the community that they’ve created in the town is so beautiful. There are animals galore, a bottle of wine, a bathtub, and lots of non-tech fun to be had. Their hospitality is unrivaled and you need to click book rn."
4129,63,This is a fantastic place to stay. Just the perfect get away to unplug and relax. The animals made every so fun. There guard ducks as we called them were always very entertaining.
4130,63,"Loved being greeted by the farm animals- so fun.
We purchased the farm breakfast basket with ingredients right from location…so good!"
4131,63,"Cute place, friendly hosts, easy check in. It was fun seeing the farm animals in the morning. Hosts have an adorable dog too."
4132,63,What a beautiful Airbnb and location! Wish we could have stayed longer. Everything was clean and beautifully decorated. We enjoyed the farm environment and just watching the cows and chickens. It was a wonderful trip. Morganton is a cute town and we enjoyed the hiking at South Mountain! It was like opening a present…unexpected and fantastic!
4133,63,"Great experience, loved having the animals right outside. Ready to make another trip to do more exploring without the inclement weather! 10/10 recommend and will be back!"
4134,63,Very nice and beautiful place. Amazing stay.
4135,63,"Our favorite little getaway to disconnect from the everyday hustle and bustle of life and reconnect to nature and the beautiful animals on this farm.

Our second time booking this beautiful cottage and won’t be my last!

Mandy and her husband are such lovely people and no stone was left unturned in this little cottage. Truly a special place!"
4136,63,I can't think of a thing. We enjoyed our stay so much. We esp. loved Mattie. All the animals on the farm were so much fun to watch. I really loved momma cow. We will def plan to stay again.
4137,63,"We had such an amazing stay at the farm! Weve stayed in many and this is one of our most favorite BNB stays. The cottage was adorable, equipped with the needed essentials, and decorated lovely. It was so nice to sit on the porch rockers, watch the animals, relax by the Henry river and just enjoy nature and the peace. I can't say enough great things about the host, kids, and Maddy the family dog. We loved and miss our stay and will definitely be back!"
4138,63,"Mandy was wonderful to work with and her place is absolutely adorable! We only stopped to stay overnight on a road trip, but it was cozy and peaceful, with lots of thoughtful touches. Wish we could have stayed longer and would definitely stay here again!"
4139,63,"If you have ever fantasized about having a farm, this is the PERFECT place to stay. Every detail is well thought out and it was a lovely experience all the way around! Definitely get the breakfast basket - so delicious!!"
4140,63,The stay was absolutely amazing! Exactly as described in the posting. Mandy and Tyler were super sweet and responsive with anything we asked. Can’t wait to go back!
4141,63,"It was the perfect girls getaway for my cousin and I, who love animals and nature! We loved the breakfast basket and eating the meal in the rocking chairs with our coffee in the morning! We hope to be back!"
4142,63,A real working farm with beautiful cows and chickens and adorable puppy! We loved the relaxing feel and order the breakfast basket as well everything was great!
4143,63,If you are looking for a taste of small farm life or just peace and quiet this is it. The hosts are great and we had a wonderful stay.
4144,63,This space is super cool! Love the sliding door in the bathroom and the porch layout is beautiful! You can tell a lot of thought when into furnishing the space. I definitely would recommend the breakfast basket! It was farm fresh and a beautiful way to start our day!
4145,63,Fantastic little getaway! The farm was so peaceful and the chickens are very entertaining! Perfect spot to access downtown Morganton and the mountains. We will definitely be back!
4146,63,Very cute place. Animals right off the porch and the best covered space to enjoy the outdoors. Decor was perfect and just enough space for 2 people. Would definitely recommend
4147,63,Great relaxing weekend. Beautiful property and accommodations. Highly recommended staying.
4148,63,This place was exactly what we needed even for just one night. Just as described and had everything we needed and more. Definitely recommended getting the breakfast basket and what a great idea by the hosts. We just enjoyed sitting in the rockers and taking in the sights and sounds of the farm animals. Not too far from Morgantown if you wanted to grab dinner or bring it back and enjoy eating at the picnic table. We caught our breath and had a relaxing rest.
4149,63,"My husband and I selected Mandy and Tyler’s place to break up our trip home from Ohio back to Florida. We loved having the Scottish cows around and the overall laid back feeling after our trip. Mandy made it feel like home by having snacks available when we arrived, as well as the option to buy a home grown breakfast basket (we were able to make two meals out of it). They both also answered our messages within 30 min- hour. We did need to use our wifi in the car for our messages to send.

They have a quick little path down to the river on site - which Maddie the farm dog will lead you down to if she’s around! Downtown Morganton is about a 20 minute drive from the farm - being from the flat lands of Florida, we primarily drove during the day since the twists and turns of rural country roads were a little daunting.

Definitely check out Adventure Bound Books, Limbertwig Cafe, Moondog Pizza and Town Tavern. We also rode our Onewheels along the greenway near Town Tavern and at the new Valdese Park."
4150,63,Wonderful Airbnb with Creek and farm animals just what we wanted
4151,63,"What a wonderful peaceful place to get away from the cares of the world! I highly recommend this place for single travelers. Felt super safe and totally enjoyed the farm environment. The fridge, microwave, grill, firepit, and 2 burner stove with skillets and dishes, etc. made eating in with my groceries very easy and took away the need to go anywhere which allowed me to freedom to read, think, watch tv, draw, explore the area, etc. Totally would return. My favorite memories were the breakfast basket, my night using the fire pit, taking naps on the most comfortable bed, the antics of the farm animals, the sweet hostess and her family, the full moon, the porch at night lit up with patio lights and also when it rained sitting out on it with my cup of coffee listening to the rain hitting the tin roof. Hope other single travelers opt to explore this area which is 30 minutes from Lake James and also near where the Hunger Games was filmed."
4152,63,"Of the numerous airbnb’s Ive stayed in over the years, this one is a standout. The layout of the cottage is perfect. I loved the farm environment, so peaceful…and the hosts were , indeed, super! I can’t wait to go back."
4153,63,thank you
4154,63,"This AirBnB is one of the sweetest, most quaint places my husband and I have ever stayed. We will definitely be back!"
4155,63,"If you're looking for a nice, quiet stay smack dab on a working farm, this is the place! The host family is super nice and accommodating (right down to the fresh eggs from their chickens and sausage!). And the location is not far at all from a bunch of hiking and dining (downtown Morganton). We loved our stay and will be back!"
4156,63,Mandy and Tyler were wonderful hosts. We truly enjoyed our stay. It is a very charming place to stay.
4157,63,We had a great stay at the farmhouse! It was very clean and cute and the hosts thought of everything! It was super fun to see all the animals on the farm especially their adorable dog! The hosts were very friendly and responded immediately whenever we messaged them! They also have a great guide book and they even messaged us to let us know about an event going on in the area the weekend we were there! We would highly recommend staying there for a long weekend if you’re looking for a relaxing peaceful weekend!
4158,63,"Mandy and Tyler’s little farm house studio is charmingly decorated and it was a pleasure to stay there as a solo traveler, listening to the birds and occasionally to the chickens and cows each morning.

Nighttime was pin-drop quiet. Air conditioning worked great on my one warm night.

The house is quite remote so there is no reliable Wi-Fi, no TV and no T Mobile cellular or phone. It’s a 20 minute drive on twisting, shoulder-less two lane roads to any business.

However, I was able to drive about 10 minutes to find phone signal and 5G cellular data, pulling into someone’s driveway to make calls and answer texts. One night I found minimal signal just walking down the driveway.

The farm’s homemade sausage, available for purchase, is outstanding—you can buy just the sausage, and/or farm eggs or pork chops, all subject to availability.

If you don’t make breakfast plans you might regret it, as the nearest town’s breakfast offerings are extremely limited and not always good tasting, especially Sunday morning.

The small refrigerator can fit quite a lot, such as half gallon milk cartons. There’s no oven and no freezer, but there is a microwave and an ice maker that I did not use.

The double bed was super comfy and the outdoor patio is also very cozy. It even has ceiling fans!

All and all definitely recommended as a get-away-from-it-all, small farm vibe that is unusual and fun!"
4159,63,We had a very pleasant stay at the farm. It’s super relaxing to sit on the patio and to just watch the animals. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a fun trip!
4160,63,"Cute and comfortable cottage and outdoor space equipped with everything we needed for a peaceful and relaxing weekend. Beautiful property, easy to find and check-in, convenient to the grocery store and dining. Highly recommend and would love to stay here again!"
4161,63,I can’t say enough about this place. Absolutely perfect. It was hard to leave. A precious farm with a precious family and precious pup also :)
4162,63,"Great place to relax and enjoy a peaceful farm setting near the mountains. We enjoyed being right amongst the animals. A small indoor space feels much larger with the patio for eating and relaxing. Breakfast was delicious and South Mountains State Park was a short drive, where we could also spend much of the day. We'd come again!"
4163,63,"Beautiful little escape in the country. Peaceful to rock in the rocking chairs and look at the cows and fields. Not far to town. Fun to make a fire at night and see all the stars. (Remember, it's a farm, which comes with some bugs and smells. )"
4164,64,"Absolutely visiting again, the moment we pulled up to the opened door, it was peaceful. Everything you need and more. The enclosed porch to die for and the hanging chairs.. absolutely my favorite. I definitely fell asleep listening to nature. Do not pass this place up. We cannot thank Jennifer enough it's what we needed."
4165,64,So happy to read this Jessica :) That enclosed porch is pretty magical!!
4166,64,"Amazing rental and a responsive, thoughtful host! This cabin had beautiful scenery, tons of cute amenities (loved the fireplace & porch swings), and it felt very safe (while still being secluded in nature). It was super clean and we loved all of the cozy decor as well! I would 100% recommend to others and would visit again in the future ❤️"
4167,64,I'm so glad you enjoyed your stay and hope that you'll come back again soon :)
4168,64,Wonderful cabin everything was perfect. We would definitely come back.
4169,64,yay :) I'm so glad to hear this. Tell your friends to come visit too :)
4170,64,"I am a repeat stayer at this cabin, and there are about a million reasons why. The cabin’s personal touches, incredible comfortable bed, amenities, welcome tray with their own honey, and so much more. If you’re in the Murphy area, or anywhere near here, definitely stay here. Peaceful and relaxing and wonderful!"
4171,64,"Oh, this makes my heart truly sing :) Yay!! Come back again real soon and tell your friends too :)"

4173,64,I'm so glad Tara. Come again soon :)
4174,64,"My husband and I had a great stay at this cabin..it was beautiful, clean and we loved having the wonderful fireplace and huge smart TV. The cabin was decorated beautifully and adorable. There was a nice screened in porch as well. We would definitely stay again here."
4175,64,Yay :) I'm so glad you enjoyed your time at Fern Forest Cabin. Hope you're able to come visit again soon :)
4176,64,We loved staying at Jennifer’s place! The location was secluded enough and very peaceful. We enjoyed the quiet time to relax on our short vacation. We would definitely stay here again!
4177,64,I'm thrilled to hear that you had a good time. Come back again :)
4178,64,Such a cute cottage with everything u need already there including bath amenities and lots of cookware and basic seasonings. Jennifer was super kind and always responded right away with any questions we had. Provided us with recommendations around the area and cute crafts! Cabin was a little difficult to find. Such a beautiful place and definitely will stay here again!
4179,64,I'm so glad you enjoyed the cabin and hope you'll come back again soon :)
4180,64,"Our long weekend at Jennifer's cabin was awesome! Everything we needed was provided (and much, much more)! The cabin was one of the cleanest places we have every stayed in! We so enjoyed the restaurants, stores, and the beauty of God's creation in and around Murphy. We will recommend this special place to family and friends and look forward to returning in the future! Thanks, Jennifer, for making our stay so memorable!

David and Karen"

4184,64,"We loved this beautiful, quiet, peaceful and the location of this sweet cabin in the woods! If you are looking to get away from the stress of life or a romantic stay this is definitely your place to be! The entire cabin was well thought out and we loved the fireplace and screened porch but let’s not forget the restful sleep in this luxurious king size bed ! Comfortable and
Cozy was the theme! Jennifer added all those little special touches to our stay with her great assortment of good books, essential oil diffusers and a well stocked kitchen! We will definitely be back and never forget this special place in Fern Forest 🌳

4191,64,Awe :) This is wonderful! I hope you're able to come again real soon :)
4192,64,Jennifer's place was amazing! Truly a cozy and peaceful place to spend a weekend. Jennifer is also an amazing host. She is incredibly responsive and helpful. Couldn't recommend this place and the host enough.
4193,64,I'm so glad you enjoyed Fern Forest Cabin :) Hope you are able to come back again soon :)
4194,64,Beautiful wooded area but close to town. Beautifully furnished. Host is very proactive and provides info on local places to see and do. Would definitely stay again when in the area.
4195,64,I'm so glad you enjoyed your stay Terresa :) Hope you can come back again soon :)
4196,64,"We thoroughly enjoyed the stay, it was quite comfy cabin. It was snowing the day we went in, was so beautiful ! Drive way is little challenging but my subaru liked it , so
Am i. I think you should keep that drive way as is . We will surely visit again!"
4197,64,Yay! Having snow is so beautiful to see in the mountains :) Looking forward to welcoming you back!!

4201,64,Yay! I'm so glad you enjoyed your stay and look forward to welcoming you back again :) Happy New Year!
4202,64,Fern Forrest Cabin was more than we could have expected!! Everything was perfect and attention to detail was to perfection!! Would definitely love to stay there again!
4203,64,Yay! I'm so glad you enjoyed it and hope you're able to come back again real soon :)
4204,64,"My wife and I loved it!! Very private. I can see the appeal with the screened in porch for when warmer weather is around. Layout was nice. Made us start thinking that maybe we should build us one somewhere and I’d want it just like this one. Start to finish was great, communication wise, absolutely no issues. Cabin was exactly as promised. Even the locals were friendly. I actually enjoyed seeing the goats, cows, with their big white guard dog, and the turkeys as we were coming in and out of the cabin. We would stay there again, so that really sums it up!"
4205,64,Yay! I'm so glad you and your wife enjoyed Fern Forest Cabin :) Be sure to come back again soon.
4206,64,This was a peaceful and relaxing stay. Very tidy and lovely place equipped with everything you need. Jennifer was a great host. We had a great stay!
4207,64,Thank you so much Stephanie :) Please tell your friends about us!!
4208,64,Really enjoyed our stay here! Would be so happy to come back to this beautiful cabin. Thank you Jen!
4209,64,Fern Forest is truly a mountain oasis! The cabin has everything you need to relax (the screened porch was my happy place!) and lovely added touches by the owners. Would love to stay here again!
4210,64,I'm so glad you enjoyed your mountain oasis :) Please come back again soon!
4211,64,"My favorite little cabin in the woods… I will absolutely go back again. It was quiet, clean, and a great spot to unwind. The porch was perfect. Those hammock chairs are worth the price of admission alone! Murphy is a cute little town with extreme friendly people. Can’t wait till my next time."
4212,64,Oh I'm so glad to hear this April :) Please come back again real soon!
4213,64,"Beautiful cabin! Great location! Close enough, yet far enough away. Everything we needed to relax and enjoy a little escape. Jennifer goes above and beyond to ensure everyone feels home even while away from home. We loved the cozy bed, fireplace and screened in porch! We will definitely be back!"
4214,64,"I'm so glad you enjoyed this ""escape from reality"" Haha! Please come back again real soon Jennifer :)"
4215,64,This cabin is small but complete. Absolutely fantastic spot.
4216,64,I'm so glad you enjoyed the location and the amenities Marta :) Hope you're able to come visit again soon!
4217,64,"I loved everything about this cabin. I have visited Jeju Spa in Atlanta for a day getaway, however I think this is my new Self Care place to visit. This cabin was a spa inside the cabin. I used both aromatherapy diffusers all day, and the toiletry products was high quality. I sat in hammock swings drinking my coffee and listening to the rain fall. In my first Mommy/work free weekend in over ten years, I could have used a few more days. My whole stay I unplugged and worked on Krypt 736 piece puzzle. I did not complete the puzzle but enjoyed using my creative mind and the quiet of the cabin with only the Capiz chimes tinkling in the background. I recommended this place to several friends and they are highly interested in a getaway as well. Thank you so much!"
4218,64,This is wonderful Jenn :) Makes my heart sing reading this! I'm so glad you opened your creative mind and found relaxation. Please come again real soon!
4219,64,We had an excellent stay! The enclosed porch was great. We were able to spend time together outside and open the doors so that we could enjoy the fresh breeze throughout the house. The house is new construction.
4220,64,I'm so glad you enjoyed Fern Forest Cabin Ed :) Please come back again soon!!
4221,64,"This is the perfect couple's cabin for day trips to Tennessee, Georgia or North Carolina. We stayed a week and enjoyed every minute, especially Jennifer's lovely porch, comfy bed, quality towels and doTerra extras. The driveway is a steep one but there were no issues after the first day. Excellent communication."
4222,64,"Janine, I'm so glad you enjoyed your stay and the surrounding area :) It's such a beautiful area to explore!! Come back again soon :)"
4223,64,"Excellent place, clean, spacious and quiet area where the cabin is located. Definitely recommend staying here"
4224,64,Awesome! I'm so glad you enjoyed your stay Austin :) Come back again soon :)
4225,64,"Accommodations, amenities and extra small touches were perfect and made the trip even better. :)
-Cozy and quiet enough, I was able to slow down enough to finish a book that wasn’t for school.
-I went with my boyfriend, but cabin and area have a safe enough feel for solo traveler."
4226,64,"I'm so glad you enjoyed your stay Savannah :) AND, that you read a book that wasn't for school! You must feel so relaxed :) Come back again soon."
4227,64,"Another great stay in one of her AirBnbs! Thank you for the Mexican restaurant recommendation; it was delicious! And, even if you don’t have kids, definitely check out the craft drawer… a lot of fun activities for everyone! This cabin was perfect for our fall getaway in the mountains! It’s clean, quiet and convenient to several neighboring areas that we enjoy visiting. Thank you for a comfortable place to call home for a few days!"
4228,64,Love our repeat guests!! Please be sure to book your next stay...maybe the holidays perhaps??
4229,64,Awesome
4230,64,I'm so glad you enjoyed your stay :) Be sure to come back again soon!!
4231,64,"Jennifer's cabin was such a refreshing time! the cabin was super clean, easy to find and super enjoyable!"
4232,64,Amazing!
4233,64,"Yay!! I'm so glad you enjoyed your stay Brandon :) Be sure to tell your friends...or better yet, bring one or two of them with you next time!!"
4234,64,"If you're looking for a cozy place to unwind, this is it. My husband and I enjoyed an anniversary weekend here and it was a great space to hang out together. We came with plans to use the grill and the fire pit but once we got there we never made it past the porch. The weather was almost perfect so we had the double doors open all weekend. The lighting options were great. An amber colored lamp in each room as well as some bright lights too depending on what you need. It was a bummer it wasn't cool enough to use the fireplace of an evening because that would have been perfect. The dishwasher was also very convenient! It was nice not having to spend all that time washing dishes. There are lots of little treasures to find at Fern Forest Cabin. It would be a shame if I shared them all."
4235,64,"Lindsay, I'm so glad you enjoyed the special touches at Fern Forest Cabin...more importantly, that you had a relaxing stay. I've curated my cabins to help restore our guests body, mind and spirit :) I hope you're able to visit again soon and next time you may want to try out our other cabin, Forest Therapy...also in Murphy, NC."
4236,64,Perfect romantic getaway. The cabin was clean and well provisioned. There were many highlights but the best was sitting a foot away from the hummingbird feeder when one came up to feed. What relaxing long weekend!
4237,64,I'm so glad you enjoyed yourselves :) Those hummingbirds are so wonderful to watch :)
4238,64,Our stay was absolutely wonderful! The cabin was so beautiful and clean and the little touches of fall that were added just made the space feel even more like home. The location was great and my favorite part was probably the swing chairs on the screened in back porch. I am prone to be attacked by mosquitoes So I enjoyed the fact that it was screened it. Would definitely love to stay again!
4239,64,"I love that you enjoyed the swing chairs!! Those are definitely favorites for many :) AND, we kept you safe from those mosquitoes inside the screened in porch. I hope you come back again real soon!!"
4240,64,"We enjoyed our stay here but I was expecting it to be a bit cleaner. The cleaner forgot to clean under the bed and it was dirty, the air filter was pretty dirty and there was mold on the shower curtain liner. The driveway is interesting and very rough. My husband is in construction and was scratching his head at it all weekend. We were going to pull out the couch bed to enjoy a movie but it wouldn’t open. But no big deal.
I love all the ideas of things to do in the area. We went brasstown bald on the drive there and Anna ruby falls the next day. Highly recommend both. We just drove through Helen as we aren’t into tourist towns. They are all the same. Loved the screen porch and would sit outside with our coffee listening to the rain. Bed was pretty comfortable. We did not use the grill but enjoyed the fire pit. There are plenty of games and books although we didn’t use those. There are a few oils and toiletries to try but we didn’t try those either. They were a nice touch. I would recommend this place if someone was looking to stay in this area."
4241,64,Thank you for telling me about the cleanliness under the bed and air filter...we got that taken care of right away!! We always want to have 5 star cleanliness for our cabins and appreciate all feedback from our guests :) We also have fixed the pullout sleeper sofa...thank you again for letting us know. The previous guest did use it and had not mentioned any issues so we do appreciate you letting us know so that we could get it fixed immediately :) I'm so glad you enjoyed the amenities and your time on the porch and around the fire pit. I hope you'll come again soon!!
4242,64,"This is a perfect place for a retreat. The cabin is well stocked, it has everything one might need . Jennifer is an amazing, responsive, and welcoming host, she takes very good care of her place and you can tell at the very first moment you walk in."
4243,64,Thank you so much Esam :) I'm so glad you enjoyed your stay and hope you come back again soon!!
4244,64,"What a wonderful stay! My daughter's and I loved so much about this cabin. the aroma therapy, the clean beautiful space, the excellent hosting and most of all the porch!!"
4245,64,I'm so glad you enjoyed your time away at Fern Forest Cabin :) Come back again soon!!
4246,64,We absolutely loved this cabin. The location was perfect for us. We took daily trips to different hikes and to Helen and Asheville. There are amenities everywhere. Our favorite part was the seclusion from everyday life. The Doterra products everywhere was awesome too!
4247,64,I'm so glad you were able to enjoy and explore this area of the country :) It truly is beautiful! Be sure to tell all of your friends and we hope to see you back soon :)
4248,64,"This was a wonderful cabin. Perfect for a mountain getaway.
Jennifer was a great host, very accommodating and quick to respond."
4249,64,I'm thrilled that you enjoyed your time at the cabin :) Be sure to come back soon!!
4250,64,"The place was absolutely beautiful and was exactly what I needed to relax. The atmosphere is very cozy and tranquil with a lot of personal touches that makes the location even more inviting! The host is extremely helpful and responsive. I also loved the overall holistic and interactive activities in the cabin with aromatherapy, games, books, and even the option of purchasing a self care book. Definitely would recommend!"
4251,64,I'm so glad you enjoyed your time Michelle and were able to unplug :) Be sure to tell your friends and come back again soon :)
4252,64,"I don’t even know where to get started with this review! Let me just say this the BEST Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in!!! The SOFTEST bed, the most comfortable living room, the porch that you could spend entire days hanging out on. The absolutely adorable special touches and amenities. I highly highly highly recommend you stay here. I am booking my next stay in here within a couple weeks!"
4253,64,"Micki, I'm so glad you enjoyed your stay so much!! Can't wait for you to come back again soon :)"
4254,64,"Very clean, well stocked and relaxing cabin!! Owner was super communicative and accommodating! Highly recommend to anyone wanting a relaxing getaway, or someone wanting more adventure as it's close to lots of things to do too!!"
4255,64,I'm so glad you enjoyed the cabin and it's amenities :) Come back again soon!
4256,64,"The home is very nice and I like the decor. In the back, there is a table for you to enjoy your breakfast in the mornings. When we would come back from our hikes, we would use the aromatherapies. I liked staying here because it allowed us to explore different trails within Georgia and North Carolina. Last, Jennifer has yoga mats available for you to use. The home had everything we needed."
4257,64,I'm so glad you enjoyed the cabin and all of the amenities :) Be sure to plan a trip back and tell your friends too :)
4258,64,"Such a lovely place and so clean! We wanted a peaceful weekend getaway and this is the perfect place! The aromatherapy is a plus to the relaxation as well, really enjoyed it. And Jennifer is such a great host, always keeping us updated! Thank you so much!"
4259,64,Yay! I'm so glad it was the peaceful getaway that you wanted Maria :) Please come back again soon!!
4260,64,"Fern Forest Cabin is such a relaxing stay! The view from the porch feel as though you are in the trees, and the smell of cedar welcomes you back into the cabin. We loved our stay and want to go back again for a forest retreat soon."
4261,64,I'm so glad you enjoyed your experience at Fern Forest Cabin :) Tell all of your friends and family...hope to welcome you back again soon!!
4262,64,"This is my second time staying at Jennifer’s Cabin while traveling for business. It is quiet, peaceful and very well-stocked with kitchenware, books and activities. I loved that she has some nice bath products and essential oils to try. Loved the screened in porch and the fireplace!"
4263,64,"Aubri, I'm so thrilled you find solace at Fern Forest Cabin...and, can keep your work going. That's the best of both worlds right?! Next time you come back the driveway will be much improved :) Concrete gets poured later this week."
4264,64,This place was splendid! We had everything we needed to prepare all of our meals and Jennifer was very responsive to us. Until next time! Thanks for everything!!!🎖🎖🎖🎖🎖
4265,64,I'm so glad you enjoyed the Fern Forest Cabin John :) Come back again soon!!
4266,64,This was a really nice and relaxing place to stay! Bed is comfortable the living areas are very clean and comfortable and the porch is great. Only thing to look out for is the driveway is very steep and our car wasn’t able to make it up to the cabin. It not a long walk at all but very steep so if that is an issue for you i would be cautious. Otherwise it’s a great place to stay.
4267,64,"I'm so glad you had a relaxing time away AND had a good night's sleep :) Yes, that driveway is finally going to be concreted in just 2 weeks. We'll be so happy to have that done :)"
4268,64,"A great cabin and mountain experience. Jennifer has stocked the retreat with everything you could possibly need...soft blankets and pillows, luxury bath products and diffusers, and modern conveniences. Loved the gas stove and massive TV!. All of this in a peaceful setting with an amazing porch. Highly recommend it. The only issue was the steep driveway as others have mentioned. We just parked at the bottom without any issue whatsoever. Didn't bother us at all. Would be happy to stay there again."
4269,64,"I'm so glad you enjoyed the amenities, furnishing and the cabin overall. Yes, we are so excited to get the driveway concreted so that it's not an issue with any of our guests in the future. This will be completed by Memorial Day weekend this year, 2022 :) Just a month away from now."
4270,64,"This cabin had all everything you could possibly need to have a very comfortable stay. We really enjoyed the hummingbird feeder, the patio swings, the fireplace, the essential oil diffusers, and the super comfortable bed!

The driveway is a slight challenge, but we got up it in my 2 wheel drive Honda CRV every attempt without issue."
4271,64,"I'm so glad you enjoyed your stay Jettero :) We'll be getting that driveway fixed permanently in mid May, just a few short weeks away from now. Rather than continuing to put gravel on the top which continues to wash away. It will be a concrete driveway that is long-lasting :) Come back again soon so you can see it!!"
4272,64,"This is one of the best airbnbs I’ve stayed in. I highly recommend it. The driveway is not a problem as others have stated; it is well graveled and I made it fine in my Honda Civic. The cabin is clean and nicely furnished and the bed is very comfortable. The shower was sparkling clean and nicely hot. It is a peaceful space and although you can see other cabins, it feels very private. Be aware you need to bring your own firewood. Once you’re here, you won’t want to leave!"
4273,64,I'm so glad you were able to find some peace at our cabin in the mountains and thank you for the glowing review :) Please come back soon Ruth!!
4274,65,East Carolina beach long weekend
4275,65,"We had a great experience, and Adam was very responsive. The house was clean and we all had a great time."
4276,65,"This is our second visit to this beach cottage with our 2 dogs. Beautiful renovations, comfortable home-like feeling and so close to the beach! We had some minor issues with check-in and Internet power outage, but they were resolved almost immediately. Look forward to coming back later this year!"
4277,65,Perfect location. Quaint home. Steps to the beach.
4278,65,"Great place, great back yard for dogs. Will stay here again! Absolutely no complaints!!!!"
4279,65,"Overall place was a good value, with the exception of coffee maker not working the next morning. Host appreciated the comment and is replacing it."
4280,65,"Wonderful place, super clean, very comfortable beds, great location, walking distance to the beach and restaurants. Great amenities. It was 5 of us and more then enough room for everyone. Highly recommend this place."
4281,65,"The place was cute. The floors were a bit sandy when we arrived. We only used one of the bedrooms and found the bed to be comfortable. There were lavender air fresheners in every room, with some having more than one...they were very overpowering and triggered my allergies. Shower is very small and sprays like a hose directly out of the shower if you open the shower door, only way to get around that is to be in the shower when you first turn it on resulting in standing in cold water until it warms up. Rules state to strip beds and put linens and towels in laundry and start it...I also learned (after I arrived home) you also asked to take out the garage...what did I pay a $175 cleaning fee for?? There was no storage space in the bedrooms except for small closets, one was locked. I would suggest a dresser or at least some luggage racks so you aren't forced to put luggage on the floor for your entire stay."
4282,65,"Hey Heather, thank you for booking your stay with us! Considering our proximity to the beach we hope you understand sand is common. We have staff around the clock that also live on the island that can assist, we wish you would’ve let us know of anything beforehand. We will take in your feedback to try and have a more accommodating property."
4283,65,"This house was perfect for our family and dog! The house was very well maintained and had lots of little extras that made the visit great - travel size soaps, beach toys, wine opener :) Walkability and distance from the beach could not have been better! We were able to easily come and go with two little kids. Check-in was super easy and Adam always responded immediately to any of our questions. Will definitely visit again."
4284,65,Thanks for our great stay. We really enjoyed the short weekend getaway.
4285,65,Loved this place. Would stay there again and recommend it to others.
4286,65,"The house was beautiful; just as expected based on the pictures. The beach entrance was so close, and easily walkable with 2, 6 and 7 year old kids. The house was comfortable (nice beds and ceiling fans) and perfect for 2 adults and 3 kids! We didn’t bring our dog this time but the back yard looked perfect for our pup to join next time. Adam was very proactive in his communications. Highly recommend this house and look forward to staying here again."
4287,65,What a gem of a find and a fantastic value. Thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this little spot which was far roomier than the pictures made it appear. Although I did not need all of the beds the fenced in back yard and well kept property made things so easy. A couple hundred yards and I was on the sand and when things settle down for the evening you can sit out front and listen to the rhythm of the waves. On Super Bowl Sunday I discovered the property was absent of decent knives and although prepared to make do I was pleasantly surprised that Adam’s crew took the time to bring me what I needed. I will not hesitate to return.
4288,65,Adam’s cottage was perfect. We truly enjoyed the stay. Being able to have to dogs with us was perfect. We will be back.
4289,65,Great location
4290,65,"This cottage was everything we wanted in our beach vacation. So relaxing and comfortable and the close beach access was amazing. The best part was being able to bring our two Labs with us because of the large fenced in yard. We appreciate the one level with no large flights of stairs to climb. It was the perfect size for me, my husband and Lab girls. Adam was very responsive to all needs and questions during our stay. We will definitely plan on returning next year!"
4291,65,We had a great time staying at The Good Life. The location was perfect for accessing the beach--right next to a public beach access. And it's only a few blocks down the road from Freeman Park were dogs can be off-leash on the beach. Will definitely rebook in years to come.
4292,65,Adam’s house is exactly as shown. It was perfect for a week at the beach. So close to the ocean. I hope to be back soon!
4293,65,Super cute place! Very close to the beach access. Love that we were able to take our dogs and I really appreciate that there were not tons of breakable things that I had to move out of kids reach. We will definitely be back!
4294,65,"My fiancé, golden retriever and I all had a great stay at this little house just off the beach! We loved the fact that there was a yard, even if it did flood from high tides (and Adam was kind enough to give us a discount because of that). You could fit quite a few more people in than we did. All in all, great spot for a few days away!"
4295,65,Awesome location! Hope we can make it back again soon!
4296,65,Great location just steps to the beach! Would stay again for sure. Prompt communication and easy check in. Thanks Adam
4297,65,"Adams place was a perfect getaway, super clean and just like the pictures. One bed had a foam topper which was super comfortable. Very convenient location!"
4298,65,"We had a wonderful stay at this coastal cottage! It is in a perfect location—my two toddlers were able to walk to the beach without any complaints! It was clean, had great A/C, plenty of parking, and felt very safe. It was priced well and made for a great family vacation!"
4299,65,"My stay was absolutely Wonderful. Perfect charming home, doggy friendly, great location. I look forward to booking here in the future."
4300,65,"What a great stay! The location was absolutely perfect!!! Literally around the corner from the beach! We appreciated the fact that it was in a less crowded area of Carolina Beach, the beaches never felt too packed although farther down they definitely were.

We loved that it was a stand alone house, having a house all to ourselves was great. We also appreciated the outdoor shower, the washing machine and the kitchen with essentials.

The house was so clean and the bedrooms were very comfortable. Check in was so easy too! The front porch chairs made for an enjoyable sit in the mornings and the back yard was so big. It really was the perfect stay for our trip to Carolina Beach! Would absolutely return!"
4301,65,Seamless check in. Great communication. Across the street from a beach access. Furniture was new but not super comfortable. Would definitely stay again.
4302,65,I enjoyed my stay there and it's was just as advertised.
4303,65,Adam and his team were very nice and quick to respond. Will definitely come back
4304,65,"We had a great stay and would love to stay again. The house was adorable, very clean and comfortable. And so close to the beach! It was a only a couple minute walk - across the street and 2 houses down. Adam communicated well about the booking and had staff on the island if we needed anything - but everything was perfect, and we had no need to do so. Looking forward to staying again."
4305,65,"Great place, clean and great location."
4306,65,"A gem of a coastal cottage not a block away from beach access. Stand alone building a must for nostalgic late night dance parties. Walkable to pier or Sea Witch. Fenced in yard for fur babies. [Please pick up your poo!] Outdoor shower great for humans & pugs. An awesome girls' weekend was had by all! We will be looking to book again. Thanks, Adam!"
4307,65,"Adam is Amazing, professional, and so responsive and accommodating! We will be renting from him again! Thank you so much!"
4308,65,"Great location, perfect beach cottage! Literally across the street from beach access!"
4309,65,Great place to stay if you’re ever in Carolina Beach. We loved the close proximity of the beach and local restaurants. Adam was a great host.
4310,65,Wonderful home and amazing location! Nice and close to the beach. We appreciated the outdoor shower and fenced yard for our pup! The kitchen was pleasantly well equipped. Everything we needed! We had a great stay - thank you!
4311,65,"The place was very cute and cozy!! The house was super clean also, plus it is very close to beach access! Thank you so much Adam for letting us stay at your amazing cottage!"
4312,65,thank you Macy y'all were a pleasure to host & we cannot wait to host y'all again hopefully in the near future! Cheers & happy 4th of July!!
4313,65,Great house and great location!
4314,65,Thank you so much for your kind words Kaela! We hope y'all come back & visit the good life again soon!
4315,65,Awesome place just one row off the beach! Perfect for a couples weekend or small family. Definitely will try to come back.
4316,65,"Kevin, thank you so much for this review! We hope you come back & visit us soon! Glad you enjoyed your stay my friend. Cheers"
4317,65,"OMG yessss! From Communication, accomodations, proximity, and simple check-in and lack of weird overbearing host situation!

This Airbnb was amazeballs! Everything is Amazingly convenient and made it easy for this single mom of 3 to zip in and out and get the beach time, boardwalk fun and doggy backyard time we wanted for our country pups!!

Thanks so much for the thoughtful touches, like shampoo/conditioner and soap! Especially since it was the one thing I forgot to pack!

You're an amazing host and if and when we go back, would love to book again!"
4318,65,"I think this maybe the most amazeballs review we have received thus far! Michelle, we are grateful you came & were able to experience the good life, we are so thankful for this review as well. Please come back & visit again soon!"
4319,65,Great place! Very clean and close to beach. Had some trouble with the key pad entry but host was quick to respond and resolve the issue immediately. Would definitely stay again.
4320,65,"Thank you Blaire, we hope y'all visit us again soon(:"
4321,65,This is a great spot!!!
4322,65,"Thank you Susan, we had a pleasure hosting(: Come back & visit soon!"
4323,65,"The Good Life is exactly what I was looking for. The highlight being that from front door to beachfront was no more than a 60 second walk. The beach seemed to be limited mainly to other renters nearby, which prevented it from getting crowded. The house itself was awesome. Comfy nights sleep, clean bathroom and kitchen, and a nice backyard too hang out outside on the property. Overall we had an incredible stay at The Good Life and would happily book again!"
4324,65,"Greg, thank you my friend for this generous review. You were a pleasure to host & would love for you & your group to visit us again soon(:"
4325,65,"We had an outstanding experience at Adam’s Airbnb. The host was extremely responsive and made check-in very smooth and easy. The house is clean, smells good, and the beds are so comfortable. The proximity to the public access beach was even closer than I imagined. My family of 5 couldn’t have asked for a better home base while we adventured around Carolina Beach; it truly enhanced make our mini vacation!"
4326,65,"Thank you Danielle!! We hope you & the family come & visit us again soon, y'all are welcome with open arms! Thank you again so much!"
4327,66,The perfect place to stay to be right on the boardwalk with beach access!
4328,66,"This was the perfect spot to stay at the beach! Everything was within walking distance and convenient, and the view of the ocean when waking up was just the best. Highly recommend and would stay again!!"
4329,66,"Vanesa’s property was beautiful and in a great location! It was clean, had a full kitchen, and was plenty of room for our family of 4 with the one bedroom and pullout couch. Parking was conveniently located as well and Vanesa was very responsive. There are no mirrors to exit the parking lot so you can’t see the sidewalk and if people are coming so just be careful exiting. This would be an update the builder or city would have to make. Overall, this was a great place to stay and is our number 1 pick to stay at in the future!"
4330,66,"This was my 2nd time staying at TownePlace Condominiums with Vanessa. The location and its host are wonderful. The bed and the coach in Unit 402 were not good, and my prior unit, the coach, was not good. Unfortunately, these drawbacks would make me consider other options when visiting Carolina Beach."
4331,66,"The description can’t capture the beauty of this unit. The view is breathtaking and the location is absolutely amazing. Host was terrific.

Minor feedback:
- would have loved a tv in the bedroom
- no wall outlets in bedroom for chargers

Otherwise, this was a wonderful experience and I will definitely book again!

Pics just don’t do this place justice. I LOVE IT!!!"
4332,66,Absolutely lovely stay! Lots of great restaurants within walking distance. Beach was a short walk away and had a nice view from the balcony! Parking was nice too! Would definitely stay again!
4333,66,Great stay …. Will be booking again .. would love a TV in the bedroom….
4334,66,It was a great staycation location. I will definitely be back.
4335,66,Great location and great view… Would rent again 👍🏾
4336,66,"House was the same as described. Easy to find, clear instructions, and super clean. We loved that the house had a beach view. Perfect for sunrise lovers. Would definitely love to stay there again."
4337,66,"Vanesa's condo is gorgeous! Spectacular view of the beach and boardwalk. It was very clean, artfully decorated and comfortable. It's a quick walk to the beach! We had a delightful stay, and enjoyed eating at Havana's across the street, and Fork n' Cork downstairs. We also drove to Wilmington and enjoyed Blueberry's Grill and the Famous Toastery for breakfast. Only recommendations are flipping the mattress (bed was a little sunken in) and clearer instructions on how to use the AC/Heating system."
4338,66,"Location couldn’t be more perfect. Even though it’s right at the entrance to the boardwalk and life of Carolina Beach, it was quiet. The place is a lot bigger and nicer than the photos suggested so I was pleasantly surprised. There was a hiccup with the cleaning and some linens/towels but Vanesa was good about responding. I used the kitchen for my meals and was able to cook as I would at home. Designated parking spot was great and I used the app to get in and out of the place which was convenient."
4339,66,place was amazing! please visit it!
4340,66,Great location to boardwalk-shopping and restaurants. Amazing views. Pictures do not do it justice
4341,66,Vanessa's place was an excellent find. I am a host and travel often so have many stays to compare it to. I can say this was definitely a 5 star stay. It is a great value with a perfect beach location. The view of the ocean is completely unobstructed. It is a well furnished and comfortable space with everything needed for a short or longer stay. Strong WIFI and streaming services available. The area is completely walkable and beach access is easy. There are several restaurants below the complex and others within a very short walk. There is onsite parking and an elevator. Check in and check out are very easy. I would stay here again and absolutely recommend.
4342,66,Great place to stay. The tall ceilings and beautiful decor was amazing. Very clean and modern. Also loved the balcony and the door leading to it. Felt like home but newer.
4343,66,Beautiful accommodations. Vanesa was great. Proactively reached out to let us know we could check in early if we wished. Also provided parking hours before check in. Just overall very considerate and her hospitality equated to a wonderful stay.
4344,66,Perfect place for a little beach vacay. Lovedthe ocean view from the private 4th floor balcony and being able to walk right downstairs for lunch. Vanesa was a very responsive host as well.
4345,66,Condo is beautiful!! Had everything we needed. Very comfortable bed. Had the right supplies in kitchen. We were able to cook a dinner without trouble. Beautiful view!! Would definitely go back!!
4346,66,"The location was great. It was an easy drive to downtown Wilmington, and Fort Fisher. There is a lot to do in the area. There are several good restaurants within walking distance.
The condo is ideal for 2 people. It was clean and neat. The parking was convenient and secure."
4347,66,Great location! Top floor gives you beautiful Atlantic Ocean views and sunrises. Very walkable due to the location in Carolina Beach. Very clean and spacious for a 1 bedroom condo. Checkin was great. I was able to use my phone as the key. All in all I would definitely book this place again!
4348,66,Everything was perfect. The place was clean and beautiful. We couldn’t have asked for a better location. So many restaurants within walking distance and really close to the boardwalk. Excellent experience! Would recommend to everyone.
4349,66,This property is convenient to everything. Walking distance from the ocean. Vanesa was very responsive and a GREAT host.
4350,66,Great condo right in the heart of Carolina Beach....walking distance to just about everything!!
4351,66,Great place to ring in the New Year!
4352,66,Would love to stay again!
4353,66,Great place within walking distance to everything in Carolina Beach. Clean and view and balcony are nice. I would recommend.
4354,66,"Very tidy and homey, my friends and I very much enjoyed our stay"
4355,66,"Wow!!! Stay here! What a great place, spectacular views of the ocean, a giant ferris wheel , clean, new and comfortable with loads of amenities, great pizza and food right across the street! Close to everything!"
4356,66,"Second time staying here, it’s a wonderful location! I walked into the rental and it had not been cleaned so I was confused, but Vanesa was very responsive and quickly made things right, I was able to move into the unit just below me. Crisis averted, and no sacrifices made. And she refunded my cleaning fee. Appreciate how smoothly things went despite the snafu! Will not stop me from renting again, these places are beautiful and very accommodating!"
4357,66,"Perfect! Well-stocked, nicely decorated, clean home with a comfortable bed, in an excellent location. The included parking is a huge plus for this area, and you’re a very! close walk to restaurants, shops, the boardwalk and, most importantly, the beautiful beach."
4358,66,"Beautiful place, well equipped, would definitely recommend. Looking forward to staying again."
4359,66,We had a wonderful stay. This was our 2nd time staying at one of Vanesa’s listings. The location is perfect. Would definitely stay again.
4360,66,It was disappointing that no TV was in the bedroom and no wifi but over all the places very clean very nice great location.
4361,66,"Hi Raethan! We do have wifi available for our guests, we have it shared under the listing details ""Info for Guests""> ""Wifi"". Next time please reach out via message during your stay and we'll be happy to provide that info, thanks!"
4362,66,"Great condo! Clean, great view, excellent location. Great communication with the host."
4363,66,"Great place, would definitely stay again."
4364,66,We were pleasantly surprised at the awesome view (especially on a full moon night). It was very fun to sit in our balcony and watch the Ferris wheel. The noise and excitement were barely audible inside at all. The place was super clean and a great getaway (last minute) for my husband and my anniversary. I would return.
4365,66,"We look for and expect pristine and comfy spaces when traveling, and this condo did not disappoint! It had all the essentials we appreciate and you can not beat the location! Communication with Vanessa was good as well. Do not hesitate to book this space!"
4366,66,"We had some plans fall through and we booked with Vanesa very last minute, she was extremely helpful and thankfully check in was very convenient especially given our timeframe that we were on. The place was extensively cleaned and looked brand new. There was a nice view and it was in a great location within walking distance from quite a bit of options. Perfect place for a couple looking to get away for a while. Definitely coming back."
4367,66,"Excellent location and condo! We had a great time, thanks!!"
4368,66,Our stay at Vanesa's condo was really spectacular!!! The view alone is worth the trip!! The condo is located RIGHT next to the boardwalk and ocean and the view from the condo shows both beautifully! I found myself just staring out the windows and sitting on the balcony at the wonderful view. Vanesa was great with communication and responded to any questions we had quickly. Would definitely recommend and stay here again!
4369,66,"This was our 2nd time staying, very clean , and definitely recommend this very clean and great location stay!!!!"
4370,66,"Amazing views, close to everything, perfectly accommodated."
4371,66,"Lovely place, lovely view. Great kitchen. Feels spacious and comfortable though one bed/one bath, even for 3 adults. Immaculate. Convenient fun location! We had a wonderful time!"
4372,66,Great location and a great value. the view is amazing.
4373,66,Great location! We will definitely be booking again!
4374,66,Our family enjoyed our stay here - so much natural light and a nice view of the boardwalk and ocean. It is within walking distance to everything you need! Very clean comfortable!
4375,66,"Simply amazing!! The pictures and description of this condo cannot do it justice. It is absolutely stunning on the inside with gorgeous high ceilings and beautiful windows that overlook the ocean and the heart of Carolina Beach!! We parked our car and I did not have to use it again until we left, which was amazing. It is walking distance to absolutely everything that Carolina Beach has to offer. The amenities are perfect – I did not cook much but everything I needed was there. We cannot wait to rent this place again!"
4376,66,"such a great place! location couldn't be better as we walked most everywhere for meals, coffee and wine. having an ocean view, carnival lights and music made the trip so special! Will definitely book again!"
4377,66,"Great location in the middle of everything! The view of the amusements and the beach were really nice at all hours. Despite being right there with all the rides, the condo was really quiet. Walkable to beach, restaurants and shops."
4378,66,Lovely location
4379,66,"We really enjoyed our stay, couldn’t have asked for a better location and view!"
4380,66,Excellent location ! Everything was easily accessible. The condo was exactly as pictured. Hosts had great communication with clear instructions and information.
4381,66,Really great location!
4382,66,We had a great time at this property. The location is right beside the boardwalk area of Carolina Beach so it is a short walk to many different points of interest. The apartment was very clean and has a great view of the ocean and amusement rides area. The apartment had everything we needed. I would definitely come again.
4383,66,"This is a gem of a spot right in the heart of Carolina Beach. Decorated lovely and has all you need. The best part of this condo is the beautiful windows and porch that overlook the beach and boardwalk, you can sit for hours!!! Host was quick to respond if you needed her. This condo has TONS of cute coffee shops, restaurants and bars close by all with in walking distance. We pretty much parked our car and walked everywhere.
Look forward to visiting again one day."

4393,66,Great condo very close to the livelihood of Carolina Beach. Clean and large for 2 people! Great weekend!
4394,66,"Absolutely amazing!

We have visited many beaches in North and South Carolina.

So far, Carolina Beach is the winner! Family oriented, close knit, beautiful ocean & oceanfront. Last but not least, this condo.

This place is literally in the perfect spot. From its prime location to the many times we sat on the patio. The quick walk & easy access to the beach was the cherry on top!

It is simply pure perfection!!!

We couldn’t have selected a better beach or a better condo to spend our summer vacation. We will most definitely be returning in the very near future!!!

4398,66,"We were super happy here! The condo is very clean and new. Panoramic view of the ocean. The balcony overlooks a delightful, bustling boardwalk amusement park. Beach is a block away."
4399,66,"Nice, clean condo. Location can't be beat- having a free parking space right off the beach and walking distance to restaurants made our trip so easy. Beautiful view."

4415,66,"We absolutely lived our visit to Carolina Beach. My good friend/business partner wanted to get away for a girls trip to check out some local places for inspiration and to recharge from the craziness of business and work. Wilmington/ Carolina Beach didn’t disappoint. We loved the Condo we stayed at - so cute, pictures do it justice. Pretty view! Loved the convenience. Drive to Wilmington totally worth it to stay close to the beach. The Host was super nice and straight forward. Can’t wait to come back again! If you visit the area - don’t hesitate to stay here. Also If you are a foodie - do the taste of Carolina food tour in Wilmington!"
4416,66,Great place and is super close to the beach. We will definitely be back again!
4417,66,"Great view, super clean and feels like a home!"
4418,66,"Incredible location in CB.. in the thick of it all. Walking distance to several great restaurants, the boardwalk, and a coffee shop and restaurant on the first floor. Fantastic sunrises.

Personally, I enjoyed the off-season quiet, and I suspect it gets hopping in season.

Clean place, Great instructions, private parking. If in CB again, would definitely consider it!"
4419,66,"Great location, Clean, Well Decorated, and Easily Accessible as Described by Check-in Instructions."
4420,66,"Gorgeous and comfortable. Perfect location with amazing views, and the hostess was very helpful. Highly recommend , 5 star plus!!!"
4421,66,Really nice little place! Everything was very clean and we liked the openness of the common area and the view. The location is excellent to just walk anywhere for food/beach etc.
4422,66,Convenient location - great views! Clean and well stocked.
4423,66,"The condo is modern and immaculate. It is the perfect size for a couple or very small family. The open layout makes it a very comfortable place to hang out and enjoy the gorgeous views of the ocean. The bed is very comfortable, and the kitchen and bathroom are modern and beautiful. Vanesa is the perfect host and responded quickly. The best part of this condo is the location. It sits over a nice restaurant, is right across the street from the boardwalk, and is less than a mile from a nice Publix. You can enjoy the beach from the balcony or walk across the street and enjoy the boardwalk and the beach. We had a phenomenal weekend in Vanesa's beautiful condo."
4424,66,thank you so much everything worked out perfectly
4425,66,"This was a great stay! Beautiful views, perfect location to walk to all restaurants, beach and there was a convenience store to get all your needs right across the street."
4426,66,"Light, bright, airy. Great location for easy access to boardwalk and beach. I’d be happy waking up to that intoxicating ocean view every day. Wowza! Also enjoyed the mini balcony for coffee at sunrise. Thx for a great stay, Vanesa!"
4427,66,Great location and amazing views.
4428,66,"Unfortunately this place have changed a lot. My husband and I were here 1 year ago and we were amazed by clearness, location, view etc. Location and view are the same) But clearness not at all: walls with a marks, bathroom with a hair, dirty towels, the ""old"" smell. Looks like this place has seen a lot... Very disappointed."
4429,66,"This condo is amazing! The view and location is amazing. The condo is brand new, super nice with an elevator. Everything was awesome.
Vanessa was a great hostess. I highly recommend staying here."
4430,66,Would definitely recommend this condo. Very clean. Beautiful scenic windows and great location! Vanesa was a joy! Answered all questions quickly and was very accommodating!
4431,66,Last minute trip and it's perfect to relax and work simultaneously.
4432,66,What a great condo. Perfect location across from the sand dollar pub and behind shuckers oyster bar. Brits world famous donuts is 100 yards away and the oven is 300 yards. This condo sits right in the middle of the fun at carolina beach and it has everything you need.
4433,67,This was an incredible experience and so very peaceful. Perfect place to unplug and just breathe. Highly recommend
4434,67,We loved staying at fox farms!! The house is absolutely beautiful and we felt right at home. Lauren really goes the extra mile to make sure you enjoy your stay. We will definitely be back!!
4435,67,"We popped in for one night because we had limited time and boy am I sad to have not planned to stay longer. The cabin was cozy, perfectly detailed, and charming. The farm was incredible. Lauren left a bag of veggies to feed the animals and wow, what a treat to my 5 year old. Lauren also offered to bring my daughter to meet freshly hatched chicks and it was so sweet. We enjoyed our authentic stay so much. We will definitely come back."
4436,67,The stay was everything described plus more. It has an amazing and cozy feel which made me feel right at home. Lauren was an amazing host and left a special treat for us as a parting gift. The best part was being greeted by all the the animals every time we walked out the door. I can’t wait to book again!
4437,67,"Lauren was fantastic with communication and went above and beyond making sure we had a great experience. My daughter LOVED sleeping in the fun loft, and feeding all the cute animals. We wanted to wander around the beautiful farm a bit more but since it was raining, we spent a lot of time playing board games inside. We had a lot of fun! Highly recommend!"
4438,67,"The Little House is an amazing place to stay. I don't think I've ever been so relaxed on a vacation. The Little House was the perfect size, super clean and so peaceful. We felt right at home here. The animals and beautiful property make for an amazing experience. I only wish it was closer to us so we could go back more often. Lauren was excellent at communicating, very friendly and welcoming."
4439,67,I can not express enough how amazing this place was this is a MUST STAY and an awesome experience I stayed with my sister and we had the best time seeing the animals and unplugging a bit! We had a show at belk theater and it was a little ways away but so worth it!! We will be back
4440,67,"Lauren’s place was so refreshing! It’s very private, surrounded by animals and nature, just so peaceful. My only wish is that I had more time!"
4441,67,"This Little House was so amazing! I was able to disconnect from the world and just breathe!!!
It was the perfect escape and Lauren was so awesome!!!"
4442,67,"Very relaxing, I could see myself staying there again. No complaints at all."
4443,67,"Lauren was very wonderful communicating, being a great host and her property was so beautiful. We enjoyed the trails and the animals. It was so wonderful to stay in a tiny home. What a joy and blessing! we will be back."
4444,67,"Beautiful family that greeted us with a friendly welcome. The property was exactly as described and what we were hoping for and more. Lovely space with all the amenities that you need. It was peaceful and serene. If you love animals as much as we do, don't pass the opportunity to stay here. They provided us with recommendations for brunch and did not disappoint. Even local family and friends didn't know about this place and will now recommend to their guests when looking for a place to stay when visiting. Thank you Fox Farm, we will definitely be back!"
4445,67,I've stayed here before and would stay here again. The cabin is very nice and well-furnished. I love the farm; it is so nice to see the animals in the morning having breakfast! The beds are comfortable too.
4446,67,We absolutely loved our stay here. It’s absolutely beautiful and peaceful and welcoming. We enjoyed time with the animals and getting to talk with Lauren our host. I truly cannot say enough about this stay and we are already planning a return trip in the fall to experience the fall colors! This is a must stay for anyone who just wants to decompress and enjoy a quiet peaceful stay!
4447,67,"This place was absolutely wonderful. Clean, comfortable and lots of animals ! I enjoyed Lauren’s responsive nature. She was kind and greeted me upon arrival. I will definitely stay here again."
4448,67,Lauren’s “little house” was exceptional. It was a great escape outside of Charlotte.
4449,67,Brilliant place and people!
4450,67,What a hidden gem in the Charlotte area! So secluded and tranquil yet close to town. The farm is stunning and we enjoyed walking the trails and visiting all the animals. The home is cozy and peaceful. Definitely looking forward to spending more time in the future!
4451,67,We had a very quick overnight stay at Laurens place but are already planning a trip back. The home is cozy and well stocked. We were able to give some of the friends out front treats in the morning and they were the sweetest. Lauren is so warm and welcoming! 10/10 would stay again.
4452,67,"A beautiful little house on a beautiful farm! Took my mom on a road trip and was so grateful to find this place. We had incredible coffee and enjoyed watching the stars, surrounded by animals. We had everything we could possibly need. Lauren was a wonderful host. Everything was perfect. Highly recommended."
4453,67,"My traveling companion and I loved our stay at The Little House! What a gem! The design, layout and decor was charming, thoughtful and welcoming. The place was very clean and neat and the bathroom was spotless.
I even slept up in the loft and was super comfy. ( I am rather petite… it might not be everyone’s choice to stay up there… but loved the view.)
Lauren was a delight to talk with and we loved meeting all the animals in the barnyard, visiting the horses and watching the dogs run around. An added surprise was getting to meet her mom and touring the horse barn… wow-first class all the way. Cleanest stables I’ve ever been around.
I love this place and will love to share with special friends. Thanks Lauren! You made us feel very welcome!"
4454,67,Lauren’s place was extremely cute! We loved being able to walk around touring the property and feeding the animals. The house itself was so peaceful and the fact it didn’t have a TV truly allowed my husband and I to reconnect and spend time in conversation and playing games away from everyday craziness. We had the opportunity to meet Lauren and she was so friendly. The town of Waxhaw is also so cute and we enjoyed all the local places there before exploring Charlotte. We highly recommend this place and will be back!
4455,67,a beautiful sanctuary to reenergize your weary mind body and soul.
4456,67,Stayed here twice and loved it both times! Host is super sweet and the place is adorable! Tiny living meets cabin getaway.
4457,67,"We love this beautiful little house! We’ve stayed here three times with plans to return again! Lauren is beyond accommodating and sweet as can be and we really enjoyed chatting with her while interacting with her puppies, goat, donkey, and mini horse. The baked treats were a special surprise and she even sent us on our way with some fresh eggs from her chickens! You can’t beat Lauren’s place for the beauty, accommodations, and hospitality. Can’t wait to return!! ❤️❤️❤️"
4458,67,Little house may be the description but this place certainly felt huge! The atmosphere was comforting and felt just like being at home. Lauren was wonderful with her recommendations and provided excellent little extra touches like snacks for the animals. The surrounding farm offered plenty to see and lots to explore. We will certainly be going here again. If not just for the farm for the wonderful activities scattered around Waxhaw.
4459,67,"Adorable place to stay! Had everything listed and felt private and like a cabin getaway. Had an issue with the heating unit breaking suddenly and Lauren was super responsive and refunded part of the cost. She also showed us her new puppies 😍

Cons: No dishes or silverware except for mugs and glasses."
4460,67,"Love this place! I was greeted by a very curious and sweet goat and then made my way to my stay. It’s a charming place, very clean, and quite comfortable.

The surroundings are beautiful, I wish I had more time to explore, but it was a business trip. The next time in the area I’ll definitely book here, highly recommended 🙂"
4461,67,"This was my 2nd time staying at Fox Farms. My 1st visit was a quick pass through and I knew I needed to book again for a longer period of time. Waking up and opening the French doors for some fresh morning air was such a treat for this city girl. Lauren and the animals : Turbo, Tina, Penelope, Phoebe & can’t forget her newest additions the PUPPIES were great host. Looking forward to future trips!"
4462,67,Repeat visitors here with a return trip already scheduled!
4463,67,Fabulous cabin on a lovely property. Beautifully decorated with all kinds of cozy comforts. We enjoyed feeding the animals and taking a walk on the grounds. Definitely recommend.
4464,67,"We will definitely be back to Lauren’s place. Not only was she great to work with but the property was the best! Comfortable furniture, cozy environment, neat details like fresh eggs and cookies left for us. Lots of history on the place, animals were a bonus! Getting to feed them treats and pet them was so fun! It was rainy and cold but we did walk around a little bit. When the weather warms up we will be booking again!"
4465,67,"Me and my girlfriend basically lived here for a week and it was the perfect getaway. The place was extremely beautiful, comfortable, and serene. Lauren has to be the best host I ever had. We had car trouble and she did not hesitate to offer assistance and we are incredibly grateful. Will definitely be coming back here for another stay!"
4466,67,You can’t go wrong by coming here
4467,67,"We highly recommend Lauren’s Little House! We felt right at home in this quaint little country setting complete with the sweetest farm animals on site you’ll ever meet. We never wanted to leave! Lauren was the perfect host, super responsive, friendly and kind, going above and beyond in any way she could to ensure our stay was pleasant. The house itself was immaculate, the bed was comfortable and all linens were freshly laundered. All the comforts of home were on site, chargers, coffee maker, small fridge, toaster, etc! I cannot say enough good things. We will be back in the near future guaranteed."
4468,67,"This little house was just perfect for us! The location and farm is absolutely beautiful! Wished we had more time to stay longer. We hope to stay again when we are traveling.

A truly unique stay."
4469,67,I literally have no words! What a special place Lauren has here. We needed a cozy spot for the night after driving 10 hrs and Fox Farms did not disappoint. Looking forward to visit in the future.
4470,67,What a beautiful setting! Quiet and peaceful. It was just what we were looking for… and needed. Thank you for your wonderful Southern hospitality!!
4471,67,"The Little House and Lauren both are outstanding. I recommend this experience with highest confidence and without any reservations, except that by leaving this review, it will be harder to book for next time😊"
4472,67,"I needed to just get out of the house, so I found Lauren’s place, booked it, and she even let me check in early. I had a great time feeding the animals and strolling in the woods. Wish I could’ve stayed longer!"
4473,67,Place was excellent. Would stay here again
4474,67,Amazing place! Will definitely book again; very peaceful and the lighting at night is very relaxing. Perfect place to clear your mind
4475,67,But that Nespresso!! You won’t be disappointed. It is one of my favorite things and I have 2 of them! :)))
4476,67,"My husband and I absolutely LOVED staying in Lauren's cozy cabin! We couldn't believe the value of this place for the price. The cabin itself is beautifully decorated and furnished, and feels very spacious. Lauren was incredibly helpful and sweet and easy to communicate with. We spent a few hours the next day visiting all the animals, and it was all just so lovely! One of our favorite AirBnb experiences to date 😊"
4477,67,Great stay on a peaceful farm in NC. Host was always easy to get in contact with and very helpful.
4478,67,"What a special place! We loved the farm, the little house, we felt right at home. Lauren was very responsive and instructions were clear. The house is so cute and peaceful. Easy to get in and out, and so close to a cute downtown Waxhaw. We hope to stay at the Little Farm House again in the future!"
4479,67,Very sweet cottage w/ amazing country decor! Attentive and accommodating host
4480,67,Cozy! Cozy! Cozy!!! This is such a peaceful retreat! Love love love! We will be back.
4481,67,"Laurens place was nice & peaceful. She is extremely professional, responds back quickly and clearly. We especially liked the little electric fireplace!"
4482,67,"There are not enough words to describe the blessing of the Little House! The quiet and the peace were exactly what I was needing during my trip. The farm itself was absolutely beautiful, and I could have spent all day just standing my the fence and scratching Turbo's nose! He is just the sweetest. The cabin was so cozy, comfortable, and clean (and the water pressure was phenomenal!) Waxhaw is such a lovely little town, very walkable and lots to do. I highly recommend lunch at Cork & Ale, and if you are looking to pamper yourself, a massage with Lila at Prayerful Touch is an absolute must. I'm already planning my next visit! Thank you Lauren and family for sharing this wonderful place with all of us :o)"
4483,67,Lauren’s little house is a wonderful place to unwind and relax! The animals are precious and the land and house are beautiful! Such a serene experience!
4484,67,Great stay. Wish we could have stayed longer but we had to get back on the road. Feeding the animals was awesome. The little house was perfect and the property was beautiful. We definitely plan to stay again in the future.
4485,67,"Thank you so much for the wonderful stay at the fox farms cabin, it was such a cozy stay in this beautiful home. Loved the peaceful area & all the sweet animals!"
4486,67,"Loved it.
Cant wait to stay again"
4487,67,"This was an absolutely amazing stay. The house was adorable and perfectly matched the description. We didn't really run into any issues, but the few questions I did have Lauren responded to very quickly. She even left us some treats to feed her animals, which is a unique and fun touch. She also gave extremely detailed and helpful directions for how to get there, which was great since it was dark when we got there. But we had no trouble finding it following her instructions. Gorgeous, private, peaceful setting too. But downtown Waxhaw has tons of great restaurants and things to do if desired. I will definitely be back and couldn't be happier with my experience."
4488,67,"Wow! What can I say about the Little House and Lauren? This was the perfect stay! The place was absolutely breathtaking beautiful with all the fall scenery around. The house was cozy but comfortable, perfect for two people. We stayed for 6 nights and had an amazing time. The place is perfect for just sitting outside and listening to nature or exploring the town. More importantly, Lauren was the perfect host. Incredibly communicative and always willing help, providing suggestions and even warning us about the weather. Seriously, when airbnb was invented this was the kind of place and host experience it envisioned. I hope to come back soon!"
4489,67,This place is INCREDIBLE! The cabin is so cute and cozy ❤️ we just stayed for one evening but we wished we had time to stay more to fully explore all that the property has to offer. Check in was super easy considering we had a last minute booking. Definitely recommend this stay and we will be looking forward to making it back someday.
4490,67,"Such a great stay! Beautiful atmosphere and the host was so friendly. Instructions to find the place were wonderful. My only disappointment is that I was merely using the stay as a place to sleep and had my days filled already with other things. There is so much beauty and peace found on this property. I plan on coming back just to enjoy the stay - no plans but to walk the property and spend time with the animals. The host is helpful and friendly.

Oh and the story about the little house, property, and family. I’m so glad I took the time to read about it all. So interesting!!"
4491,67,Wow! Incredible place. You will not be disappointed. Great host! And SO QUIET!!! This is the place for some downtime. Would definitely visit again!
4492,67,"The ""Little House"" was just as described. It was clean, comfortable and very nicely decorated. We enjoyed the calm, quiet, peaceful surroundings along with the beautiful property. We are looking forward to our next visit."
4493,67,"My husband and I, in light of our 4th wedding anniversary, had such a wonderful stay at Lauren's beautiful farm. At the very moment we arrived we felt welcomed to look around and explore the property which was a unique experience we had seldom encountered with an Airbnb before! We loved seeing all of the Autumn colours, cracking open pecans, reading on the porch, walking the trail behind the little house, and of course, petting the loveable (and quite personable) animals. We also chanced to see many deer, a myriad of birds, and even some stars shoot across the heavens at night! The hard work and dedication that goes into the farm is self-evident and Lauren is a MASTER host! She went above and beyond and all of her small yet laborious touches did not go unnoticed nor unappreciated!

The town of Waxhaw is also close by and we highly recommend the Virtuoso Bakery, Provisions and the Alphabet Museum! We felt very blessed to be welcomed onto Fox Farm and would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to escape into nature for some peace and quiet.

- Jenn & Callum T."
4494,67,"This place is AMAZING !
We enjoyed this place for 2 wonderful days.

Our Host Lauren was Fantastic and Attentive to our needs.

She also gave us helful suggestions like taking a hike in the meadows
You should try it, you will definitely enjoy it.

This place is by far the BEST Airbnb I have ever stayed in . ...
But check it out for yourself.

Lamb & Romana Montero"
4495,67,"This adorable little house was perfect for my daughter and granddaughter when they came into town to visit. Check in information was very clear, and they loved the quiet setting with horses. Lauren was a super responsive communicator, from booking to checkout. I can't recommend her place enough."
4496,67,"Fantastic one of a kind place to stay. After a long drive from Pennsylvania, our evening was so quiet and peaceful. The Little House at Fox Farms had everything that we needed for our stay. Will definitely recommend to our friends ."
4497,67,"You will find your time on this horse farm very relaxing. It is a delightful location with wonderful hosts. If you just want to get away and do nothing but read, etc., this is a place to go. It welcomes quiet contemplation."
4498,67,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Little House. Lauren was a wonderful hostess, making us feel as if we were members of the family!
We enjoyed feeding the family’s farm animals who were friendly and tame."
4499,67,Such a beautiful and peaceful place. I've stayed here twice and hope I can come back every year! The little house has everything I need for a short visit. Love it!
4500,67,"I don't know where to start! My wife and I own a few airbnb units in Myrtle Beach and have stayed at many, many airbnb's over the years and this is by far the nicest and most relaxing one so far. We enjoyed everything from the absolutely gorgeous views of this 160+- acre estate to all of the neat farm animals. The cottage is sooo cute, clean, comfy and the perfect place to stay. We were only 2 miles or so from downtown and yet it felt like heaven. Lauren was a gracious host and even left us some treats and homemade cookies which were very tasty. We will definitely be back!"
4501,67,"The Little House is a slice of heaven. Lauren is a spectacular hostess! It is wonderfully quiet; I think the only sounds we heard were that of the farm animals and they were a welcome and relaxing sound! Physically, The Little House is quaint and comfortable. Two big comfy chairs, a small table with chairs, a microwave, coffee maker and sink made up the living area. The bed and a bathroom were on the far side of the room. Given that Tropical Storm Ian was lashing outside our window, the weather was cold and damp but Lauren had added an extra warm blanket and made sure the space heater worked so we were warm and comfortable. This was a lovely stay that we needed to cut short because of the storm to catch our flight. We are looking forward to our next stay!"
4502,67,"Very clean, quiet, and relaxing. Friendly animals and lots of outdoor space to take a walk or let your kids play."
4503,67,Hubby is a manager at Omni Grove Park Inn in Asheville so we have extremely high standards. Little House has surpassed them all. Even though we have a daughter we can stay with in the area we hope to be back for the peace and quiet and to enjoy the animals. Kudos to Lauren and Travis and many Thanks !
4504,67,"Beautiful scenery, clean and comfortable stay."
4505,67,Lauren is an awesome host. The fox farm was everything and more. The atmosphere was so comfortable and peaceful. Will definitely return when in the Charlotte area.
4506,67,"AMAZING!
My husband and I loved everything about the Little House at Fox Farm...right down to the treats Lauren leaves you to give her animals! It's an amazing property and we felt fortunate that Lauren and her family are willing to share it. Communication with Lauren ahead of time was great and she is so nice once you get to meet her!
HIGHLY RECOMMEND....and look forward to returning some day ❤️"
4507,67,Wonderful stay. Peaceful in nature and on a lovely farm with animals. We were able to pet the donkeys. Would love to come back!
4508,67,"The Little House is on a beautiful farm with lovely people and the sweetest animals! The house has everything we needed, including history of the property and some great local recommendations. Lauren is so genuine and hospitable, we’ll definitely be returning!"
4509,67,"Beautiful, very clean, peaceful and comfortable. This place is by far one of the best Airbnb experiences we’ve had. The only negative was that we couldn’t stay longer."
4510,67,"Me and my fiancé stayed here as a little getaway for our anniversary. He’s been gone almost a year because of the military and we wanted some time for ourselves. It was a lovely stay. The animals are awesome. Our favorite was the donkey. We also got to briefly see the pig. We loved him. Being able to talk a walk, feed the animals, and enjoy a time away from normal life was nothing short of refreshing. It is very cozy and cute. All the added things that guests can personalize added to the experience. Overall our experience was amazing, and we’d love to come back again!"
4511,67,Lauren is very responsive and hospitable. The little house is charming and comfortable. It is a nice quiet space for a remote worker or for a couple in need of a little get-away-from-it-all while conveniences and restaurants are just 10 minutes away.
4512,67,"House is as advertised. Amazing scenery and the utmost privacy. The house was clean and everything worked (AC, lights, fridge, etc). You can tell that Lauren takes great pride in her house."
4513,67,"It is a serene and beautiful place. If you love nature and animals, this place will make you happy. The little house had everything we needed. Lauren gave us all necessary instructions, and we stayed fully informed. The nearby town Waxhaw was a great surprise - such a cozy little town has everything we got used to living in a big city! Also, Charlotte is just 50 minutes away."
4514,67,"Lauren’s place is so cute and cozy, it was the perfect place to stay in between drives from the west of NC to the east. I had the pleasure of getting to meet and chat with Lauren for a bit as well as her son Evan and they were both very kind. I cannot stress enough how peaceful this place is and how lovely it was to get to meet all the animals. The horses are beautiful, timid but sweet. All the barn animals have big personalities and are perfectly described in the welcome book. They are all lovely, but Tina the donkey has a permanent place in my heart, what a sweetie. My partner and I enjoyed a long sit by the fire pit and watched the day turn to night. Thank you again Lauren! This is a very special place."
4515,67,You need to stay here! It will help you find a little peace.
4516,67,"Lauren’s place was amazing! Very clean and cozy! We unfortunately only stayed for one night. If we ever get a chance to, will definitely go again!"
4517,67,Loved this little house! It was everything I expected.... and more ....for a weekend getaway to unplug and relax. Loved feeding the animals and the cute little cookies that Lauren left were a special touch! Thanks Lauren! I would definitely choose to stay here again.
4518,68,little peaceful get away. would stay again
4519,68,Thank you so much Joe!
4520,68,The view was absolutely outstanding! And just a beautiful oasis away from the city. Highly recommended.
4521,68,Thank you so much Sarah!
4522,68,"Can't say enough about our stay! The spectacular view of the mountains and peaceful atmosphere of the tiny home was just what we were looking for. Everything from the interior setup of the tiny home, its outdoor amenities, and full size kitchen appliances and bath tub/shower was perfect. It wasn't just a place to sleep, but a place to enjoy. We'll definitely be back!"
4523,68,"Our stay was so lovely! The Mountain View is even more impressive than at the fotos and it is so nice and quiet. The tiny house was very clean, cozy and the heating worked well. Mike was very friendly and a great host! We would love to come back. We had a wonderful stay!"
4524,68,Thank you so much Inga!
4525,68,"Highly recommend staying at this tiny house! Michael and Samantha were very helpful throughout our stay! The surroundings are absolutely beautiful, and perfect for a weekend getaway! The tiny house has everything you could need for a weekend overall this was a great experience!!"
4526,68,Thank you John!
4527,68,Wonderful place to stay. We enjoyed walking down the path to the other house and back up through the woods. Will definitely come back!
4528,68,Thank you you Sherri!
4529,68,"I’ve stayed at this air bnb twice now, and the hosts have been outstanding. They’re responsive, helpful, and extremely kind, and their property is the perfect private getaway. I can’t wait to go back!"
4530,68,Thank you Emma!
4531,68,Beautiful space for our couples getaway. Very private and peaceful. Highly recommend!
4532,68,"I enjoyed my mountain stay here. The view in the morning and the stars at night were the best part! If you don’t enjoy mountain driving, I wouldn’t recommend this place but it’s not a far drive from local towns or Boone. The place was clean and the bed was very comfortable. I had an issue the first night with the wifi and they called me within minutes to fix it! They are great hosts. Highly recommend this place!"
4533,68,My fiancé and I had a wonderful stay at Michael and Samantha’s place! The scenery is beautiful and the tiny house is quaint and cozy. We would certainly recommend!
4534,68,Place was amazing . Quiet and beautiful. Michael was very friendly and helpful. We will come back for sure .
4535,68,"No words can really describe the peaceful vibe this Airbnb gives. The view is STUNNING. It will not disappoint, if your hesitate about booking don’t be, book it! The host Michael was super friendly and very helpful and responsive, definitely will be seeing us again!"
4536,68,This place is great and has everything you should need in a super cozy set up. It is an awesome way to spend time in one of the most beautiful parts of the country. Michael and Samantha were very accommodating with my last minute booking and made sure we had everything we needed. I hope to be back again.
4537,68,"The drive is amazing and scenic, not for the faint of heart or those who lack confidence.

The tiny home was amazing, but the views we woke up to were even better. We had no problems at all and just wished we hadnt forgotten to sign the guest book!

They were great hosts and we had a fantastic time."
4538,68,"This was the best and one of my favorite airbnb experiences! Michael went above and beyond by being extremely responsive and helpful the entire time. The tiny house was better than we could’ve ever imagined. Secluded in the mountains with an unbelievable view right out your window! There is so much to do within a short drive, but the house was so cozy we didn’t want to leave. It has all the amenities you need for a comfortable stay. I can’t wait to stay here again!"
4539,68,Amazing stay!
4540,68,Absolutely enjoyed our stay and even woke up to beautiful snow!!! Loved sitting outside by the fire and just enjoying the peace and quite. The views are spectacular! Cozy little spot. Will be back soon!!!
4541,68,Michael and Samantha were amazing hosts. When looking for a perfect getaway this is the spot to choose. Spending just 2 nights at this spot felt like a complete refresh and reset from everyday worries. I cannot think of a more perfect location to unwind but also be so close to so many things like downtown boone and varieties of mountains and restaurants. If your looking for a perfect stay this is it!
4542,68,"Absolutely fantastic place to stay, perfect for a couples get away. View was amazing!!"
4543,68,We loved our stay and loved our experience with Michael and Samantha. The home was absolutely magical in the snow and so cozy. We had one hiccup with some frozen pipes and Michael personally called me to take care of it. 10/10 experience.
4544,68,"My boyfriend and I had such a wonderful time here. It was just enough space for us, and the view was incredible. It's also not too far from Boone, which has great restaurants and shops. Michael and Samantha were incredibly thoughtful and responsive as well, and we so appreciated their above-and-beyond hospitality! We will absolutely be back!"
4545,68,"""DAD, CAN WE GO SOMEWHERE TO SEE SNOW?"" THIS WAS THE PREFACE OF OUR STAY AT MOUNTAINVIEW TINY HOUSE. I PLANNED THIS TRIP AFTER FRANTICALLY TRACKING WINTER STORMS NEAR OUR HOME IN FLORIDA; AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT, WE'D BE MET WITH WEATHER IN THE 50'S & NO SNOW. NONETHELESS, THIS TRIP PROVIDED QUALITY TIME WITH MY DAUGHTER. FROM DAILY WALKS AROUND RED ARROW LOOP TRAIL, BOARD GAMES, BREAKFAST, WILDLIFE, & FIRE SIDE CUPS OF HOT CHOCOLATE; WE HAD AN AMAZING TIME!!! 10/10. AMAZING HOSTS, ONLY A TEXT AWAY."
4546,68,The photos listed don’t do it justice. The view is stunning. The inside of the home was super spacious. It had everything you needed inside. The bed was especially comfy and we loved the electric fireplace that was right at the foot of the bed. The driving directions they provided made a huge difference in making the drive easier. The hosts were very kind and responsive. We will absolutely book again.
4547,68,Clean and comfortable. Beautiful views and very peaceful.
4548,68,We absolutely loved our stay at Mountainview Tiny House! The host were so attentive and responsive during our stay. The views were spectacular! We truly had the best cabin experience. Thank you again Michael and Samantha for sharing your mountain bliss with us. We look forward to visiting again.
4549,68,"We really enoyed spending the week at the tiny house. We had fun visisting the nearby small towns (Boone, Blowing Rock, and West Jefferwson). We had a nice view of the Beech Mountain Ski Slopes from the deck. The host was attentive and answered all of our questions right away. We had snow onm our last night and one degree temperatures. The tiny house was comfortable and warm."
4550,68,We loved it! Beautiful place and area! You can see one of the ski resorts from the cabin and we had such great views of the sky! The inside is perfectly cozy and set up. The fireplace at the end of the bed is so amazing! Kept us warm and felt cozy! Thanks for a great stay!
4551,68,"Wonderful stay, amazing hosts, truly breathtaking view with an incredible atmosphere. Quick, caring, responsive hosts who made our stay memorable! We will definitely be going again."
4552,68,Thank you Amir for being a great guest and leaving a great review! Please come back soon.
4553,68,Our stay at the tiny house was amazing! The hosts were incredibly friendly and helpful and great with communication. The house itself is so cute and clean and exactly what I wanted to make my mountain vacation perfect.
4554,68,"Thank you, Rachel, for your kind words and being such a great guest! We hope you come stay with us again soon in the mountains."
4555,68,We had a great time for our first trip in the mountains. A very beautiful home and area. You don’t even need a awd vehicle which is a huge plus!!!! Thank you guys so much.
4556,68,"Thank you, Keishawn! We hope you visit again soon."
4557,68,"We loved our stay at the Mountain View tiny house! The view was incredible. The windy road up to the house is not for the faint of heart, but well worth it!"
4558,68,"Thank you, Ashley, for the nice review and being a great guest."
4559,68,"Fantastic , everything was
Nice and clean. Great location ."
4560,68,"We SO enjoyed our stay at Michael & Samantha’s place. The tiny house was very clean & homey. It was perfect for two people, and the view of the mountains was amazing! We were given our space, but I will say that Michael was very responsive when we needed something & proactive when it came to checking in on us. This was a one year wedding anniversary trip that I booked for my husband back in February, and was well worth the wait! Downtown Boone was only a 30 minute ride, and was so fun at night! All of the restaurants we went to had a fun vibe and delicious food. We will be back :)"
4561,68,Thank you so much for your kind words and great review. We love hosting excellent guests like yourselves.
4562,68,We enjoyed our stay! It’s a little off the beaten path but definitely worth it. The house was very clean and the check in & out was super easy. Michael was super fast to respond to any messages. Would recommend!
4563,68,Thank you for being great guests! We also appreciate the constructive criticism.
4564,68,"A quaint place of solitude in nature. I am so grateful for my stay and would recommend it to anyone who wants to get away. I was in awe of the Mountain View’s. Every morning watching the clouds come in and at night, the stars. So beautiful! The tiny home was just big enough to rest. Lots of natural light & a cozy bed tucked away in the corner. Michael & Samantha are quick to answer if you have any questions. Would highly recommend :)"
4565,68,The perfect peaceful and quiet mountain getaway! The hosts were quick with communication and very attentive. The perfect tiny house for a weekend away with amazing views.
4566,68,This tiny house has everything thing you need!The views are priceless and absolutely incredible ! The only bad thing was having to leave this tiny slice of heaven. I will definitely be back. Wonderful host’s with great communication 😁
4567,68,Perfect little get away for our first anniversary trip! Michael and Samantha were quick to respond and made sure we had the things we would need! The view in the pictures don't do it justice for what you see in person. Such a beautiful place!
4568,68,"The view from this tiny home is absolutely stunning! We loved how remote we were and all the amenities on the lot. We barely left the entire weekend. Perfect couple getaway. We stargazed, roasted marshmallows, grilled steaks, and enjoyed the spectacular view and fall weather! Added bonus was being able to see the stars from bed at night and a small fireplace in front of the bed. Really made for a cozy experience. Highly recommend."
4569,68,"We enjoyed our time in this tiny home.
It was lovely, we had everything we needed. We are happy that we were there this fall and it was all worth it. The view was excellent.
We met Michael on our way to the cabin and he was very nice and helpful.

It was a great experience. :)"
4570,68,Such a nice place. Excellent view from the deck and the huge window. Great wooded walks begin right outside the door. And as a bonus we chose the peak foliage week. Would definitely stay here again.
4571,68,"Fall trip October 8th-15th 2022.

The vibrant colors were in peak season!

THE VIEW! The breadth of the view is worth the mountain drive up to the tiny house. Pictures just don’t do justice. Bring a pair of binoculars for birdwatching! My wife and I also saw plenty of deer on and around the property.

THE STARS! My wife and I spent our last night stargazing from the deck. Absolutely breathtaking!

THE TINY HOUSE itself is wonderful! Simple, cute, modern, and has just enough space to comfortably house two! The huge window fills the place with the warm sunlight. Perfect for your morning cup of coffee.

P.S. my wife and I discovered a small apple tree near the driveway as you enter the property. The host Michael allowed us to pick freely from it. Delicious fruit! Just make sure you leave enough for the next guest!"
4572,68,Samantha and Michael are great host.Nice tiny home in the mountains.Just what we wanted for our anniversary trip.
4573,68,"Just a beautiful spot, and everything you want for a nice, peaceful stay. Great hosts!"
4574,68,"This was our first time staying in a tiny house and it was amazing! Views, location, the peacefulness, everything was amazing! Cannot recommend enough, and we would definitely love to come back!"
4575,68,"Such a cute, clean tiny house with an awesome view. About a 30 minute drive to multiple little mountain towns. We met Michael as we were leaving and it was a pleasure! 10/10 recommend!"
4576,68,Michael and Samantha were stellar hosts. They went above and beyond to make sure we were well taken care of during our stay. The house was clean and had everything we needed…. Not to mention the location in the mountains of TN/NC was second to none!
4577,68,"Very cute tiny home with amazing views! Stayed here for a couple nights to hike Grandfather mountain, it was perfect!"
4578,68,"Driving the 9 mile road to get to the top of the mountain is a little challenging but the view is well worth it. We took our portable Sonos speaker and sitting on the deck with the fire feature, music and a bottle of wine is difficult to beat."
4579,68,Amazing view and great stay. Excellent communications and customer service.
4580,68,"Absolutely would come again. From the ease of communication to the amazing layout and design, it’s just a gift."
4581,68,Such a great location and views. We’d definitely book it again!
4582,68,This house is the perfect place for a serene getaway. The view is beautiful and the deck is a wonderful place to relax outside and enjoy nature. Michael and Samantha were very attentive and responsive hosts. Would highly recommend this place and would stay there again!
4583,68,"Amazing all around. The views are spectacular, the tiny house a wonderful experience, the area breathtaking. Hoping to return to see the fall foliage. Michael & Samantha are great hosts."
4584,68,We had a fabulous time! We went to get away from our busy lifestyle and had a great time relaxing and taking in the view!! The house was further from Boone than we expected but it was 100% worth it for the view and tranquility!! The house had everything we needed! We cooked our own meal on the grill and enjoyed our time by the fire! The view was amazing both during the day and at night! There was a small issue before we arrived but Michael made sure to contact us about it and had everything sorted out before we arrived! All in all we really enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend this place!!
4585,68,"We absolutely loved this tiny home. It may be called a tiny home but it definitely was spacious!!
the view looking over to the mountain was gorgeous. we would just look out and be in awe.
my husband and i decided to walk from the tiny home to the state line. (just about a mile). Shows how out of shape we both are but glad we did it.
It was a great anniversary weekend away for us."
4586,68,Clean and cozy little get away!
4587,68,"An absolute gem! We had a positively wonderful experience here. As has been noted elsewhere, the views alone are worth the stay - you can see for miles and miles right from the kitchen table. The house itself was perfectly suited for a great weekend away - cracked the windows during a beautiful rain, played cards for hours, made breakfast and coffee each morning, enjoyed easy access to a smart TV, and soaked up the uninterrupted sounds of nature on the deck. We highly recommend this stay for someone who needs a moment of silence and solitude in this busy world!"
4588,68,We had an amazing vacation at Michael and Samantha’s tiny home! Checking in was a breeze and they were able to respond to our questions very quickly. Our view was killer and it was the perfect place for a couples retreat. Would definitely stay here again next time I’m in the mountains :)!!!
4589,68,"This cozy little home was a perfect spot for a quiet mountain getaway. The outdoor fire pit was perfect for long talks while taking in the gorgeous view under the stars. The bed was really comfortable and we also played a few games that were there! Thank you for hosting us, exactly what we needed."
4590,68,"This is a lovely, thoughtfully put together tiny home. We felt nothing was missing during our 3-day stay. Like others have mentioned, the view is better in person."
4591,68,This stay is perfect. If you are contemplating the answer is yes. It was everything you want in and air bnb and so so beautiful! Our mountain trip would not have been as amazing without it. Can’t recommend this air bnb enough!!
4592,68,"Thank you so much, Caitlyn, for your kind words. We hope you return soon to the mountains!"
4593,68,What a great little getaway spot! I’ve always been wanted to stay in a tiny home and this one surely did not disappoint. Thanks Michael and Samantha for making this possible!
4594,68,Such a nice place we will definitely be back!
4595,68,Highly recommend this place! The tiny house is beautiful and the location is stunning. If you get the chance check out the stars and the fireflies here!
4596,68,"We had a great time at Michael and Samantha’s “little house” in the mountains above Boone. Cute as a button. Everything was perfect. Accommodations we’re great. There was a fire pit for toasting marshmallows and a separate gas fire on the deck - perfect for warming the body while watching the stars. Good, central location. Lots of privacy. Super sunsets. We highly recommend this one of a kind place."
4597,68,"WOW is all we can say about this house and the view that is absolutely breathtaking !!

Check in and out was a breeze. The home was clean and organized. This was our first time in a tiny home and we absolutely look forward to spending time in one again.

Michael and Samantha were amazing hosts !"
4598,68,The view is unbeatable and the location is perfect for doing excursions! We loved every part of our stay!
4599,68,"This place was awesome. The view was even better than the pictures show. Michael and Samantha were super responsive and helpful with everything we needed before and during our stay. A must-stay if you’re looking for a private, secluded getaway."
4600,68,Thank you to you and your wife for the kind words. We look forward to seeing you again!
4601,68,The tiny home was an amazing place to stay with just me and my boyfriend. It had all the essentials you needed for the space. The view was absolutely amazing! Even with the other tiny home nearby you still had privacy.
4602,68,"You will truly enjoy watching the clouds move over the mountains as you drink your coffee. Birds and butterflies and bees are welcome companions. The outdoor grill is fantastic for tasty romantic dinners for two. Shower pressure is great and the size of the shower is fantastic for a tiny home, too. Michael and Samantha responded to a minor issue we had within 10 minutes. Bravo!!! Thank you again for your hospitality and sharing your lovely tiny home."
4603,68,Thank you for your kind words in your review. We are sorry to see that your experience deserved a four star rating. We would love for you to contact us and let us know what we could improve.
4604,68,Michael and Samantha’s place is a great stay. Ran into Michael and he was pleasant.
4605,68,"We had to best time at the tiny house! Michael and Samantha was great host! Everything was amazing, so clean and quiet! The views was the best! Best views I’ve ever seen! Will definitely be back!!"
4606,68,"This is the perfect tiny house with a BEAUTIFUL view! The house had everything we needed and was the perfect place to unplug in nature. Absolutely, definitely, 100% recommend staying here!!"
4607,68,"We had a great time at the Mountainview Tiny House celebrating our anniversary. It was a beautiful secluded little getaway with enough space for the two of us to enjoy our time together. It was a beautiful home and even though it rained part of our stay we enjoyed listening to the rain and watching the storm through the big window in the kitchen. It had a great kitchen and we enjoyed cooking our meals, as well as exploring the property and surrounding areas. We had no issues and everything was very clear with instructions in the listing and binder with information in the tiny home. Michael and Samantha were very prompt and thorough with communication during the booking process with the many questions I had, as well as during our stay, making sure we were comfortable. A beautiful tiny home and a gorgeous view. Thank you for a great stay and we look forward to coming back!! :)"
4608,68,"Thank you, Jaden, for your kind words! We hope you come stay with us again soon."
4609,68,I can’t say enough good things about this place! I came here to get away from a super stressful few months and this place provides the peace I needed. The view is absolutely incredible. Everything is so cozy and the bed is incredibly comfy! The owners are super nice and very fast in the communication. I hope to stay here again in the future!
4610,68,We are so glad that you enjoyed it! It is quite a respite from the rest of the world.
4611,68,A great place to stay and the views were amazing! The shower pressure was also great. We will be staying again!
4612,68,Thank you for your kind words and suggestions. We have taken note the couple things. Please come stay with us again. Take care.
4613,69,"Was vacationing to Hilton Head with my Bf. Drove 7 hrs and needed a night to crash somewhere on the way. Found this amazing, adventurous, peaceful dome. The hot tub was exactly what was needed after a long drive. Thank you so much!"
4614,69,Such a cute and cozy place!
4615,69,Overall our stay was very nice. The yurt was very clean and the hot tub was nice. There were a few minor issues including: heating in the yurt at night was difficult as it dipped below freezing and the zipper was broken on the front “door” so it was quite chilly at night and the hot tub buttons didn’t work so there were no jets. It was very charming sitting in the hot tub under the lights at night and the hot tub did a decent job of staying hot with the cover off. I would possibly return but in the fall or spring so it isn’t too hot or cold.
4616,69,"Our dome has a lot of unique and interesting features like a hot tub and quartz heaters. Most things people aren’t used to using but are included in the house manual. The hot tub worked fine both before and after this stay and the heaters were able to keep the dome at 70-72 degrees before and after this stay as well. If you ever find yourselves uncomfortable or unsure of how to use anything while glamping with us, please reach out. This guest did not and unfortunately was unable to take full advantage of her stay. If you are a unique stay checking this review to see if Abby is a good fit for your property, I would suggest over communication on the unique aspects of your property and checking in often, otherwise she may not enjoy."
4617,69,Great getaway spot! Very private and peaceful neighborhood. Definitely recommend!
4618,69,Had a great stay :)
4619,69,Thought it was going to be more excluded I believe the price should go down just a bit because of that. because of the location there was a dog barking at night. However other than that very good stay
4620,69,"We enjoyed glamping! The place was great - a little outdoor adventure my wife and I really enjoyed. We enjoyed the retreat, and then time in Charlotte the next day. It was a wonderful getaway."
4621,69,Was very nice place
4622,69,"Great stay, extremely relaxing and beautiful place. Many accommodations and very fun to spend a weekend in."
4623,69,"We had a great time staying in the dome for Valentine’s Day! The area was peaceful, intimate, and an overall very fun experience. Soaking in the hot tub and watching movies on the huge projector screen were perfect ways for us to end our date night. The host was responsive and gave very helpful instructions for operating everything. Thanks Matthew! We will definitely be recommending this place to our friends!"
4624,69,"Such a fun experience. I stayed here while on a work trip and it was everything I was hoping for. It rained heavily the first evening but I stayed plenty warm enough with all the heaters and blankets.
The owners provided excellent instructions and I didn’t have any trouble figuring things out."
4625,69,"My girlfriend and I stayed a night here after spending a day in Charlotte. It was a really peaceful and private experience! We loved the hot tub was really nice, and the tent was warm and cozy! 10/10 a great place to unwind and decompress away from home! You will not regret staying here!"
4626,69,"We enjoyed our stay glamping in this cold weather!! The hot tub was top notch and the heated mattress was thoughtful during this time. It felt as if we really were camping outdoors. It was peaceful while doing literally nothing, but watch Netflix on the big projector :) we would be back!!!"
4627,69,Such a cozy little get away and so close to Charlotte! Very impressed with this stay. Plenty of heaters during the cold winter temps and a fun little hot tub to warm up in!
4628,69,Matthews dome was such an awesome experience!! It was surprisingly super warm and cozy. We loved cuddling up and watching movies on the projector or running out to downtown Belmont where there are tons of amazing food options. We felt very safe and Matthew was an excellent host. We definitely hope to be back! 😊
4629,69,"Matthew and Stephanie were responsive and helpful hosts. The property was exactly as expected and more. Kept clean and a fun space! Small extras were provided to make us more comfortable, including complimentary wine, snacks, Netflix etc. and they even had the glamping space heated before our arrival (the temperature dropped that night) so we'd be more comfortable. Overall exceptional and unique stay."
4630,69,Place was lovely. Recommend 100 %
4631,69,Winter glamping was a perfect get away for a couple days. Very nice environment for a couple.
4632,69,One of the best airbnbs I’ve ever stayed in! Very clean and comfortable setting! Matthew was phenomenal!! Quick to respond to any questions or concerns we had! Definitely will be back!
4633,69,Such a fun getaway! My husband & i aren’t normally into camping but this made it so fun & we will definitely be back!
4634,69,Amazing space! It was clean and easy to find. Was in a safe neighborhood and a decent easy distance from the city. I had a water issue due to using it too fast and the host quickly answered and refilled it for us. Also refunded us $20 which was super nice. Hottub was perfect & was the inside was super warm considering it was December!
4635,69,Great stay!
4636,69,"Took a weekend vacation here in early December with my boyfriend for our anniversary. The dome was very relaxing and cozy. The hot tub was well worth it during the chilly weather. The hosts, Matthew and Stephanie, were very quick to respond to any questions and gave great recommendations for things to do and eat around Belmont. They also provided some snacks and drinks for our stay. Definitely a place I would rebook again if I’m in the area and recommend to others!"
4637,69,Very good place. We enjoyed the stay and loved the projector setup
4638,69,"Traveled from Pittsburgh, PA to NC because I liked the uniqueness of this Airbnb.

Very happy I made the decision to do so. I had such a great experience and will be back soon!"
4639,69,Peace & tranquility in a safe warm environment.
4640,69,"Cozy, private, and comfortable space. We really enjoyed the hot tub on a cold night and the outdoor bathroom is so cool! Had some issues with the power shutting off if we tried to run the heater and any other devices at the same time but the owners were very attentive and communicative and gave us a discount for the trouble. They are fixing the issue immediately for future guests as well. We would definitely stay here again!"
4641,69,"I loved the stay. The bed was very comfy and the individual heat settings were an added bonus! The dome tent and amenities were very cozy. Two cons: Althoug area appeared safe, husband wanted a way to lock the gate door from the inside. Secondly, water was dirty yellow and didn't appear clean for use of shower and brushing teeth - we stayed one night and this was a minor con for me.

Overall, the experience was nice and I would do it again."
4642,69,"Unfortunately, this guest did not see the gate lock located on the inside of the gate. You can completely lock yourself in very simply. As with anything at Charlotte Glamping, we are just a message away from assisting you so don’t hesitate to ask!

Also, this guest did not experience unclean water. We noticed that this guest broke a piece of the water system in the back which had to be fixed after their stay. The mention of “yellow water” unfortunately looks like an attempt to pass blame. Our water system has a 3 step filtering system. Even if all filters fail, there are filters in-line that deliver purely clean water. We drank and professionally tested this water the same day with no issues.

We look forward to hosting you! If for any reason you experience a challenge during your stay, we are here to help, thanks!"
4643,69,Absolutely loved it!
4644,69,"A great place for a getaway! if you have the chance to book, don't hesitate!"
4645,69,Such a quaint getaway! Loved all the special touches & the hot tub was amazing! 💓
4646,69,Our anniversary stay was absolutely amazing! Matthew and Stephanie are fantastic hosts it was the perfect relaxing staycation and we will be back!
4647,69,"Had a wonderful stay!!!! Was one of the best weekends we have had in a while, a bottle of wine was left for my girlfriends birthday which was very nice. As well as a birthday card written by the host, very friendly host and a overall wonderful stay."
4648,69,very nice
4649,69,We thoroughly enjoyed our anniversary stay! We had a night in and ordered some take out. Got in the Hottub which was super easy to use and then had a movie night with the big projector (also easy to use!). The videos that explained the bathroom were super helpful and the bed was heavenly. I definitely will be booking again
4650,69,Our stay in the dome was AMAZING! It was a perfect getaway for our mini-honeymoon and they even left rose petals and a bottle of wine on the bed for us when we arrived. The projector was also a fantastic touch for us to relax and watch our favorite shows. 10/10 would recommend!
4651,69,"We had an absolutely perfect stay at this backyard bungalow! A perfect retreat in North Carolina. The technology was super easy to use, and the host provided clear communication."
4652,69,If you’re looking to disconnect and unwind in comfort- This is the place to be!!! The hosts are amazing and the space is very safe and private while still being in a convenient location. Such a relaxing time. The Hottub was perfect.
4653,69,"This place was so much better than the pictures! I highly recommend staying here! It’s a perfect little get away just outside Charlotte. Very relaxing, private & peaceful."
4654,69,"Great weekend getaway! Came for our anniversary and it was amazing. Secluded spot, but still really close to the city!"
4655,69,My partner and I stayed here to celebrate our anniversary. Great night away! Has everything you need and so cute. We had issues with the ac and the owners were so quick to respond and fix the issue. We even got a bottle of wine. Definitely recommend !
4656,69,Had a great time staying at this glamping spot! The hot tub was great and the location was private. Matthew was very helpful and communicative!
4657,69,The stay was incredible. It’s exactly what was in the pictures and only 30 minutes to the city! The hot tub and night with the lights was a great feature! Will definitely be coming back!
4658,69,"Nice and modern space. The bathroom is different but very cool technology. Went for my fiancés birthday and they had flowers and balloons ready. Perfect balance of nature and indoors. Don’t want to deal with the bugs, smells, sun, and weather that comes with traditional camping? This is the spot for you. Thanks Matt and Steph"
4659,69,I really enjoyed my stay here ! It was the perfect relaxing setting to celebrate my boyfriends birthday!
4660,69,"This was the best Airbnb!! It was such a unique experience that was made even better by the hospitality of the host. Everything was very clean, the snacks provided were a wonderful touch, and check in was easy. This Airbnb has everything you could need and is perfect for a couples getaway! The movie screen was super cool and the hot tub was very relaxing. The AC unit kept the bubble nice and cool and the bed was very comfortable. We hope to stay again in the future!!"
4661,69,"The whole experience was WONDERFUL. I can’t get over how thoughtful and kind our hosts were! They went above and beyond for us with looking after our dog when we forgot our crate. It was my birthday and I was surprised with a card, balloons, and snacks. They always communicated fast. All in all even with bad weather a wonderful birthday in this adorable location!!💗"
4662,69,Great time!
4663,69,"This place was so wonderful!! You should definitely book this for your trip, you will not regret it! It was absolutely adorable, the hot tub was so nice, and the movie projector was great for just chilling! The whole vibe was just so cute, relaxing, and beautifully put together. It’s such lovely getaway they put together, and I’m so thankful they put so much effort into it! I love that a place like this exists. They even left us some snacks and coffee which was a nice touch. I felt comfortable with the amount of privacy we had and the neighborhood we were in, and they also had instructions available on how all the utilities work. Overall I would 100% book this place again, I highly recommend it!! Thank you guys for the amazing vacation!!"
4664,69,"Highly recommend this super cool spot!! Clean, cozy, & a perfect getaway for two."
4665,69,"Loved staying here, great space for two and loved the hot tub and large tv"
4666,69,"Super fun stay!! The space is done so nicely, very comfortable and relaxing."
4667,69,the best little get away with you and your partner the host is so nice he gave me and my girlfriend a bottle of wine for our anniversary
4668,69,Great getaway thanks
4669,69,"My fiancé and I stayed for our anniversary and we loved it! The host left a sweet note saying happy anniversary and a bottle of wine! There were snacks, coffee, water. It was very cozy, and we really enjoyed the projector and the hot tub. We’ve stayed in several places before with outdoor toilets and showers and these were the easiest and cleanest to use. Inside the dome is actually pretty spacious with a couple sitting areas. The area also feels safe which is a big plus for me when staying outside. We were hoping for relaxation and privacy and that is exactly what we got! Overall it was a 10/10!"
4670,69,This was a great place to stay and I would definitely recommend.
4671,69,"We had a great stay! we liked the cleanliness, how easy to use the shower, toilet, and hot tub were, and the thoughtful touches. super private and relaxing! we have already recommended to many!"
4672,69,Great place the bed was comfortable and the jacuzzi was on point!!! highly recommend :)
4673,69,"We stayed here for a quick staycation, and it was amazing! Everything is just as pictured. We loved the projector and the experience all around was fantastic. Matt replies quickly and is a great host."
4674,69,"Incredible stay! Host was very communicative, space was exactly as promised (even cooler in person) and we didn't want to leave. They really thought of everything - cupholders on the hot tub, normal plugs and USB chargers, creamer in the fridge for the Keurig coffee, etc. The place was extremely secluded with the wooden fence all the way around. We had no noise issues from the surrounding properties and didn't worry that they could possibly hear the TV projector going late at night. It poured rain the first night and we were so worried there would be a leak or we'd have trouble making it to the bathroom without getting soaked - but the tree coverage was great and the dome is completely insulated. The location is about an 8-minute drive to Belmont's Main Street and about 20 minutes to the Whitewater Center - both amazing places to spend your days while visiting the area. Couldn't recommend this place and host more!"
4675,69,"Super cute and Matthew provided some snacks and drinks which were a great touch. This is definitely a glamping situation. The bathroom sink, toilet, and shower are covered but pretty much outside but the shower and toilet are really easy to use (just watch the videos). The dome stayed surprisingly cool and the projector was great for watching a bedtime movie. Would definitely stay here again. Bring some bug spray if you wanna hangout outside!"
4676,69,My sister and I had a great time at this Airbnb. It was very private feeling and there were so many thoughtful touches.
4677,69,"Absolutely incredible!! This unique stay made for a weekend we will never forget! The pictures match the real life perfectly. The space was clean and private. Being surrounded by trees it felt like an amazing glamping experience! The only thing I would consider slightly unsatisfactory is the bed isn’t the most comfortable, I didn’t have issues sleeping but waking up my body was a little sore. That would not deter me from staying here again! Overall it was lovely stay and I would highly recommend to anyone visiting the Charlotte area!"
4678,69,This place is amazing! You will love it!
4679,69,Such a cute place! They really have thought of everything.
4680,69,"Such a dope spot! Amazing for mini staycation and a cute getaway. Hot tub is top notch, projector in the dome is a vibe! Recommended"
4681,69,Beautiful and relaxing place! As clean as it looks in the pictures. I recommend it 10/10!! We will definitely be back :).
4682,69,Incredible stay! We’re local to Charlotte but just wanted a staycation vibe for the weekend. This absolutely fit the bill. No need to worry about bugs or being too hot because of the dome enclosure. I felt completely safe and secure. The projector screen is huge. Lots of local restaurants to venture off to in the evening. My friends and family won’t stop asking me about it on Instagram lol
4683,69,"Matthew is the man.
Very respectful and accommodating.
All around a grade A host.
The whole space was even better than expected.
A true experience."
4684,69,We loved staying here! The dome was perfect for an evening getaway.
4685,69,This geodome was unique and so clean! I loved the outdoor shower. everything was great!!!
4686,69,This was an extraordinary place and they were the greatest host. Will definitely book again!
4687,69,We loved the dome and will be back. The hot tub was wonderful!
4688,69,"Truly a magical little space. The hosts were kind and responded quickly. The place was clean and super pleasant to stay in, so I very highly recommend staying at the dome!"
4689,69,We loved it! It was the perfect place to topped a weekend full of adventures! The place was cozy and functional! And ZERO mosquitos❤️
4690,69,"We had a great time! I was pleasantly surprised by how *clean* the toilet and bathroom area were especially, the dome itself was very cute. The AC did a great job of keeping it cool. I will mention that the bed might not be ideal for people with back problems or elderly - there aren't very many slats in the bed and the mattress corners kept falling through the frame if we sat in the bed instead of laying on it, and it was awkwardly slanted when we slept in it. Everything else was great, and Matthew was quick to respond to my questions!"
4691,69,Awesome place! Very clean and exactly as listed! I would definitely stay again.
4692,69,Very comfortable and enjoyable stay!
4693,69,"Fantastic location with a great host! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and plan to return!"
4694,69,"I can’t rave enough about how unique, relaxing, and beautiful of a stay I had!! The hosts responded in a timely fashion and were incredibly accommodating. I absolutely recommend this stay and will be back in the future!"
4695,69,"A magical place, super clean, cozy,
perfect for resting"
4696,69,Perfect!
4697,70,Great place! Went for a weekend getaway with my family and dogs. Plenty to do even in rainy cold weather! We fished paddle board played pool. The only downside was some minor cleanliness issues. Would come back.
4698,70,"Great location, great fishing, location was easy to find, definitely will rebook for another occasion."
4699,70,"This place was absolutely gorgeous and amazing! The bathroom was my favorite feature and of course the hot tub looking over the private lake and field full of deer.. My kids loved fishing off the dock and the playground. The only things we didn’t like was the bathroom door didn’t lock, there was not enough towels for everyone, and the place did not sleep 11 people even with the two twin air mattress but other than that this is a great place and will rent again when in the area..!!"
4700,70,Thank you so much for the review! We appreciate this so much and will definitely work to improve on those specific issues. Be sure to ♥ my listing to your Airbnb Wish List so you can find me easily next time you're in the area. We hope to host you again!
4701,70,"It was a great little spot for our family spring break vacation. Listing says 5 beds but there are only 4 and then a useable pack and play. The pond had decent amount of fish to keep the kids entertained but I recommend bringing your own fishing equipment like hooks etc because what they provided was too big for the fish there. Game room was a hit. The property manager, Amy, was very responsive and sent over handyman for fireplace right away when we couldn’t get it started. Overall we had a great time and location was very nice!"

4703,70,"This property was just the staycation that we needed. The property is peaceful and enchanting. The home was exactly as pictured. Beautifully decorated with many thoughtful accents. There were numerous games and activities for us to enjoy. I personally loved the book collection that you would find in seating areas, throughout the home. An awesome way to relax.
And i cant say enough about Benjamin and Amy! They were super responsive and helpful and made our stay a breeze. We will definitely be returning during the warmer months."
4704,70,Thank you so much for the glowing review! Be sure to ♥ my listing to your Airbnb Wish List so you can find me easily next time you're in the area. We are glad you enjoyed your stay!
4705,70,I loved the house we stayed in and the pond out back was great and very clean. The hot tub was left dirty from the last guests who didn’t use it properly so we weren’t able to use it. The paddleboat was great too and we would return if we are ever in the area again!
4706,70,Hi Jenna! Thank you for leaving a review! We truly apologize in regards to the hot tub being out of commission for your stay. We hope to host you again in the near future!
4707,70,"The location is lovely and the main house is wonderful. We were disappointed to show up to trash in the fire pit and the pool room trashed with dirty dishes and games everywhere,."
4708,70,Hi Maddy! We truly do apologize for this unacceptable situation. Our team has been working thoroughly to make sure this does not happen again. We hope to host you again in the future!
4709,70,Great place for a group to hang out and disconnect a bit! We loved the space and all the amenities it came with. Would stay here again without a doubt.

4724,70,Thank you so much for this glowing review! Be sure to ♥ my listing to your Airbnb Wish List so you can find me easily next time! We would love to host you again in the future.
4725,70,"This house and the land are beautiful. There were lots of activities in the house and game room, everything was clean, and the house is well stocked. Our only complaint was that the sleeping arrangements are not very abundant, sleeping 8 adults was very difficult. Overall this place is fantastic and we will definitely return! Benjamin is extremely helpful and responsive."
4726,70,"Everything was great! Benjamin was quick to respond, and the lake was absolutely beautiful! Awesome house, completely equipped and so so cozy!"
4727,70,Great time
4728,70,Lovely stay! Plenty of recreational equipment to enjoy!
4729,70,"BEST of the BEST, This has been my favorite Airbnb to date. The home was warm and inviting, every detail was taken care of. The home was stocked with everything you can need and then some. This host thought of all the small details that made us feel welcomed and at home. I wish I could give a higher rating because it is deserved, I will want to stay here again and again, it is that fabulous. Great job"
4730,70,"Fantastic place to stay for quiet and solitude. The only thing missing was a cutting board. Otherwise, kitchen very well stocked with all cooking and baking necessities. Loved the hot tub!"
4731,70,Benjamin's place goes above and beyond all expectations. The house was super clean and decorated beautifully. There was deer in the yard every day. Benjamin was super helpful and quick to respond. Check in was super smooth as well. Highly recommend staying here!
4732,70,"This AirBnB was absolutely beautiful and exactly what we were hoping for. The amenities are bountiful, the area is private and serene, and nature is surrounding you. Even though we had an issue upon arrival, Benjamin immediately responded and so did his property manager and they worked to get the issue resolved for us. We look forward to visiting again."
4733,70,Perfection
4734,70,I can not say enough good things about this property. I came here with two of my girlfriends and the entire time we enjoyed ourselves. We felt safe staying by ourselves which is very important!! The house was 10/10 clean. The property was just as beautiful in person as it’s photos. Everything about this exceeded my expectations. I ended up extending one night because of how much I enjoyed this home. Benjamin was amazing and helped with every question I had. Check in was easy. I took advantage of the hot tub & fireplace. I will definitely be coming back.
4735,70,Benjamin’s place was such a wonderful place to relax and refresh. Benjamin was responsive and helpful to us when we had questions. We’d definitely stay here again!
4736,70,"beautiful property, would stay again"
4737,70,"What a beautiful spot! The mist rising off the pond in the morning, the deer and woodpeckers and herons and ducks, the rising hills, the changing leaves, the welcoming wrap around porch, the varied textures and weaves of the comfy blankets, the thoughtful kitchen, the cozy couch, the soft beds and fluffy quilts...our weekend was so special! Walks in nature, paddling on the water, relaxing in the hot tub. and just basking in everyone's company--unforgettable! So thankful for our stay!"
4738,70,"This property is perfect! It may have been our favorite airbnb of all time. The seclusion was perfect, and the proximity to our home in Durham made it an easy get-away. The hot tub was the perfect temperature, and it was lovely waking up to the view of the pond/lake. The house was classy and comfortable and provided plenty of space for us to spread out. Our only complaint is that we couldn't stay for longer;(."
4739,70,Thanks so much Alec. You were lovely guests to host! And I hope that you'll be able to come out and stay with us again soon.
4740,70,What can I say about 25 peaceful acres with deer running all around the yard and a beautiful pound. The stay was absolutely amazing. I would recommend this stay to anyone wanting to just relax and get away for the everyday hustle and bustle of every day life. And what a place for a weekend getaway with the wife. Six stars out of five…
4741,70,"very nice place quiet,relaxed
i really liked the house and the lake
the only bad thing is that it only has one bathroom
everything else excellent"
4742,70,Thank you for the ★★★★★ review!
4743,70,"Beautiful cabin. We spent 2 beautiful days with our pets.
She returned gladly"
4744,72,"This was such a fun place. It was exactly like what the listing described. Really quiet neighborhood and very clean. We would definitely stay here again, and will recommend this place to anyone who asks. So if you plan on visiting Carolina Beach, do yourself a favor and Staty here."
4745,72,"We brought our family of 3 back again, is there any more that needs to be said? :)"
4746,72,Great place a few blocks to the beach. We had a lovely visit.
4747,72,"Wonderful place to stay! Great location, very tidy, and had everything we needed!"
4748,72,"This is my new favorite spot at Carolina Beach! It was adorable, comfortable, convenient and very clean. We will be back!"
4749,72,"Easy check in, and good communication. Place exceeded expectations. Definitely worth it!!"
4750,72,"Great place to stay. Super easy and quick walk to the beach. Quiet area, too. Really cute house very clean and had everything you needed."
4751,72,"My fiancé and I stayed here over a weekend in March, and it was a lovely stay. Not only was it very affordable compared to surrounding prices, but it was clean, beautiful, quiet, and very walkable. We loved being 3 blocks from the beach access for sunrise walks. Charles and Vicky were proactively responsive to any requests we had, and accommodated us whenever they could. We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend."
4752,72,"Perfect spot, cozy, modern & minimal. Great location. Right near the boardwalk and restaurants, easy beach access, all walkable. Just like the pictures. So comfortable, felt private enough even with another tenant in the downstairs apartment. Definitely the most clean and fully stocked with amenities of the airbnb's I have stayed at so far. Thank you guys so much!"
4753,72,Wonderful relaxing stay!!
4754,72,"Was everything we needed and more for a weekend getaway to the beach! Very cozy and clean! Great location to restaurants, the boardwalk & of course the beach!!"
4755,72,Really cute place in a really convenient location! Definitely coming back when the weather is a bit warmer :)
4756,72,"Loved the space! So beautifully decorated and super clean. We were able to walk to the beach, boardwalk area and the lake in a few minutes! Definitely recommend!!"
4757,72,"We loved this place! Great location, so cute, and we hope to be back one day!"
4758,72,"We really enjoyed our stay. The weather was too cold to do much outdoors, so the place was a nice, cozy getaway. The space had everything we needed and it was convenient to many good restaurants and the beach."
4759,72,the fully stocked kitchen was really helpful and it was all very clean and nice!
4760,72,"Great place close to restaurants, coffee shops and the beach. Very clean and comfortable!"
4761,72,I would highly recommend! Everything was clean! Great location! Great price!
4762,72,Great stay. Hosts were friendly and responsive.
4763,72,"This place was super cute for our little family getaway on thanksgiving! We enjoyed exploring the area and was close to the beach, coffee shops and dining. Please was very clean and accurately described!"
4764,72,"The place was very beautiful. I greatly enjoyed the beachy feel and the warm, cozy ambiance of the place.

Would love to come back."
4765,72,THANKS SO MUCH!
4766,72,Amazing place! So cute and peaceful. I loved how close it was to the lake and beach. Had everything I needed for the week.
4767,72,Great stay!
4768,72,Such a cute little spot! We loved staying here. The location was perfect for us and it had everything we could’ve needed for our stay.
4769,72,"Charles’s place was perfect! We booked an impromptu trip to Carolina Beach and needed to find a place quickly.

We were delighted to find such a modern and clean space right near where we wanted to be. It was the perfect place for us to stay and such a great value. Thank you Charles!"
4770,72,Great place for two people and our dog! It was clean and had everything we needed. We enjoyed a short walk to the beach and sitting outside on the little deck. We would be happy to stay here again.
4771,72,"Clean, bright spacious area with all the amenities. Cute as the pictures."
4772,72,Amazing spot! I stopped in here while I was in town for work and couldn’t have asked for a better place to rest up in the evenings. Super close to the beach and lots of great food.
4773,72,Adorable cottage on 2nd floor! Photos are very accurate. Love the design/decor. Great spot if you like to walk! Good restaurants nearby and hosts were super responsive. Highly recommend!
4774,72,"Cute, clean and great location!"
4775,72,We had a wonderful time! Loved the location and the clean and bright space :)
4776,72,Highly recommend this location for a cozy getaway. My wife and I went for a quick two day trip and it was the perfect spot. The unit was spotless and the amenities within the unit gave my wife all the aesthetic feels she could have. A really easy 5 minute walk to the beach and boardwalk as well as the walking trail around the lake right next to the home was perfect for our little family. Cannot wait for our next stay
4777,72,"Great trip! airbnb was perfect, close to the beach and restaurants. Very well done, clean and easy to communicate with hosts!"
4778,72,Such a beautiful place! Very comfortable and cozy! Location is perfect for a quick walk to the beach! This will be my go to spot next time I come back!
4779,72,"This is a great location at a great value; the beach is a 5 minute walk with sidewalks all the way. Everything is within walking distance, really. And it’s worth noting the beach access in Hamlet has showers and a public restroom which was a huge game changer for us.

The space is CLEAN, the linens are sparkling white and extremely cozy- the mattresses are comfy well. There are plenty of blankets and pillows. The kitchen was stocked with all the coffee needs and all your cooking basics. The water pressure is impressive which is always a toss up in beach homes. Also plenty of lounging spaces: the front sunroom, the balcony, the ground floor space- a lot was done with a small space.

10/10 recommended; this spot is a gem!"
4780,72,"My husband, dog and I had a great time here. There’s a small park nearby where our dog made lots of new friends. The location is great because so many bars, restaurants, and shops are within walking distance. The separate and entrance and deck were great to have a little privacy."
4781,72,"Great spot for a quick getaway and just a short walk from the beach. Loved that we were able to bring our pups and enjoy a weekend together. Overall, wonderful experience!"
4782,72,Charles is a wonderful host and the Airbnb was a great experience. Hope to stay again soon!
4783,72,"Cute place, nice and clean! Really enjoyed my stay!"
4784,72,Beautifully renovated apartment roughly a 5 min walk to the public access point on the beach! Charles was very thoughtful in setting up the space to be dog friendly. Our pup and us greatly enjoyed the location and rental!
4785,72,"We loved our stay here! It was our first time visiting Carolina Beach and we will definitely be back! The Surf Lodge is perfect for a couple or a family with young kids. We loved being able to cook dinner at the house each night, but being close enough to walk to restaurants if we wanted. Being so close to the beach was wonderful!"
4786,72,"Great place ! We had a lot of fun , the beach was beautiful"
4787,72,Great place!
4788,72,great location and the renovations was very well done. Cozy place with a beach vibe.
4789,72,Had a great time staying here. The location is perfect for access to the beach
4790,72,Beautiful space. Location was amazing. Hosts were always available if needed. Definitely recommend!
4791,72,"This was the perfect place for my husband and I and our two (large-ish) dogs. The beach is ~3 blocks away, a very easy walk; 1 block away from the lake with paved trail; within very easy walking distance to restaurants; and ~6 or so blocks to a really great dog park. The upstairs apartment has a long-ish tiled mudroom, a good-sized sitting room with kitchen, large bathroom, and large bedroom with a futon and queen bed. We were very comfortable. There's also a 2-seater dining set out on the porch, and two Adirondaks below in the shade. The fenced in area is small, but totally sufficient for quick potty runs, and there's a hose to rinse everything down (and get off the sand) as well. There's a small dishwasher, full size fridge, full size oven, and plenty of coffee-making paraphernalia. We really enjoyed our stay there. Charles and Vicky were extremely responsive; we had a few internet issues and they were super fast in helping us resolve it."
4792,72,The Surf Lodge was a perfect stay for our weekend getaway! Walkable distance to everything and such a cute quaint beach vibe. Vicki and Charles were very responsive and helpful. Hope to stay here again in the future!
4793,72,"FANTASTIC location!! Walking distance to shops, restaurants, the beach, and the lake! Charles was very responsive to my questions, and the house manager is wonderful! This is a perfect getaway for a couple! We brought our cavalier with us, and she had a blast because we could take her to the beach after 5:00 and or walk around the lake anytime! The place is equipped with everything you need! Great stay!"
4794,72,Awesome stay! This place is exactly as advertised. Great location. We’ll definitely be back for another visit.
4795,72,Beautiful space! Great walking distance to everything! Hoping to rent again!
4796,72,"Amazing Airbnb- the aesthetics, location & host were perfection. I will say if you are traveling with a baby beware the floors are older/noisy and the below unit you can hear door slams/walking. Charles was so kind to let the neighbors below know we had a baby sleeping and to be mindful. We were right behind Hang Ten, an amazing spot to eat and a few more feet is beach enterance. The location is PRIME. Decor was adorable & I couldn’t stop taking photos of it all. Would stay here again. Thanks Charles!"
4797,72,Great old beach cottage charm with modern updates. Great location.
4798,72,"This was such a cute rental! The pictures online actually make the rental seem smaller than it is once you are there in person. It is definitely not a multi-family rental by any means, but it is quaint, updated, chic, clean, and accommodates your needs. There were plenty of towels and starter items. I liked having a private entrance and small gated area for my dogs to use the restroom (they won’t potty on a leash). I recommend bringing non-stick cooking spray if you plan on cooking. Other than that, I have no complaints. Thank you for the stay, for answering any questions that we had and we look forward to staying with you again!"
4799,72,"Location was perfect. Could easily walk to bars, restaurants and of course, the beach. The bed was very comfy and all the decor was cute. Definitely a perfect stay for a small family or couple."
4800,72,"Very clean, exactly as advertised."
4801,72,"Beautiful, comfortable, super clean, home! Loved the outdoor space as well!"
4802,72,"The Surf Shack was such a lovely place for our family beach vacation. It’s the entire top floor of a two-story house, plus lots of outdoor space, so there is plenty of room for the kids to play and for grownups to relax. Charles has thought of everything—well-appointed kitchen, house thoroughly stocked with Public Goods products, ample and comfy linens, and lovely modern furnishings, including tons of little details that make this place feel like home. The neighborhood is a quiet street, very close to the main road through town—we didn’t use our car at all during our stay, as everything is within walking distance—the beach, the boardwalk, restaurants, a lovely park, etc. Tuesday morning seems to be trash day and cut the grass day across the street day, and so yes it’s very loud very early (I saw this mentioned in another review and felt like it should be addressed), and it doesn’t last long and it’s only once a week—totally not a thing under the control of the owner of the Surf Shack! Ok, just had to clear that up. This place was a little oasis for us—highly recommend this property and owner Charles. He was so responsive to us from the time we booked until we checked out, answering all of our questions quickly and thoroughly.. You will love your stay here! Book it now…you know you want to."
4803,72,Great location and impeccably decorated. Our small family enjoyed the proximity to the boardwalk and the beach while being far enough away to relax after sunset.
4804,72,"Great location, cute decor, easy check-in! We would definitely stay here again!"
4805,72,AMAZING location and relaxing ambiance! This is the perfect place for couples to escape with their fur baby! 1 block from the lake trail & 3 easy blocks to the beach! We had a great time and will definitely be back!
4806,72,"Clean, comfy and conveniently located to restaurants and the beach. I recommend this place and would stay again."
4807,72,Great place to stay. It’s located upstairs but is beautiful and definitely would suggest this location.
4808,72,We loved it.
4809,72,"We had a great stay at Charles' place! Perfect for a quick girls weekend. The 2nd floor unit was beautifully decorated and surprisingly spacious. Very easy check-in. Beds were comfortable and kitchen was quite well-stocked with a dishwasher and nice appliances. Very close to the beach access, restaurants and grocery stores but also far enough away from the busy boardwalk area that it was nice and quiet- best of both! The only thing it didn't have was a dining room table, but we ate our meals out on the patio outside (luckily it wasn't too hot). We will be back!"
4810,72,Charles place was very clean and had many small detail touches which made it great. The location was very close within walking distance to a lot of stuff. We stayed in Unit 2 which was upstairs and it wasn’t private due to the unit beside us. I was awakened every morning with some kind of noise without fail whether it was a trash truck or someone cutting their non existent grass at 6-7 am. Overall we were happy with the stay but the price of this unit was higher than it should have been due to excessive fees applied on top of the nightly rate. You might as well say 400 a night. I don’t believe I would stay here again.
4811,72,Thx for the feedback! Wish the Airbnb fees were lower but that is all out of our control unfortunately…as it’s set by Airbnb and collected by them directly. And yes the trash trucks can come early at the beginning of the week sometimes too…
4812,72,"Adorable unit within walking distance to the beach. Very clean, cozy, and well decorated. Charles was quick to reply to my inquiries. Recommended for a single or couple."
4813,72,"Great space. It was clean and a very quick walk to beach access and downtown. Charles was a great host, and responded very quickly to any needs/questions."
4814,72,"Great location, great place to stay at. and very clean."
4815,72,This upstairs apartment is very cute with great interior design. You are able to walk a few blocks to the beach and a few blocks to restaurants and bars. We had a great time!
4816,72,We had a wonderful stay! The house is a very easy walk to the beach and close to other shops and restaurants. We enjoyed visiting the state park and a brewery (Good Hops) close by (30 min walk or short drive). The house was clean and well stocked. We would definitely stay again!
4817,72,Charles' place was super clean and a really quick walk to the beach. We even walked to the boardwalk. It wasn't a far drive from anything and write across the road from the park. It's a very quiet neighborhood and me and my fiancé loved staying here!
4818,72,Great place to stay!
4819,72,"My boyfriend and I spent 3 nights here and it was perfect for us. The apartment was very clean and it was decorated super cute with lots of attention to detail.

Loved that it was walking distance to the beach. The bed was very comfortable. There were two closets which was nice so we could each hang our things. There was a washer and dryer, and a dishwasher as well. We also appreciated the Ninja blender in the kitchen and used it to make smoothies.

The only thing I can think of that could have made our experience even better was if there were some beach towels and maybe beach chairs supplied for us to use. We flew here from Colorado so we didn’t have our own. Nothing a quick trip to Walmart couldn’t fix :)

Thanks for a great stay!"
4820,72,"We enjoyed our stay here, it was very clean and such a cute little place. We will definitely be back."
4821,72,"The apartment is convenient to the beach, boardwalk and restaurants. The modern decor, and attention to detail to all the kitchen supplies, bed linens and bathroom accessories were perfect and appreciated, comfortable and perfect."
4822,72,"Perfect location and very clean and well equipped for stay. Neighborhood is great. We were a little confused to find out it was only the top floor, as the description says it’s the ‘entire home’ and is also essentially connected to the house next door. Overall a very nice place, but if you require/are looking for privacy not ideal as owners were in/out doing construction next door"
4823,72,What a neat little place. Close enough to the beach yet far enough away from the hustle bustle and crowds. Enjoyed coffee time and wine down in private little seating areas. Very responsive host and hostess. Would definitely return!
4824,72,"Great Airbnb, had everything you need for a weekend trip. Super close to the beach. Would definitely stay here again."
4825,72,"Came to check out the area to possibly relocate. The spot was perfect. It was an easy walk to the beachand shops and restaurants. The house was very clean and really well supplied (kitchen staples, bathroom supplies, etc.)"
4826,72,Such a cute place!
4827,72,"Great place for our respite. Nice and clean! We enjoyed having the beach so close!
Also, having our dog with us was a plus!"
4828,72,"You should know if you book, this place is BEAUTIFUL. It’s newly renovated, the set up and decorate was amazing as well as the outside furniture. We were able to use a lot of the things they had there. Charles was also excellent on communication and responded very fast. The location itself was also amazing, we walked to the beach and the local restaurants instead of driving, and it took maybe 5-10 minutes depending on where we went. We would definitely look at staying there in the future again."
4829,72,Great lil place with everything needed during your stay. The hosts are quick to respond with. Will definitely be back!
4830,73,What a peaceful and relaxing stay we had in the Peaceful Valley surrounded by pristine nature and expressions of creativity everywhere! It was a pleasure having a chat with our host upon arrival. We hadn't imagined ourselves playing Ms. Pacman on this trip but not did we fun doing that! Great stay!
4831,73,thanks for the kind review.
4832,73,"I loved my stay this past weekend. The treehouse was clean, the sounds of nature were amazing, and there were great walking paths throughout the property. Our hosts are wonderfully creative people!"
4833,73,thank you...tell warren to watch gamechanger on netflix...
4834,73,"me and the Mrs's had the most wonderful time in the treehouse with the ladybugs. beautiful scenery, lake and some magnificent artwork. hosts and the dog were delightful and there was plenty of hikes and nearby nature to enjoy in the spring. to any future renters worried about the treehouse temperature in the spring, was very cosy, with the heating barely on. I couldn't recommend this place enough and hope to return soon."
4835,73,"thank you for the kind review, come back anytime you need to get away from the lab!!"
4836,73,"This was our 2nd trip to the Tiny Treehouse, and just as before, it did not disappoint. Everything was clean in the house, with well-maintained, fun, walking trails. Judith, Henry, and Ladybug are friendly and hospitable. It's truly a magical, peaceful getaway, and we hope to make this a yearly visit!"
4837,73,thanks for the 5 star review....you are 5 star guests!!
4838,73,Henry and Judith were amazing host! The place is beautiful along with the property! I loved being able to just walk outside and enjoy all the little specialties they have out there! Truly a great weekend celebrating me and my boyfriends one year!
4839,73,bella and her boyfriend played house over a long weekend. both were very polite and respectful of our place and us. they seemed to have fun.
4840,73,"This place is an absolute dream! The views, artwork, owners, and overall vibes leave me feeling recharged and inspired each time I visit. Perfect for creatives, couples, and anybody looking for a safe place to explore nature."
4841,73,"thank you for the kind review and it was a pleasure to talk shop to you over the weekend and show you all the artwork in the house. you are on the right way, we only wish you'd live a little closer...."
4842,73,"It was great having a full kitchen and bathroom, and to still get the treehouse experience. It is remote, but the directions were very helpful and we didn’t have a problem finding the Airbnb, even at night."
4843,73,thank you
4844,73,"We spent 4 days at the treehouse, and spent most of our time in the beautiful trails created by Henry & Judith.
The location is PERFECT for couples looking to spend quality time together without the interference of cell phones, or humans, and gave us the privacy we were looking for.
Wi-Fi was fast, and available if we needed it, and the place was fully equipped with everything you can think of. It stormed pretty bad on our way back from emerald hollow mine, and they were so thoughtful to check on us and make sure we were okay.
They definitely care about their customers, and go above and beyond to make sure your stay is perfect.
I did not see a single bug inside, it was very clean and easy to tidy up before leaving.

Thank you & we can’t wait to come back again."
4845,73,"thank you for you kind review, we are glad you were safe and yes, we do care very much about our guests - we love to host!"
4846,73,"Everything from the cozy treehouse and beautiful landscape, to the one of a kind artwork and beautiful hosts, are nothing short of magical!
Judith & Henry are super warm and welcoming upon arrival. The property is soul quenching. The way the morning sun reflects off of the pond is the perfect way to wake up every morning. (Not to mention our daily visits from their adorable dog Ladybug)
The treehouse is filled with fun things like instruments, boardgames, puzzles, books, a dartboard, Pac-man machine and other knickknacks that I spent hours playing with. Everything was super clean. The kitchen had everything we could possibly need and the freshest tap water I’ve ever had. The bed was more comfortable than my own, and the heater/AC both worked great.
The artwork incorporated not only in the treehouse but throughout the property is as unique as it is mesmerizing. Be sure to walk the property to its entirety to fully grasp the beauty and unmatched aesthetic. If you are looking for a place to disconnect from the world and be one with nature, this is the place for you!
This definitely won’t be the last time we’ll be visiting Judith, Henry & Ladybug, as this listing provided us a great experience and even greater friends!"
4847,73,This review was as nice as this couple is...we decided that we will adopt them (even though they don't know about it yet) and we all will live happily ever after in our magical valley...
4848,73,"The treehouse reminded me of a cabin in the woods with all necessities covered and unique, interesting decor. The description is very accurate, so please don't be surprised if you see a spider or flying insect. I saw a couple of both (caught and released). I honestly thought I would see more, was pleasantly surprised that I didn't. My Honda Accord had no trouble on the gravel road, but it might have been a bit tricky if it had been raining. The property is wonderfully beautiful. Loved watching the birds and butterflies flitting from flower to flower while eating breakfast. A hummingbird came right up to the window to check us out. Unfortunately, we weren't able to fully explore the property. But every time I went outside I saw something new. Loved the giant hand and the birdhouse made from a boot. Literally too many things to mention. Very strong internet connection. From the moment we arrived, Lady Bug and Judith made us feel welcome. Wish I had had more of an opportunity to speak with Judith and Henry, but the interaction I did have was easy and relaxed. It's obvious they enjoy hosting, and they want their guests to have a wonderful time."
4849,73,thanks for the very nice review...also we ourselves drive a scion xb and have had NEVER any troubles rain or shine or even light snow with our roads and driveway!
4850,73,"The tree house has been my favorite airbnb to stay in so far. It was certainly beyond my expectations. Such a CUTE, peaceful spot to stay. I loved that they allowed you the opportunity to swim in the pond and they had a walking trail. The scenery is so peaceful and beautiful. I think my favorite thing about it was the fresh spring water, it tasted so good! Book your next peaceful stay at the tree house, you will not be disappointed!"
4851,73,thank you for your kind review and for leaving the tiny tree house spotless!
4852,73,Henry and Judith were awesome! They made us feel welcome and made it possible for me to make progress on a book I'm writing! What a great place!
4853,73,Wonderful
4854,73,thank you
4855,73,"Fantastic place, very unique house and property with welcoming hosts. Absolutely beautiful area and lots of hiking and things to do!"
4856,73,thank you
4857,73,"This place is the magical stay in the woods that you've been looking for. The property is 25 acres deep in the mountains with a pond you can swim in, trails to hike, and lots of whimsical touches with art everywhere. There is the ""chakra walk"" with hand-sculpted pieces where you can play a steel drum, a sacred temple you can get to by crossing a creek on a beam, a trampoline nestled in the woods, a super cool tree house with full amenities, and a serious boho vibe before it was an ""aesthetic"" but a way of life. The hosts are fabulous! Very down to earth and likely to engage you in a philosophical conversation or talk about their garden, their solar panel rig, and the state of the world. Come here if you want long dark quiet nights, drinking coffee at the pier next to the pond, and need deep refreshment. Highly recommend!"
4858,73,we are deeply honored when a guest takes her time and writes such a detailed and awesome review!! She was a great guest.....we certainly want her to come back and talk lots more....
4859,73,"We appreciated the opportunity to visit such a peaceful and relaxing place. If you get the opportunity to visit you won't be disappointed. Can't wait to return, thank you again."
4860,73,"Henry and Judith were wonderful! They’re super friendly and have a wonderful dog! They’re property is extremely peaceful and beautiful. The trails are all nicely kept and easily marked. They even provide a map of their property and trails. They’re trails have some wonderful gems throughout.
The tree house is already equipped with so much—dish soap, bug spray, etc. There isn’t any cell service, which is honestly wonderful, but they do have wifi so we were able to get our GPS set each time before we’d leave.
I definitely recommend anyone looking for a relaxing mountain get away to stay here."
4861,73,"thanks for the awesome review, really glad you had such a wonderful time...."
4862,73,"Some Airbnbs are convenient to your destination, and some Airbnbs *are* the destination. On this remote mountain in Millers Creek, Henry and Judith have built a beautiful thing. I will always remember my weekend at the treehouse. It's gorgeous and whimsical, with plenty to do and see on the property--artfully curated with hiking trails, chill spots, walking meditations, sculptures, a trampoline, a slackline, a pond, and more. Henry and Judith were gracious and communicative hosts, who made our stay even more fun. Thank you so much, Judith, Henry, and Ladybug!"
4863,73,"thanks for the great review, you GOT the place and what we wanted to do here. it was a real pleasure to host you both and thanks for the cookies!!!"
4864,73,My brother and I came down to the peaceful valley for the weekend just for a fun bonding experience and to just get away from home! We both had a beautiful time. Between the trails and swimming in the pond to all of the beautiful art all around- this place is just magical. Henry and Judith are the kindest people and are so helpful. Judith even helped us with a fire for s’mores and they were always just a doorbell ring away. The place was super tidy yet so cozy. They even tried to think of things for us to do when we seemed a little bored. Ladybug was such a sweet surprise coming to see us everyday. We soaked up everything we saw and left feeling so cleansed and just happy. This place will truly leave a mark on you!
4865,73,"well, if you both are ever up for adoption you can come here to peaceful valley...you both were a treasure and we loved how you ambled in our garden and appreciated everything. stay as you both are...you are perfect!!!"
4866,73,"Henry and Judith were great hosts and instantly made you feel welcome in their tree house. The only downside to our stay was that the aircondition in the bedroom was loud, which made it hard to get a good night's sleep. It may be something to consider if you are staying there in the hot summer months. All in all we had a great stay though!"
4867,73,"we wish the guests would have let us know about the a/c...we have a spare in the valley in case one of the three a/c's die and could have swapped it out in about 5 minutes. A shame that they didn't say anything to us but put it in the reviews, which is bad for us...well the a/c is swapped out now...their loss..."
4868,73,"Henry and Judith truly have a very special place they are sharing with the world! They are incredible hosts and we will most definitely be wanting to visit again and bring our two boys. Everything was clean, no problem checking in, shower was great, fresh spring water, A/C worked great, comfy bed for 2, amazing artwork all around the property, not to mention the amazing scenery and affordable price. Truly worth the stop if youre looking to get away in the mountains and find some peace."
4869,73,"you forgot to mention KT tape...ha, ha...thanks for the detailed review!!! Can't wait to have you back or us visiting you!!"
4870,73,"We had such a lovely time! The pond is excellent to swim in, and there's nice trails around the property. The treehouse itself is just adorable!"
4871,73,thanks for the kind review.
4872,73,"Henry and Judith are amazing hosts! They welcomed us and made us feel at home. We could not have asked for a better place to spend a long weekend and relax being immersed in art and nature. The house was great with so many interesting things added in furnishings and décor, every room had something fun! Being able to walk the trails, check out all the art and sculptures and enjoy a relaxing paddle on the boat around the pond just made the trip even better. We highly recommend staying here and can't wait until we can get back!"
4873,73,thanks for the great review...maybe next time we can star watch together...we also have a big telescope on the balcony!! see you in the fall....with pinky and ...the other one....
4874,73,Loved it all so much! Beautiful art and a beautiful place. Henry and Judith are extremely sweet and helpful. Definitely recommend! : )
4875,73,thanks and happy travels you two....
4876,73,"Henry and judith's place was absolutely beautiful, me and my boyfriend stayed for the weekend and couldn't have been more happy with the experience. if you're looking for a place to escape from the hustle and bustle, this is it. we had to attend a wedding during our stay with Henry and judith and it was so nice to be able to come back here and just breathe, relax, & separate from the outside world. there is NO cell phone service here, and that's probably the best part 😉"
4877,73,"Yes, your are right, even though we have one of the highest wifi speeds in the country our cell service is very spotty - depends on the carrier - some people do have service some don't...and we like it that way and are glad you did too! After all, this place is for relaxation, relaxation, relaxation..."
4878,73,Such a beautiful place to get away from it all! The treehouse was so cozy and felt like a dream. I really enjoyed looking out the windows overlooking their pond. I also loved climbing the latter to go to sleep. We spent most of our days out hiking and enjoying nature. It was nice to come back to the treehouse and eat dinner and relax. I definitely recommend staying here. Thanks Henry and Judith!
4879,73,thanks for the kind review.
4880,73,"I have nothing but great things to say about my stay. If you are looking for a nice place to relax and take in the nature around you, I 100% recommend!"
4881,73,thanks and all the best up north...
4882,73,This place is truly special. Henry and Judith are amazing hosts and made sure that we had everything we needed. If you are looking to connect with nature this place is perfect for you.
4883,73,"thanks, you took the weather in stride...peaceful valley in sunshine is a lot better still..."
4884,73,"This is a beautiful artistic home that offers the environment to unwind and relax with a beautiful view of the mountains with a pond to swim or just meditate.

Henry & Judith are a wonderful couple to have meaningful discussions with. Their homes are a display of art and experience from their travels. You will surely enjoy the chance to meditate and relax at this place."
4885,73,thank you for the kind review and we also enjoyed talking with you and wish you well changing this world for the better...
4886,73,This is the most amazing place I have ever been. Thank you Judith and Henry for an amazing escape! Namaste
4887,73,"thanks, glad you got it....don't worry about the butter - it was left behind by another guest...happy trails..."
4888,73,Great place to stay. Very remote and private.
4889,73,"Our second trip to the Peaceful Valley was just as amazing as the first time. We loved every minute of our visit and hope to come back every year or even sooner! The treehouse is so thoughtfully appointed and clean with a quirky charm that is hard to find. The hosts, Henry and Judith, are kind and welcoming, and their dog Ladybug will steal your heart! We were delighted to see the new art installations created by our talented hosts. It is so fun to explore the woods and come across their handmade signs and surprise art installations. This place makes us feel truly transported! It is like living inside an artists imagination/installation temporarily. The bed is comfy, the kitchen is well equipped, the views are amazing, and the peace and quiet is beyond!"
4890,73,"thanks again for being such great guests and you know you are always welcome back...sorry to have missed you in the morning, henry wanted to show you his new kraken syfy painting series...well there is always a next time. be well friends henry, judith and ladybug"
4891,73,"Cant say enough about how amazing the place and the hosts are. Beautiful property, mad cool tree house, insanely lovely hosts, lovebug dog. I wish I took advantage of all of the beauty and nature I was in but I let work consume me. I must return again and leave my computer at home. I left a big piece of my heart there and can’t thank Judith, Henry and Ladybug enough for being so friendly, kind, caring, hospitable, etc. I could go on and on and on. I left there with a smile and my heart was full."
4892,73,we hope that you can let work become a lesser part of your life and come back to really enjoy this place! thanks for being such an easy guest...and ladybug is missing her daily treats...
4893,73,"Henry and Judith are wonderful hosts. We stayed in the Treehouse and it was perfect. The space is really cozy…. Very comfortable for a small house.
The property is beautiful and they have some really great trails available.
Great spot for a getaway. Highly recommend getting in as soon as possible… you’ll want to spend as much time as you can at this spot. :)"
4894,73,"Great location with amazing people, stayed in the tree house and it was amazing. Between the lake, wooded paths, outdoor trampoline, and meditation spots this is a perfect escape to nature. Both the hosts and the property are welcoming and full of personality."
4895,73,absolutely amazing place. Would highly recommend
4896,73,Glad you liked to meet ken and the rest of us....
4897,73,"This is one of the BEST experiences you will ever have. We read the many, many positive reviews but we’re not prepared to love this place as much as we did. We wanted to stay forever. The place abounds with thoughtful, unique and artful touches. It is like being a kid again exploring and discovering the trails and sculptures and endless creativity these two amazing individuals have poured into their gorgeous surroundings. It rained the whole time we were there and weirdly we could not have been happier. The treehouse is so cozy filled with great books and movies. We loved making meals and just taking in the beautiful views. We were thrilled whenever Ladybug the dog paid a visit to us there or joined us on a hike. My boyfriend is a musician and he throughly enjoyed the instruments in the treehouse as well as the large sculptures that he was able to interact with. The place was super clean and so quiet and peaceful like you cannot imagine. We were in an almost dream like state . This place is a dream! I only wish we could have stayed longer. Judith and Henry were so lovely and made us feel so welcome. We were so intrigued to meet them after seeing all of their art. The drive out to Peaceful Valley was amazing too. From start to finish we could not have been any happier. Big thanks to Judith , Henry and Ladybug ."
4898,73,it always gives us a warm and fuzzy feeling when we have guests who 'get' our place. we really want to share what we have here and after reading your review we know all the work is worth it....THANK YOU!
4899,73,This is a wonderful place if you want to get away for peace and solitude. It is also a great base for exploring the surrounding Blue Ridge Parkway area. Henry and Judith are very interesting and made me feel at home in the appropriately named Pleasant Valley.
4900,73,"happy travels in the future, you were a perfect guest!"
4901,73,"Such a fun and quirky place to stay! We thoroughly enjoyed our time. There is beautiful art everywhere and so much to explore on the property, from trails with hidden gems of art, a trampoline, zip line, pond, and lots of peace with nature. It has all the closeness with nature that you’d get camping, but has some of the modern conveniences and comforts of a cabin. It’s a fun adventure and we’ll definitely be back. Ladybug is such a sweet dog and wins our hearts as our favorite AirBnB pup ever! Henry and Judith are awesome hosts and have created a heck of a fun and unique AirBnB experience.

Some pointers:
Follow the directions Henry sends you, and do not use GPS. GPS takes you to the opposite side of the mountain. Take a screen shot of them and save on your phone, before you get there. Cell service is non-existent for a good 20 minutes before you arrive and on property. (They have WiFi at the treehouse, which works great.)

Don’t be turned off by the composting toilet! I’m a very squeamish person and was a little nervous, but it’s surprisingly comfortable and easy and definitely not gross.

Get out and explore the property! So much to discover. You could easily spend a few days or a week just enjoying yourself there without leaving."
4902,73,"thanks you for your kind and detailed review!! Glad the composting toilet didn't gross you out....told you so....love to have you back anytime, you were very easy going guest...stay safe and healthy. lady had an emergency operation and says bye to you via email....she is okay!"
4903,73,"Henry and Judith have built a superb treehouse in a wonderful area!! They're both lovely hosts; making you feel very welcome and relaxed as soon as you arrive. Its perfect for anyone wants to get away from busy campgrounds or resorts, but also a great upgrade for the camper who wants a more solid shelter for a few nights. In fact, the treehouse is more than just a shelter (emphasis on house) and the woods and pond at Henry's and Judith's make for a great setting to take it easy."
4904,73,thanks for the great review...hope you saw everything you wanted to...
4905,73,"The view from the treehouse is stunning! The owner’s have put a lot of time into creating this property and it shows. There are many art installations throughout the property, and areas that evoke playfulness. It’s truly a magical place!"
4906,73,"we hope to see you again sometime, your 'vibes' were great!"
4907,73,"Henry & Judith are the most stunning hosts. They are so welcoming & friendly & so is sweet ladybug. The treehouse was the best retreat into nature for us, definitely take advantage of the trails they have! it’s clear that they have put so much thought & love into this space. Thank you again for the beautiful chanterelles! We absolutely plan to return to peaceful valley!"
4908,73,come on back anytime
4909,73,"Peaceful Valley is an
understatement! Plan to unwind, leave your worries and cares behind. Words cannot explain the beauty of this retreat:)"
4910,73,thanks and do come back if you are on your way to atlanta again....
4911,73,"Henry quickly answered my questions and accommodated my every need. Impressive service and care. Thanks Henry.

The treehouse is filled with artwork - I counted 32 pieces of art in the living room alone, almost all of which were created by the hosts. The outside art is unique and whimsical and I pleasurably examined each piece multiple times. The treehouse is quite comfortable.

I liked swimming in the pond but regret not trying out the zip line. Next time.

The trees, oh the trees! Big and varied.

The hosts tie everything together with their sociability, humor and genuine care for their guests. I will be back and I will recommend this site to my friends.

The directions — follow them exactly!

P.S. Ladybug the dog is a sweetheart."
4912,73,"If only all the guests were like you Chris....thanks for the kind review, you got what we want to do here and that's why we want you back, the sooner the better!!!"
4913,73,"This was one of my favorite Airbnb’s ever. The treehouse is amazing - feels so close to nature but with a kitchen and bathroom. The swimming pond and zip line are right outside. We had coffee and meals on our deck and and then enjoyed hiking and swimming all day. Henry and Judith are wonderful hosts and have really made a unique, beautiful space to get away. We loved it here!!"
4914,73,"we have a lot of guests coming back for more, great you enjoyed it so much, you were lovely company!"
4915,73,Sweet mountain getaway in a fairytale garden!
4916,73,"As always, my stay in the valley was perfect! Thank you, Henry and Judith for being such wonderful hosts!"
4917,73,it's so easy to host friends instead of strangers....
4918,73,This place is amazing and everything we hoped for!! They are very safe and conscious about the current pandemic and everything was clean and easy to figure out. It’s the perfect little oasis. I would love to stay here again and enjoy the zip line and yoga. You feel like you’re at home! Our only regret is wishing we could stay longer. Thanks again for everything!!
4919,73,thanks and stay safe...
4920,73,Adorable little tree house! So many thoughtful little details. The owners are very friendly and the property is super gorgeous. Fair price and very romantic little gataway
4921,73,we are glad you had a great stay
4922,73,This experience wasn’t just breathtaking but also breathgiving!!! I returned home feeling oh so bummed that I had to leave and am no longer there but with each thought there is comfort thinking about how I might get to relax and regroup at this magical place again someday. It’s such a quirky peaceful retreat at this lovely tree house.
4923,73,"glad you had time to regroup, come back anytime...."
4924,73,My fiance and I stayed in Henry and Judiths lovely treehouse for a much needed quiet escape. It was everything we had hoped for and more!
4925,73,thanks and good luck for the future...
4926,73,The cabin and land are both whimsical and peaceful. The hosts are super sweet and it was a perfect getaway. I look forward to going back :-)
4927,73,"great to connect with you Josh, always welcome back!"
4928,73,"We had a WONDERFUL stay. Very peaceful & quiet & away from the noise. We loved the zip line & brought some floats for the swimming hole. We enjoyed all the windows in the treehouse especially upstairs where you have the forest on one side & water on the other. It was lovely. Had everything we needed, the AC kept us plenty cool at night. There’s hiking around the property & lots of cool unique things set up in the woods along different paths. Henry & Judith are super sweet & we felt very welcomed. We can’t wait to visit again!
We saw it was tucked away from town so we brought in a cooler with meals to cook & it worked perfect! Great little getaway for my boyfriend & I."
4929,73,"thanks callie for this very nice review....and if you ever want to come back, lets talk about the doggie hint, hint....judith ps: we understand about the communal soap bar, but you were the first guest of the year, so nobody had used it since october 2019, and i didn't even think about it being an issue. we have a soap dispenser now, thanks for the heads up!!! j."
4930,73,Amazing place and great location surrounded by many attractions. Henry and Judith we’re very welcoming. The house was unique and inviting.
4931,73,"thanks, maybe next time some acro?!?!?"
4932,73,"This space has everything you need for a cozy retreat. It is beyond clean. The bed is more comfortable than our own! The kitchen was fully equipped. There were a variety of games to play, books to read, and movies to watch. The area is beautiful. The hosts are lovely,
gracious, and engaging. We highly recommend!"
4933,73,"We absolutely love the “tree house”! It was my second stay. We enjoyed our greeting from Ladybug, Henry, and Judith, the space is so much fun, and yoga class is fantastic. The grounds are beautiful and we will hopefully have more time to hike and explore next visit! Wonderful hosts and stay."
4934,75,"Very cozy little cabin and stunning view. The amenities provided went well beyond the basics, especially in the kitchen."
4935,75,"Wonderful, quiet, peaceful, relaxing location; just what we were looking for."
4936,75,"This is such a nice and quiet place with great views. If you're looking for a peaceful trip, but have options to drive into town or near by towns, this is it! Jenny is an excellent communicator, and very kind person. Highly recommend!!"
4937,75,Liked the view. Loved having a fire pit.
4938,75,"We had such a wonderful stay at Jenny’s cabin! The views are spectacular and the cabin is cozy and filled with art, books, and games. A great launching point for hikes in the area. Jenny is a fantastic host - super easy to communicate with and available for any questions (including about the area, recommendations, etc). Our dog had a great time, too!"
4939,75,We had a great time! Very quiet with amazing views! We will definitely be back!!
4940,75,We had a great time here! It was the perfect cozy camp with a great view.
4941,75,"Jenny’s place was a PERFECT place for our stay over the holiday. If you’re looking for solitude surrounded by gorgeous views, this is the place! We didn’t see or hear another person the entire time we were there. The cabin is so well-appointed and cozy--and her personal touches add to the charm! There is an incredible selection of books for when you’re ready to wind down, and while it’s the perfect place to unplug (no cell service), there is good internet. It was no problem streaming a movie on our laptop. We enjoyed walking with our pups during the day and spending time by the fire looking at the stars in the evening. We’ll definitely be back to do more exploring! I should mention that Jenny is VERY quick to respond to inquiries--and I’d suggest following her directions, g**gle maps tried to send us on a non-road and then, with no signal, couldn’t reroute. (Also, if you're interested in local/NC foods, I recommend checking out ""Yonder."")"
4942,75,"My 8yr old Son and I stayed here. Place is absolutely beautiful. Very quiet and private. If you're not used to old country roads be sure to arrive before dark. If you are you'll enjoy climbing the driveway/road. Son got a little freaked out first time up it, lol. Didn't have a problem with GPS as others have mentioned. Gem mining less than 10min away. Will book again. Wonderful getaway."
4943,75,Absolute perfect choice for a secluded weekend getaway. It was in close distance to downtown Franklin. We will definitely be back.
4944,75,"What a beautiful view! My husband was obsessed with sitting outside and you can even see the mountains from bed which is amazing. The drive up was a little scary for us city folks but you get used to it. There was also a neighbor dog who chased my car which was a little unsettling.

Having a kitchen with a big fridge and oven/ stove was very useful.
We had a full thanksgiving meal and it was perfect. This cabin has so many games and books which were a lot of fun. It was nice to disconnect from technology/ the real world. There is an unsalted gem mine five minutes down from the cabin which we spent 4 hours at. It was so fun and the people were so nice.

Definitely recommend staying here for a nice private stay. Some stink bugs, lady bugs and a few spiders kept finding their way inside but that’s expected for being in nature. Also close enough for a trip to the Smokey mountains!"
4945,75,Amazing stay in a very peaceful setting unlike any other. It was better than described and we would definitely stay again. Thanks Jenny!
4946,75,"Great view, comfy king sized bed, all the amenities. Quiet and relaxing. Nearby ruby mining operations. Plenty of stores with a 25 minute drive in Franklin."
4947,75,"Jenny is a wonderful host and her cabin is very cozy, private and has amazing views! She’s made sure all essentials are provided and even added a bit extra!! Franklin is a cute little mountain town close to many hiking activities! We enjoyed the privacy and peace and quiet! The mountain road up was not a problem for us (even tho we had 4WD we only used it on the driveway ) Jenny mentioned in her directions that your GPS may take you to a gated community and she is correct!!! We found if you plug in Tippett Creek Rd instead of her address that it gets you right to the mountain road. Was a very enjoyable weekend!!!"
4948,75,"My husband and I wanted a special trip to celebrate our 20th Anniversary. We booked in May for our late October trip because I wanted to see the Fall colors!

One month before our planned trip we were hit by Hurricane Ian. God knew we would need this trip in October (our anniversary is actually in August). It was perfect!!

We were secluded in Jenny’s cabin on the top of the mountain with the most amazing creation to behold. We hiked nearby and came back each day to our “home” for the week and sat and enjoyed that million $ view. We played games, relaxed and reconnected after experiencing the aftermath of such devastation in our community.

Jenny was so great about answering questions and communicating prior to our visit, and even after we checked in when I had a couple of questions.

We brought our pup with us and he loved it too! He especially loved that he was “eye-level” with all those squirrels when he was on the porch.

We are planning a return trip!"
4949,75,"This was my second stay and it was just as wonderful as I had anticipated! Jenny’s cabin has everything you need to slow down, reset & recharge. Jenny is also very responsive and her expectations for how to leave the cabin are very reasonable. I may become a regular!"
4950,75,"I will start by saying WOW!
Me and my family are traveling a lot , but this place is the best that we stayed in! The whole fall/country/relaxation experience..
Jenny is the kindest host,
So helpful and caring
I can’t thank you enough!
See you next time 🥰we can’t wait!"
4951,75,"We had a lovely stay at this cabin in the mountains for my 30th! Definitely recommend it as a great spot for a cozy quiet stay.
There were so many amenities, that we felt right at home cooking and enjoying the view."
4952,75,Jenny's place was very accommodating with supplies stocked up. It was a beautiful view and great way to escape the business of life.
4953,75,This was our second stay here and we want to keep coming back and making a tradition of it. We always feel so refreshed after saying here. The view is amazing & the Mother Nature is healing. ❤️ Look no further if you want some time away from the noise and tune into the peace this place offers. Thanks Jenny. 😊
4954,75,"This place is magical. Not many places still exist like this place. The inside is home-y, inviting, and comfortable. The outside is, as previously mentioned, magical. The view stretches (probably) hundreds of miles and the sunsets are as beautiful as a sunset can be. You could easily spend the entire time here just sitting on the porch, but Jenny also provides arts and crafts, puzzles, books, and plenty of other things to entertain you for a quiet get-away to one of the most wonderful places we have personally experienced."
4955,75,"Jenny’s place had everything we needed to enjoy the peace and quiet. Games, books, and a great view! We loved how dog friendly it was (bowls for food and water, enclosed porch, etc) and our dog loved the porch. We loved the fantastic view from it. All the thoughtful touches in the cabin made us feel instantly at home."
4956,75,Beautiful views!! I didn’t want to leave once I got there!!
4957,75,Jenny is an excellent host and her home never disappoints!! I could go on and on about her home. It’s just perfect!🤍
4958,75,"Jenny's cabin is everything stated and more. A perfect place to unplug, unwind and relax. A superb base for exploring all the area has to offer. The selection of books and games fit right in with the eclectic style of the host. I felt right at home. The only down is the mountain dirt road we were not willing to drive at night. Would definitely stay again next time in the area."
4959,75,"Cabin is wonderful. We were there for a long rainy weekend and it had everything we needed to keep us entertained. Very dog friendly, clean, cozy and Jenny was easy to communicate with. We hope to be back again soon."
4960,75,Peaceful. Place was very clean and very well equipped. Host responded to all communications within a few minutes. Would definitely stay again.
4961,75,"I love the cabin, definitely a nice place to stay for a couple days and unwind from society. My fiancé and I loved the views and the little town of Franklin."
4962,75,Amazing views and very homey! Highly recommend for a relaxing retreat.
4963,75,Jenny's cabin is amazing. It is truly a creative gem. Make sure you read her directions that she gives you to get there. The cabin was just as described. You will be greeted by little dogs and they (dogs) check in from time to time. The stocked cabinet was a plus. The view was absolutely breathtaking! We enjoyed the adventure getting to the house.🤣 We hope to come back soon.
4964,75,The only thing I regret is not staying longer! Needed the solitude and being unplugged.
4965,75,"I can't say anything that hasn't already been said so belive what everyone else has said about the cabin. Views, views & more views... We LOVED it!"
4966,75,Such a great spot to get away! The views and sunset were unreal. Jenny was extremely responsive and a helpful! The cabin had everything you need to get away and relax! Would definitely visit again.
4967,75,Awesome view and an unbeatable value. Perfect cabin for a family getaway.
4968,75,"Jenny’s cabin was perfect for my solo trip to Franklin with the pups. This was my first solo trip so of course I was concerned about safety. I can tell you that once I arrived at the cabin, I felt completely at ease. It’s the second to last house up a series of roads. No one could find me if they wanted to! :) Dogs loved to roam around off leash but were too tired from hiking to go far. This trip we hiked Tennett, Whiterock, and Scaly mountains. Jenny’s cabin was a great base camp with all the essentials. The view from her porch is AMAZING and best at sunset!! Don’t forget to stop at the Lazy Hiker in Franklin for a burger and cold beer after your hike. This was my favorite Franklin Airbnb and I will be back!"
4969,75,"Loved our stay , will definitely be back ."
4970,75,"Two nights was not enough! The view is unreal and the house is super cozy. You’re very secluded but not roughing it. Jenny has everything you could ever need in the cabin. We loved being able to take our pups. The town of Franklin is amazing; Small shops with downtown activities. Plenty of spots to hike, fish, or drive up for a view. We are already planning our next trip back!"
4971,75,"I highly recommend Jenny’s mountain cabin. A serene , and relaxing getaway from everyday life."
4972,75,This cabin is worth the journey. The one lane mountain road is quite an added adventure but once there this was the rest and relaxation we needed. The unplug was amazing. The welcome gift in the fridge was perfect. (We love local craft beers.) The views of the mountains changed perspectives with the day and was mesmerizing. Our pups loved the hill sprints on the road from the lower neighbors driveway to Jenny's cabin driveway. We did this multiple times each day. Did I mention the view from the porch was divine??? Thanks for sharing your space.
4973,75,"Hey there, Courtney! I just saw your private note. I love that you had a good time AND that you were inspired to work on your quilt projects when you get home. The cabin seems to bring out a lot of creativity in our wonderful guests - many who would enjoy spending more time crafting, painting and making music. We do hope you'll take that home with you and remember the view while you're quilting!"
4974,75,"if you're looking for a quaint cabin in the mountains with gorgeous views this is the place to go! My husband and I loved relaxing on the porch after morning hikes, would definitely stay again"
4975,75,Couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay! Jenny was always quick to answer any questions I had. Definitely coming back.
4976,75,"Where do I begin?! Coolest little cabin I’ve ever stayed at, and I’ve been around! Takes you back to a simpler time. When you’re here, all your worries are gone. The views from the deck are literally spirit-stirring! If you want to unplug and reboot your body and soul, come here, make a cup of coffee or grab a cold beer and enjoy the views form the rocking chair or hammock. Thank you so much for sharing this piece of nirvana with myself, my wife and I.

PS: if you ever want to sell, let me know!"
4977,75,"This place is healing, close to some amazing hikes, and absolutely perfect. I will be back!"
4978,75,"Can I say WOW!! The view was AMAZING!! Absolutely love the feel of the house!! Definitely simple living!! A place to rest and relax and get back to the simple life!! The stars are amazing up there! Jenny is a wonderful host. She is very responsive and communicates quickly and well. She left us a gift, the house was stoked with everything you would need for your stay, besides your own personal stuff.
Honestly it made me want to live there! I would move there in a heart beat!! Jenny definitely has a hidden gem in the mountains! I hope to come back soon!!"
4979,75,"Jenny’s place is spectacular!! The view is amazing, the hammock is great! The bed is comfortable! The wifi is great! Everything was just wonderful!! The driveway is definitely steep, so listen to Jenny about vehicle. Everything was so wonderful, we would stay here again!"
4980,75,"Fabulous place, fully stocked with everything you need! View is beautiful. Huge bed. Rocking chair and rocker swing on the porch! *You definitely need a 4x4 and if possible, an automatic and not super long (there's a couple hairpin turns). We have a manual, crew cab, long bed F350 and there were a few times we just had to ""go for it"" and pray for the best! ha ha ha"
4981,75,"My husband and I stayed for a weekend. The view is amazing, and Jenny has thought of everything to make sure you feel right at home. Her place is pet friendly and our dog enjoyed her stay as well. If you are looking for a private getaway, this is it!"
4982,75,Worth it! The cabin is great and will be even better once the wood burning stove is in. Spectacular view and away from it all. The Wi-Fi works if you want to use it but I advise not connecting to get the full experience.
4983,75,wonderful no fuss cabin! the view was wonderful and we enjoyed a unplugged getaway
4984,75,Amazing views! If you want to relax look no further!
4985,75,"This house is wonderful! It's exactly as described and more. Absolutely worth the trip, but definitely listen to the awd/4wd advice. The view is unbelievable, and the house itself is so comfortable, you can tell there was a ton of thought put into it! A great way to disconnect."
4986,75,"When Jenny says 4 wheel drive….it was for good reason! My Jeep got to stretch her legs lol. The place was perfect! Being a nature lover, I didn’t want to leave! House was clean and comfortable and quiet! Jenny is an amazing host And definitely recommend!"
4987,75,"Jenny’s little cabin was the perfect place for my husband and I to relax for a few days. We needed a little vacation and this home, and the surrounding area, was more than we could have asked for. We found the scenery Hummingbird Hill to be beyond picturesque. We were fortunate enough to drive up a long driveway of blooming Flame Azalea and Mountain Laurel that took our breath away. The view from the porch is breathtaking throughout the day and the sunsets perfectly over the horizon in front of you. The Franklin area offers plenty of outdoor recreation and a wide array of food. We found the Yonder Community Market for a wide array of delicious snacks. The coffee at the Crabtree General Store is a must!"
4988,75,"If you love the mountains, this is the place for you! The views are immaculate and the space inside of the home is extremely comfortable and well decorated. This was my second time visiting Jenny’s property with my girlfriend and the view from the deck just never gets old! The privacy is very nice as well, since the house is in the woods you really get to immerse yourself in nature. It’s the perfect place for couples to get away, or even small families. There are so many towns to checkout within an hour drive such as Cherokee, Highlands, Cashiers, Maggie Valley, Bryson City, Sylva, Clayton, etc. The Appalachian trail is nearby as well (definitely check out wayah bald). Thanks so much for having us again Jenny!"
4989,75,"amazing little escape. bring the 4x4, it's an off-road adventure to get to the top of the mountain!"
4990,75,So great!! Absolutely off the grid if you want to be but also some signal and wifi for if you need to tap back in. Zero complaints.
4991,75,We had a lovely time with a great view. I highly recommend it!
4992,75,"Jenny’s cabin is an amazing getaway. It was quiet, peaceful, and the views can’t be beat. If you do decide to get out of the hammock, there are great dog-friendly places in Sylva and Bryson City to eat, drink, and have a little fun. We will absolutely be back!"
4993,75,A beautiful location and the place was perfect for resting after exploring the park!
4994,75,Such a great place! The view was worth our drive and every penny! The cabin was comfortable and cozy! A wonderful stay! We will definitely be back!
4995,75,"Jenny's cabin is, hands down, the best Airbnb experience I've ever had. It's in a wondefully remote location with a spectacular view, and very good energy. And the drive into town is easy. Just make sure you drive a vehicle that's capable of navigating a steepish dirt road. Highly recommended for a romatic getaway or any other kind of outing with friends or loved ones."
4996,75,This was our 2nd trip back here and of course we loved every second of it. Jenny is absolutely wonderful and very accommodating! We spent most of the time outside on the patio and relaxing in the hammock. This is the perfect location to get unplugged and tune the world out. We’ve already booked for here in Sept.! Can’t wait to be back!♥️
4997,75,"We really loved our stay at Jenny's cabin and our visit to Franklin. We were there 4 days, and the cabin had everything we needed. When we arrived, the fridge had some basic necessities stocked including a couple of cans of beer from the local brewery:) We spent a lot of time out on the porch watching the beautiful sunsets, and it was a perfect place to hang out with our dogs and end the day. The king sized bed was super comfortable with the perfect amount of blankets for the still chilly weather. The whole cabin was clean and cozy, and we feltbright at home immediately. If we are ever in the area again, we would not hesitate to stay again."
4998,75,This cabin is perfect to get away. The WiFi is surprisingly good but all the board games a puzzles make is so easy to escape. The views are breathe taking and we spent most of our time outside. The road can be a little daunting at first but once you get up and down once it’s really not bad. Don’t let it stop you from checking out this wonderful little cabin.
4999,75,"Thank you for your kind review, Michael! We're glad you enjoyed your stay!! And yes - the road is a doozy, which is why I check everyone's vehicle before accepting. We hope that's just another fun part of the adventure. Thank you!!"
5000,75,Cool spot!
5001,75,This place was amazing. 10/10 would stay here again. Breathtaking views from the patio. Very cozy inside and out!
5002,75,"Amazing quiet and cute cabin tucked away with a million dollar view from the front porch. Loved our weekend hideaway. Played board games, had fun hiking nearby and enjoyed the peace and quiet. Amazing value!"
5003,75,"Thank you for your kind review, Nic. We appreciate you and the great care you showed our cabin."
5004,75,"Jenny’s cabin is nothing short of delightful. We arrived at night and were instantly charmed by this cozy, sweet space. The description of the road & driveway leading to the cabin is accurate—our Subaru Outback handled it well, but a vehicle without AWD or 4WD would probably not make it. When we woke up the next morning, we were blown away by the view. It was breathtaking. Being in the mountains fed our souls. Being able to return to this simple, sweet cabin was restorative in the best way.

Downtown Franklin is a great! The Lazy Hiker Brewery is an excellent spot for a beer at the end of the day. The historical society has a building at the end of Main Street that is truly living history. The gentleman volunteering the day we visited had fascinating history to share; I could have spent the entire day listening to them. There are tons of little shops to visit.

We also pulled off the road leading to Dry Falls (which is a super cool spot) and hiked down to the base of a waterfall. It was tricky, but so worth it.

Thank you to Jenny for sharing her little piece of heaven with the rest of us."
5005,75,Awesome place to unwind
5006,75,"Jenny is an amazing host! From the beginning of our stay, we felt right at home. If you are looking for a once in a life time stay, this is the place for you. The views are tremendous and the cabin is as cozy as can be. If you love a quiet get away, stay here and don’t second guess your decision to book. You will not be disappointed!"
5007,76,"Quit thinking about it, book it, you won’t regret it ‼️"
5008,76,"I had initial hesitations about lodging on a boat, especially with a history of motion sickness and high wind advisories almost half of our stay. However, we had an INCREDIBLE time. This was such a cool experience and the hosts literally couldn’t have done more to be accommodating. The sleeping spaces are better than most standard lodging and what affordable hotel room allows you the ability to have truly uninterrupted scenic views?! The marina facilities were much closer and more accessible than I had anticipated and we were even able to watch March Madness from the boat’s main living space. We were walking distance from the beach and just a short drive from local dining and award-winning treats at Britt’s Donuts. Our friends and pups loved it as much as we did - I honestly can’t wait to do it again, I hope they keep this place available and no idiot ruins it for everyone else!"
5009,76,Thanks for the response! I am so glad you enjoyed your stay and you will be welcome back anytime!
5010,76,Great stay!
5011,76,Thanks Lisa! Glad you had a great time!
5012,76,"First time my wife was on a larger boat and absolutely loved it. Wine on the Aft Deck watching a spectacular sunset was a pleasant surprise. Master bed was so comfortable it fell like we were sleeping in the clouds. The Helm room was cozy with a big screen TV and I felt what it would feel like to be a Captain standing at the Ship’s Wheel. The galley was as expected and had everything you need to cook, but who wants to cook on vacation! We loved our stay and we will book again!"
5013,76,"Very unique, great get away. The bed was super comfy. Pleased with our experience!"
5014,76,Pretty cool experience.
5015,76,"Awesome, unique experience! Would love to visit again. The hosts were fantastic with their communication, and made the stay very easy to navigate."
5016,76,Austin! It was a pleasure to have you and please stay with us again!
5017,76,We picked this spot out to have a fun experience for our little girls birthday and she was absolutely in love! It is an older boat with lots of character and naturally has its quirks but anything we needed help with the owner was available and promptly responded. Fun was had by both adults and kids! A much needed relaxing stay away from our normal hustle. We would definitely love to visit again!
5018,76,Hey Christy! Thank you very much! I feel so bad that the outlet decided to quit on your stay! That is being fixed as I type this! I hope you are able to come back and stay with us! Get in touch a few months out and I will make sure to set aside time to take you guys out for a cruise! Thank you again for choosing to stay with us!
5019,76,"This was my first experience with Airbnb and I wouldn't trade it for any other place!
It was so peaceful and relaxing even in the rain and cold! It was a beautiful view and warm and cozy inside! The hosts were so kind and worked with us on every angle of the trip! It was really clean inside and out as well as the dock and surrounding areas! Shower and certain bathroom uses were such a short walk away!
The hosts also made sure most daily necessities for kitchen and bathroom were stocked up :)
Would definitely love to return to this location! 10 out of 10!"
5020,77,"The stay was wonderful, peaceful. My brother and his Bride said they felt right at home"
5021,77,"This was a beautiful spot to relax for a couple of days! It was also drivable to many atteactions. My husband and I had a great time, and we would definitely return!"
5022,77,"Charming place with plenty of space. Beautiful craftsmanship and finishing touches. The view from the deck is gorgeous and so peaceful! Short drive to the Outer Banks. Becky is a great host. If in the area, would definitely stay here again."
5023,77,Great place to stay
5024,77,"Rebecca's space was warm and welcoming. It was very clean and had all the conveniences of home. Even the littlest details were not overlooked. We went off-season, so there were not many places to eat, but Rebecca left a wonderful list of local places and the supermarket was a short drive away. We enjoyed watching the wildlife and you simply could not beat the incredible view. Make sure to get up in time to watch the sunrise. We would highly recommend."
5025,77,It was a wonderful stay the location is absolutely beautiful! We will be back.
5026,77,"Church's Island Carriage House is a perfect getaway! The location is quiet and peaceful, but you aren't too far from restaurants and shops. The morning sunrise is a sight to behold and there's an osprey nest out on the waterfront in front of the carriage house where we were able to observe a pair. Their dog, Daisy Mae is a sweet hound who is very welcoming as well. Southern hospitality at it's finest. Our hosts were quite friendly and had vast knowledge of the area. If you are seeking a serene and tranquil getaway, look no further! Thank you Becky for a wonderful stay!!"
5027,77,"Rebecca's home was wonderful, with an amazing view and beautifully decorated living space. It was the perfect place for a quiet weekend for two!"
5028,77,Beautiful water view from all living room windows. Immaculate. Go to topside as she recommends for some of the best fried chicken you will ever eat. Very peaceful and restorative setting
5029,77,"This was a perfect gift and was exactly what was needed. Very beautiful, RIGHT ON THE WATER. Beautiful sunrise. So peaceful. Would like to do this every year at the same time."
5030,77,"This was the second time we have stayed at Becky’s and it was every bit as nice as last year. The living space was spotless and the views great as always. Had a couple of ospreys adding to the viewing enjoyment. The beauty of this time of year is, no crowds. The Kill Devil Grille was delicious as was the Blue Moon restaurant. Becky’s is well worth the fee. Don’t hesitate to stay there."
5031,77,"A beautiful, quiet, private retreat with a gorgeous view of the water. Well equipped rental with comfortable bed."
5032,77,"We had a wonderful stay! Peaceful setting, beautiful view, comfortable accommodations, and lovely decor.

We had a lovely time walking the six miles round trip (mostly across the causeway) to get to the Coinjock Marina Restaurant. I recommend if you’re into that sort of thing!"
5033,77,"Thank you Rebecca for such an amazing time. Everything was perfect ! Such a great location. So well equipped. Prompt responses to any questions.
The sunrises were stunning and worth getting up early for. Would love to return."
5034,77,great!!!!!
5035,77,Very good
5036,77,A beautiful spot! Don't hesitate to book! The views are incredible and Becky's place is one of the cleanest AirBnB's I have ever stayed in! Becky was very communicative and all instructions were clear. The cottage is exactly as pictured with every amenitiy you could need.
5037,77,Rebecca is super nice and the house is pristine with a beautiful view
5038,77,This was our second stay— every bit as lovely as the first time.
5039,77,Great stay and def a place you can get away from the normal day to day business of life. Love the scenery and location! This place is a gem for location and views. Would highly recommend
5040,77,"The Carriage House is a great place for a couple's retreat. A very tastefully decorated
space in a beautiful location!"
5041,77,"A sunny, charming little place off the beaten path. Beautiful water views and a friendly host!"
5042,77,"Wonderful place, beautiful view and peaceful. This place has everything you need."
5043,77,"Clean, easy to access."
5044,77,"Wonderful, peaceful place. Well furnished and beautifully decorated. Extremely clean!! Super comfy bed. We would stay again and recommend to other people. Thanks for letting us stay."
5045,77,"Beautifully decorated, gorgeous setting, perfect for one or a couple! We will definitely be back!"
5046,77,Thank you very much for providing such a wonderful house for stay. We really enjoyed our time here and definitely planning to visit again.
5047,77,The cottage was as described. There are plenty of closets to store luggage out of the way. We happened to be there during a heavy rain and the sound of it hitting the roof was so relaxing. The check in and check out procedures were easy to follow.
5048,77,"We had an amazing view of the sound, the space was very well furnished, and Rebecca was an awesome host! Would 10/10 recommend."
5049,77,"Absolutely wonderful stay! Beautiful guest cottage built to the side of the main house, but still private. The quality of the cabin and little details like coffee kept in the fridge for freshness, and a fence to keep your stay private prove she truly cares about her guests. I would love to stay again if the chance arises!"
5050,77,"We absolutely loved Becky’s guest cottage! It is a beautiful place, thoughtfully decorated and tons of details to include everything you need. We HIGHLY recommend it and will be back soon!"
5051,77,This place is so lovely. Cozy. Comfortable. Outstanding views (sunrise from deck & moon from bedroom). Extremely comfortable bed and pillows. Tastefully decorated. Peaceful. Clean. Provided all that we needed. Easy check-in and out. A solid place (very windy during our stay but no breezes inside)--exquisite craftsmanship. Highly recommend. We even got to see 2 otters briefly playing in the sound.
5052,77,"Beautiful decor and great closet space, cozy bed, great shower with hot water and good appliances—a delight to stay here and look out on the water. As a light sleeper, I struggled with noises from the road and some kind of water heater or something—but bringing a fan helped.

Rebecca was super easy to communicate with and let us use their dock for water access.

Best part is the balcony and views! Lovely place and would come again."
5053,77,"Rebecca's place is absolutely perfect!
Her attention to detail made our stay very enjoyable. And truly appreciated how clean it was."
5054,77,"The perfect place to visit if you need a get-away. Perfectly apportioned with brilliant views, you’ll not only love your stay here but you’ll want to come back!"
5055,77,"Rebecca's place is charming and wonderful. The porch overlooking the bay was a wonderful place to sit out in. The bed and linens were very comfortable. Everything available such as kitchen utensils, linens, pillows, outside deck cushions - were in great condition and very clean. I would absolutely stay again!"
5056,77,"My pregnant wife & I came through for our ""Babymoon"" & found the accommodations to be very peaceful, quiet, & most importantly comfortable (which was especially important as my wife has not been able to sleep well through her pregnancy, & actually slept great every night while we were here). Hopefully we can come back soon once our little one is here & able to travel!"
5057,77,The place was wonderful and Rebecca was a great host and either had all of our questions answered ahead of time or got back to us promptly. Would recommend in a heartbeat!!
5058,77,This is a great place for a quite retreat. The view is amazing. You will want to return for another visit.
5059,77,Lovely place to stay right on the Currituck Sound. The accommodations were very comfortable . We will definitely stay here again!!❤️
5060,77,"The Carriage House is the sweetest place to stay! The views from the deck are incredible. It’s such a relaxing place to unwind. It was extremely clean and comfortable, and Rebecca and Alex were the nicest! Looking forward to another visit in the future!"
5061,77,"Cozy, clean, private, quiet & peaceful. The view is spectacular for sunrises. Loved the seclusion and quietness away from the crowds."
5062,77,"The Carriage House was an absolutely delightful stay for .y hisband and myself. It is located on the water and we were able to catch ""first light"" with coffee from the balcony. Is is located in a private area and Becky granted us our privacy! If given the opportunity, we will stay here again, happily!! 5 STARS, all the way!!"
5063,77,"Excellent stay, one of my favorites I would go back too. Convenient locations, extra clean, owners made great recommendations, couldn’t ask for anything more. Thank you Becky!"
5064,77,"The Carriage House is an absolute GEM! We loved it! We had absolutely everything that we needed (except a telescope. Lol!) We got to see the stars, (still and shooting,) and Saturn and Jupiter in a moonless sky! Thank you so much!"
5065,77,"If you are looking for a peaceful and quiet get away this is the place. Rebecca's place is clean, nicely decorated and comfortable. Coinjock Marina is a great place for food that is just down the road a few miles. We will be back for sure!"
5066,77,Had the pleasure of having the perfect peaceful getaway here. Would recommend to anyone looking for a quiet place to relax! We’ll definitely be coming back.
5067,77,"What a great place to stay! So relaxing, clean and comfortable!"
5068,77,Great location !! Well stocked kitchen
5069,77,"Everything was perfect. The location is amazing. The space and decor are perfect. It’s obvious Rebecca has a passion for her home, and it shows throughout! This was a fantastic visit! I look forward to staying here again."
5070,77,"Our stay at the carriage house was a dream! The location was perfect for us--out of the way of the bustle of the beachgoers, but still an easy drive to Kitty Hawk and Elizabeth City. The cottage itself was lovely, with all the bedroom/bathroom/kitchen amenities necessary, as well as maps and recommendations of local restaurants. We enjoyed going to the beach a few of the weekdays as well as the sanctuary vineyard winery just down the road. Would also recommend the restaurant at the waterlily marina!"
5071,77,"My wife and I had a delightful and relaxing stay at the carriage house. It was exactly the quiet and beautiful place we were looking for. I was able to work remotely for few days as the place had everything that I needed.

We made a point of getting up early each day to enjoy the remarkable sunrises I’ve the currituck sound from our deck. We also made sure to get some naps in as well.

I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a peaceful getaway in this area."
5072,77,The stay was great for the Two of us. It was quiet and peaceful with little to no cars passing by as we enjoyed taking pictures of the Sound and Seagulls.
5073,77,Becky's place is wonderful! The location is peaceful and relaxing; there is a grocery store close by and options for dining out. The place is very clean and comfortable and thoughtfully decorated. Becky is an excellent communicator. She had plenty of suggestions for places to eat/things to do and made sure we had everything we needed. We were sad to see our time come to an end and hope to come back again some time.
5074,77,"Loved the view, the vibe, and the overall experience. It is a little over than hour to get to the Corolla beaches but my SO and I preferred spending more time at this cottage than the more touristy spots. Very cute, clean, and well-stocked for the necessities. Highly recommend! Already thinking about when I’ll be coming back to this Airbnb :)"
5075,77,Loved our stay here!!
5076,77,"We had the BEST time during our stay at the Church's Island Carriage House. Becky has really thought of everything with this peaceful getaway -- nicely decorated and furnished (the bed and pillows were very comfortable!), soft luxury bath towels, super clean, and everything you could need in the kitchen! One of our favorite parts was the balcony, where you get beautiful views of the sunrise over the sound right outside your door! There are Adirondack chairs with cushions, and a sail shade that is easy to put up if the sun is too hot/bright during the day. We spent multiple mornings and afternoons out there taking in the peaceful sounds and views of the water and birds. Also a great place to read a book or play a game! We stayed here over the 4th of July and were lucky enough to see multiple fireworks shows out across the sound from different locations (the closest was the Corolla fireworks), all from the comfort of our balcony! Becky was a great communicator and we really had everything we needed! We liked that we were away from all of the hustle and bustle of the Outer Banks, but still close enough that we could make a trip to the beach during our stay (closest beach is about 30min away, we went to a beach a little further out based on a recommendation from Becky :) ). There are also multiple farmers markets nearby that are definitely worth a visit! We loved every minute of our stay and will definitely be back!"
5077,77,"Utterly, the best value for a relaxing getaway."
5078,77,"This was our second time staying. Rebecca’s cottage is perfect for two. There is everything you need, very clean and amazing views!!! Rebecca was very accommodating to our requests due to our work schedules. Highly recommend!!!"
5079,77,"Perfect in every way! Clean, comfortable, and quite. Hope to stay again."
5080,77,"Fantastic host, space, and location! Becky was very responsive and made me feel so welcome. The unit is beautiful, right on the water and an easy drive to OBX. It's very quiet, the bed is extremely comfortable, and the kitchen is fully equipped if you want to make your own meals. One of my favorite stays anywhere!"
5081,77,"Becky’s place is absolutely amazing in every way! Beautiful views! Peaceful and relaxing. We soooo enjoyed starting and ending our days right by the water :) The perfect place for a getaway…and everything was spotless. By far, the nicest Airbnb we’ve ever stayed at. Looking forward to our next visit!"
5082,77,"Peaceful spot off the beaten path a bit, in a lovely neighborhood. So quiet. Balcony is perfect for morning coffee and watching the sunrise. The apartment itself has everything you need and is very clean. Location is about 40ish minutes from Kitty Hawk, Kill Devil Hills, Nags Head, etc."
5083,77,The cottage is wonderful. Everything you need is there. It's a great place to relax and get away from the tourist crowd. The deck with a view complete with an osprey was wonderful. Not too many restaurants nearby but we enjoyed the marina dinners only 3 miles away.
5084,77,I am so happy that I choose here!! Don’t miss this cozy place. Becky respond the message very quick! She is really nice.
5085,77,I would highly recommend Rebecca’s place on Church Island!! The view was beyond words!! I can’t wait to go back!!
5086,77,"Perfect rental for 2 people, right on the water. This is an upstairs space so keep in mind, if you can't do stairs. Short drive to the OB . Several places to eat near by. The Marina and BBQ and Seafood places all were very good! Very clean and well maintained property. Wonderful hosts!"
5087,77,We had a wonderful getaway. The cottage was the cleanest rental we've ever been to. The furnishings and decor were lovely. We enjoyed amazing views over the Currituck Sound from the deck. The neighborhood was very pretty and peaceful. It was only 45 minutes to a couple of hours to places we wanted to visit. Rebecca was very nice and always quick to respond to any inquiries.
5088,77,Perfect getaway for two! Rebecca’s cottage was very clean and adorably decorated! The views of both the sunrise and moon rise were amazing! We had everything we needed. Will definitely book there again. Short drive to OBX.
5089,77,There is a wonderful view of the sound from the carriage house. We could watch a pair of nesting osprey while we enjoyed our breakfast.
5090,77,Perfect spot a getaway weekend. Very clean and excellent amenities.
5091,77,"My husband, who is a perfectionist, absolutely LOVED this Airbnb and kept telling me how much he loved it ! He was so impressed with the thoughtful details of the home. We found everything to be new and very clean. The towels, pillows and sheets were all luxurious. There were many extras that just made us feel well taken care of. We brought our own food and found the kitchen to have everything we needed to cook. The view of the sound is beautiful. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!"
5092,77,A wonderful place for a couple's getaway. The deck overlooking Currituck Sound is so peaceful and the cottage is very comfortable and private.
5093,77,We had a great stay at the Carriage House! Looking forward to going again! Definitely a five star place!
5094,77,"What a lovely, cozy, gorgeous spot! We loved staying here, with the sunrises streaming into the living room and the ospreys taking turns fishing and protecting their eggs, just off the coastline! The couch and armchairs and bed are sooooo comfy! The space is clean, well appointed, surprisingly roomy for a small place. For our sensitive ears, there was regular traffic on the road that the house is on, but not fast traffic. The house is really well insulated, so we couldn’t hear it inside, with the windows closed. The deck gives access to amazing views of the Sound and the sky and the birds (so many! Crossing morning and evening!), and also the road. Even the deck chairs are cozy. I bundled up even on chilly mornings, as it was such a special perch. Becky was warm and responsive to any needs. Their dogs were love bugs, but you also didn’t have to interact, if it wasn’t your thing. Definitely expect to drive 30-40 minutes (off season) to get to the ocean (OBX), but it’s an easy drive. We explored the Nags Head Woods Preserve (wonderful, lots of different options for length and difficulty), the bird watching at Pea Island. If you’re down that far, you might check out Fish Heads Bar & Grill in Nags Head for some delicious food, on a dock right over the beach. Excellent atmosphere! We’d definitely recommend this find!"
5095,77,"Amazing, private spot with beautiful views !"
5096,77,This was our fourth stay at this wonderful place! Such a peaceful and relaxing place to stay. The apartment has everything we need and Rebecca is so kind and accomodating. We shall return!
5097,77,"Best place we’ve ever stayed. Clean, comfortable, AMAZING views. Couldn’t recommend it more."
5098,77,Great place to stay! We would highly recommend it!
5099,77,Beautiful and very clean. We will definitely be returning!!
5100,77,Loved it!
5101,77,"This was one of the most relaxing stays we have ever had! We loved sitting around and staring out at the water, and spent almost too much time watching the birds nest. It’s such a cute little home that we will miss dearly!"
5102,77,"Rebecca’s place was perfect for us! Comfortable, clean and well appointed. She provides everything you could want. Bedding was wonderful and the mattress was comfortable. The weather was beautiful the first few days so we took full advantage of the deck. We certainly plan to return!"
5103,77,Rebecca's was all it was advertised as and then some. The location on the Sound was gorgeous and quiet. The sun beats in on the East facing deck in the morning and was wonderful to sit and relax on. The apartment itself was very clean and had everything one needed for a multiple day stay. The full kitchen was well outfitted. A relatively short drive to the Outer Banks. It was a very private setting and I would highly recommend it.
5104,77,Extremely clean home and gorgeous view! Great place for a peaceful getaway!
5105,77,"Such a wonderful place for an extended weekend. We loved the remoteness, peacefulness, and view of this location. The morning sunrise over the sound was breathtaking. Only 30-45 min to the beaches in Kitty Hawk and 45-60 minutes to Hampton Roads. Not many options for local restaurants but there is a full refrigerator, stove, and everything you need to cook meals. We are already planning our next trip."
5106,77,"This home was everything everyone said about it. Lovely decorations, extremely clean and comfortable. A full refrigerator for longer stays. Comphy bed and gorgeous views of the sound. We will have to come again in warmer weather. Had a nice quiet few days celebrating our 45th Anniversary!! Thanks again for a great visit!"
5107,77,"Great place for a quiet getaway! I was there when it was cold, windy, and snowy - but enjoyed the view just as much from inside as when I was out on the balcony!"
5108,77,"If you are looking for a quiet place to relax on the water, this is the place. Beautiful view from the balcony of the sound. Not far from major beaches (Kitty Hawk, Duck, Corolla) and great food at the beach. And Becky is an amazing host! Would definitely recommend staying here if you are looking for a getaway!"
5109,77,"The location is perfect and the host were accommodating.
A nice home away from home experience."
5110,77,"Peaceful, wonderful place overlooking the Sound! This host pays attention to detail and provides the perfect get-away!"
5111,77,"After several stays here, I can truly say this place is amazing. And the hosts are always responsive and welcoming. Peaceful, relaxing and beautiful all around."
5112,77,This is one of the very best Airbnb’s we have ever had the pleasure of staying in. The cottage is beautiful & has everything you possibly will need. The view is heavenly. It is so peaceful & quiet here. We plan on coming back again
5113,77,"We had a wonderful stay at Rebecca’s Carriage house. It was clean, nicely furnished and you can’t beat stepping out on to the deck and enjoying the sound. We would rent again in an instance!"
5114,77,"One of the best Airbnbs I've ever stayed at. Place was extremely clean and comfy. Hosts were very nice, accommodating, and communicated well with instructions. Very easy going :) Was visiting my family for the holidays and they stopped by for a few minutes just to catch the view. Both the view and the home are absolutely breathtaking. If you're looking to get away from the city for a weekend or land some peace and quiet by the water, this place is for you!

Also worked remotely there for a week and the internet was great! Amazing place to work from and lots of coffee provided :) Thanks again Becky!"
5115,77,This place is perfect in every way. It’s beautifully appointed down to every possible detail. This was our second stay and it was so comfortable and beautiful. We will definitely be back.
5116,77,The Carriage House offers an exceptionally charming place to stay with beautiful sunrises over the sea!
5117,77,This is one of the best Airbnb’s I have ever stayed in. Highly recommend! Very quiet and high quality place. Beaches are only a half hour drive away in kitty hawk. I hope we will be back!
5118,78,Jane's place was a joy to stay at. Super affordable. Cozy and private Jane was a n excellent host. Especially enjoyed the dry erase wall!
5119,78,"Jane was a wonderful host. If I am ever in the area again, I will definitely stay here again."
5120,78,"Jane has set up a small studio that is perfect for 1-2 people. It is cozy, warm, and has a great vibe. I wish I was able to stay longer!"
5121,78,Enjoyed a second stay at Jane’s place. Appreciated her thoughtful touches and attention to detail. Close to great amenities and Bird Island!
5122,78,Jane is an extremely thoughtful host and her place was a heavenly refuge!
5123,78,this is an absolutely wonderful place to stay I have never felt so at home and cozy anywhere I've stayed before Jane is a wonderful host and responds quickly and is extremely helpful with everything I will 100% be back I've never had such an absolutely perfect and blissful experience Jane is wonderful and I can't wait till I get a chance to come back ☺️
5124,78,"This was such a cute, cozy, and relaxing little studio apartment. It looked just like the photos, was very clean, and had all the little odds and ends (like tape and scissors!) I needed for my stay. It was also very quiet and peaceful at night. Location is in a charming, quiet, and safe neighborhood very close to the beach. Jane was a great host and was very responsive and friendly. Thanks Jane!"
5125,78,Jane's place is quiet and cozy simple easy and pretty much what you expect from the descriptions would definitely stay there again
5126,78,Such a great studio that conveniently located close to the beach. I enjoyed my stay and would highly recommend this gem. Jane has taken the time to add her personal touches to this studio and it has everything you could possibly need.
5127,78,"Quiet, neat, I enjoyed the place."
5128,78,"Let me start by letting y’all know how kind and a great communicator Jane is. My stay at this Airbnb was one of the best I have had. The location was close to a Food Lion, several beaches, and in a safe and quiet neighborhood!
I thought the Airbnb was cut and cozy based on the pictures, but honestly the pictures do no justice. In person, Jane’s place was well beyond my expectations. Also, I can during a rainy weekend, and Jane was kind enough to bring me a delicious slice of key lime pie to brighten my stay! I will definitely be aiming back to this hole in the wall Airbnb! Thank you Jane :)"
5129,78,"I appreciated Jane's eco-friendly, well-equipped studio. Jane's hospitality was top notch and location was convenient to local beaches and amenities. Bed was comfortable, the temperature was cozy, and I slept like a baby. Overall, had a wonderfully relaxing and enjoyable New Year's retreat. Would stay here again!"
5130,78,Jane made our stay comfortable and convenient. Communication with Jane was excellent. Perfect for me and my 10 year old son. Thank you!
5131,78,"Ditto all the 150 plus positive reviews about this studio and host. The studio is sweet, artsy, had everything I needed, a very comfortable feel and lots of things quietly tucked into niches such as books, nature guides and activities for children. A very calm gentle place to stay. Jane is a kind soul and an extraordinary host. I also appreciated her thoughtfulness in providing helpful support as needed."
5132,78,"Jane was very responsive, and friendly. The space was as described. It was lovely and clean! My husband and I were very comfortable there. It is small, but I think for a parent with a child, or a couple with a child it would be great.
There was no TV, but there were plenty of games and books to keep you entertained.
Thank you Jane for sharing your home!"
5133,78,Great place! Clean! Everything we needed. Convenient to everything
5134,78,Greatly enjoyed staying here. Very close to the beach & perfect fit.
5135,78,"Cozy, comfortable and quaint. I love all the extra beachy decorations and the wall you can draw on. Super cute! Will stay here again."
5136,78,"Great location, cute studio, perfect for a couple’s getaway trip. No tv was perfectly fine with us because we watched the 🏈Gamecocks beat Kentucky on YouTube. Whoohoo! 🤙"
5137,78,Awesome
5138,78,"Great location between OIB and Sunset! The space is cute and comfy, perfect for my sister and I to crash between our beach adventures!"
5139,78,"Fabulous host and a great place for a stay in the Ocean Isle area. Quaint and relaxing. All the amenities that you would need. Would definitely recommend for an overnight stay, as we did, or a few days also."
5140,78,"Perfect in so many ways. Location was great to the beach, shopping, restaurants, etc. Jane gives it that personal touch with providing everything you might need. Place was so relaxing. Perfect host!!!"
5141,78,this was a great place to stay. Quiet and relatively close to a lot of things
5142,78,"Great place to stay, very clean and Jane was super nice and helpful"
5143,78,Everything was absolutely perfect!
5144,78,"It was no trouble to find and the house number is perfectly visible from the street. It's well stocked with anything you could need. Jane is very attentive should you need anything during your stay. it's a peaceful, beautifully decorated space."
5145,78,Very nice place to stay and very relaxing! Had everything I needed that I forgot while packing! Super relaxing and homey. Would definitely recommend and hope to stay again!
5146,78,A very fun and enjoyable airbnb. Jane made the process as easy as can be. Would stay again
5147,78,"Jane was a lovely host who communicated wonderfully, location was quaint and cute and very close to all beaches and downtown calabash. Highly recommend!"
5148,78,"The stay was absolutely wonderful. The listing was accurate. You have full power of the central air, the shower and bathroom area are perfect as well. The beds are as soft as a marshmallow, its like sleeping on a cloud. The top loft gives person pretty much full privacy. Jane was very trustworthy, polite and leaves you to your privacy 100%. I'm not a big talker and she didn't make anything awkward, which means a great deal to some. The neighborhood is very peaceful and beautiful. Also the ambiance is wonderful, very ocean themed and no religious things around gawking at me. It felt like home. Thank you Jane. 😊 💓 hope to visit again."
5149,78,"Place is really ""cozy"" (small), no television, if traveling with a child over 12 the ""loft"" isn't ideal - really, really small plus the ladder to get to loft is a regular steel ladder that hurt your feet to climb on.
Also 2 nights either host's tv was on or she had guests - but it was loud and made it difficult to sleep.
The upside: it is close to Sunset beach and Jane is gracious with chairs, boogie boards, cooler, etc."
5150,78,"Sorry you feel that way, Lori. Many guests have stated how much they enjoy the loft and the ladder. As for your mention of the studio not having a tv, that is clearly stated in the listing. I'm not sure what guests and noise you are referring to. We did not have guests."
5151,78,Great place for a quick getaway! Close to both Sunset and Ocean Isle beach. Very clean suite that was well stocked with all the essentials!
5152,78,"Very quiet location, perfect for my short stay. Jane is a very conscientious host!"
5153,78,Very lovely place to stay. Neighborhood seems safe. Close to the beaches and Jane is very nice and caring.
5154,78,"Sweet spot for single traveler.
The bed was super comfortable."
5155,78,"We had a very sweet stay at Jane’s place! A true gem. Close to Sunset Beach & Ocean Isle- on our GPS it was about 8 min. to Sunset & 10 to Ocean Isle. Sunset beach is the best! The neighborhood around the studio felt very safe & quiet. Easy drive to both beaches. Jane had lots of games to play and beach items (including beach towels!) for adults & kids to use! Jane came to say hi when we arrived and that was a nice touch! She left a list of places to eat and menus for several places to order from. We didn’t need to reach out for help with anything while we were there, but she was so attentive to detail that I knew that if we needed her she’d be there to help!"
5156,78,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and were so impressed with the attention to detail in every inch of the space. It embodies everything that a stay at the beach should be! Would love to come here again😊
5157,78,This is a great location in a neighborhood a few minutes driving distance from the beach. It was very clean and comfortable.
5158,78,Jane is very welcoming and the room is very clean and cozy. Everything was perfect. 5 stars.
5159,78,"Jane was so accommodating! We were comfortable, and had everything we could hope to need, as well as things we wouldn't have even thought we needed. We used the foldable chairs and cooler at the beach multiple times. The board games she had on the shelves were a fun surprise. Would absolutely stay again!"
5160,78,The studio is greatly done. Jane is very accommodating also. It’s in a great safe area. Also very close to multiple beaches and activities!! Will stay again!
5161,78,"I have never been in more thoughtful Airbnb. There were games, toys, beach chairs, toothbrushes/toothpaste, and even floss! I was floored that Jane not only thought through everything a personally could possibly forget/need, but also decided to provide it as an amenity. The place was at an excellent location in a safe and lovely neighborhood, and our stay was nothing short of perfect and magical. To anyone thinking of booking janes place- don’t wait one second longer!"
5162,78,I highly recommend staying here! Jane's place is in an awesome location and has all the amenities you need. I only wish I'd been able to stay longer!
5163,78,Great place! Jane is a wonderful host. My daughter and I had a special time.
5164,78,"Perfect place to to launch from and land upon when enjoying the beach.

Comfortable and functional with thoughtful touches throughout the space. Efficient use of the square footage!"
5165,78,Very cute and clean
5166,78,"Five stars, all the way! Great location, perfect accommodations, everything someone would need, while on vacation. It's a compact space but the space is used so efficiently, there is everything you would need! Was super impressed and would stay again."
5167,78,"The studio apartment was perfect for our short stay. The decor in the apartment was tastefully done and gave a sense of peace and quiet. The location was within minutes of Sunset Beach, restaurants, and grocery stores."
5168,78,"Exactly what we needed! Clean and private, and a perfect location. Will look to stay here again if we come back to the area."
5169,78,Super cute place to stay! Jane is very friendly and responds and communicates extremely well! There was a cute little dry erase wall too with drawings from previous people who stayed and markers for you to draw which I thought was an adorable touch! Very homey feel!
5170,78,"Jane has created a whimsical and delightful studio with lovely beach colors, art, and a peaceful ambiance. Also impressive is the creative use of space.

It's a great location with beaches just minutes away, nice restaurants and grocery stores close by, and a short drive to N. Myrtle Beach for shopping, dining and entertainment.

A pleasant stay and a lovely host!"
5171,78,Jane was super sweet and the place was adorable. Super chill beach really close by and just a cute town over all!
5172,78,"We had so much fun staying at Jane’s studio! It was perfectly sized for a couple or couple with one child. Centrally located, you can get to everything you need easily! The colors were soothing and the owner Jane was thoughtful! She even gave my boyfriend a card for his birthday! We had a blast!"
5173,78,"Had a quiet and peaceful stay at Jane's beautiful Lil house. Loved the bed up in the loft, very comfy! Jane provided everything you would need, she even had beach chairs and towels. Great spot for a vacation close to the beach. Sweet Jane is definitely a SUPERHOST!!"
5174,78,Great atmosphere and very friendly host! Such a cute place to stay at!
5175,78,My second stay here. Cute place for a nice quiet night.
5176,78,Very cozy place. Had a cuteness to it and nice warm feel.
5177,78,"A small place that didn’t feel small at all.

This will be the first place I look the next time I am in Ocean Isle Beach."
5178,78,"I think it’s safe to say, this is the place to stay if you’re visiting the North Carolina coast. Jane is attentive and extremely kind. I loved this little studio and was so surprised and thankful to all the amenities that were offered along with it. A huge bonus is the fact this studio was beautifully decorated, which really made it feel like a home away from home. This will be at the top of my list when i choose to visit the coast again. thank you, Jane, for such a wonderful experience !!"
5179,78,"Very sweet, communicative, and understanding.:))"
5180,78,Such a great & quiet location!
5181,78,This is a perfectly sweet and comfy spot with an amiable and helpful host.
5182,78,Jane meticulously and lovingly thought of everything a traveler could want or need. She greeted me in the driveway and is very responsive by message as well. She has a drawing wall! So much fun! Unique stay as in not-corporate-or-stale-feeling. I really didn’t want to leave- just cozy and comfortable there.
5183,78,Great spot to rest up while you explore the area. Comfy and cozy with a very unique charm.
5184,78,Jane’s place was just as advertised. Nicely decorated and thoughtful amenities. Linens were good quality. We’d stay again!
5185,78,Thanks for the hospitality Jane. Had a wonderful birthday weekend. Highly recommend!!!
5186,78,Jane was a lovely host. Everything in this little getaway was perfectly appointed and attention to detail was paid at every turn. It was spotlessly clean and incredibly comfortable. I hated to leave! 10/10 would stay again.
5187,78,"Small, comfy place. Perfect for a few nights. Very nice host."
5188,78,"this is a hidden gem
so comfy and cozy with attention to all details, bed is comfortable, have your own thermostat too
it was a perfect overnight stay while in town for work"
5189,78,"Jane’s little studio is a bright cozy space with a nice comfy bed. It was perfect respite from my long drive. The space was very, very clean and cute! The location is wonderful! Close to great beaches that are good for families. I was there during the off season but they also don’t seem too touristy which is a bonus. Jane is an excellent host…like everyone in that area she is friendly and caring ❤️ It’s so wonderful to experience people like that in this day and age."
5190,78,Cute little place away from busy roads. We spent most of the weekend relaxing in the space and it was pretty quiet - we could sometimes hear a TV through the wall but it was not disruptive! On our last full day we went to the beach for a few hours and it was great to be able to come back and just crash for a while instead of having to drive hours back home. The loft bed ladder is a little rickety so not for clumsy folk. The space was very private.
5191,78,"This stay is everything you are thinking and more. First off Jane was absolutely responsive with all my messages. She made me feel as if I could reach out for anything. Now the space is beautiful. The way they have used the space is fantastic. It made me feel so safe. Jane had everything you could think of and more. Blow dryer, q tips, floss, tooth picks, tooth brush, extra toilet paper, cutting boards, reusable water bottle, utensils, endless outlets to use, water toys, towels, the list goes on. This was also the first Airbnb to proved the cutest and most helpful note made for ME. I highly recommend staying here. I would give it more than 5 stars if I could. I’m already planning my time back at this unique and peaceful location. My mind is still blown. Thank you Jane!"

5194,78,Great stay super close to the beach.
5195,78,"Janes place is in a fantastic area and a very neat spot. Has easy access and very private. I’ve stayed at a good bit of Airbnb’s in that last few years and this one has topped my list. Very neat, organized and just an overall cute little spot. Jane left easily to read instructions to you would not have to ask any question during your stay. Nice, quaint and comfy area and would definitely stay again!"
5196,78,Jane’s place is very cozy and a home away from home.
5197,78,Very sweet little getaway for my quick overnight trip! Adorably decorated and great location.
5198,78,A sweet find ! Secluded yet not far from a lot of activities & wonderful eateries.

5203,78,Great place to get away. Quiet and Quaint.
5204,78,"This airbnb is the cutest I have ever stayed in! We loved the wall that you can draw on and really appreciated all of the amenities! I’ve never stayed at an airbnb that was this stocked with towels, shampoo, conditioner, toothbrushes, pillows, etc. Jane is also incredibly generous to let guests use the numerous beach items that are available to you. 10/10 would stay here again!"
5205,78,"Thank you so much Nicole! I really appreciate your thoughtfulness,"
5206,78,"This is a very quaint home. Very close to the beach, with many restaurants close by. Very nice stay and I would recommend going here."
5207,78,Loved our time here Jane was super sweet
5208,78,"Loved this space by Jane!! Perfect for us two traveling down to Florida. It was clean, spacious, and had everything we could’ve needed! Also, the location was perfect!! Quiet neighborhood but only minutes drive to the beach."
5209,78,So happy we found this for our short trip to the beach! Loved the private entrance and that the room had a thermostat for temp control.
5210,78,"Jane's Airbnb was very clean and tidy. She also provided alot of extras, such as a list of local restaurants. The room was very cozy and inviting. I highly reccomend this Airbnb to solo travelers."
5211,78,Ms.Jane has the cutest stay that is a short drive to the beach! It was cozy and comfortable and I will definitely be keeping her place in mind for future beach stays!
5212,78,"Had an amazing stay. Would definitely recommend this little studio to anyone wanting to experience the local beaches. Jane was great, the studio was clean, and everything about the stay went very smoothly."
5213,78,Jane’s place felt just like home after a long day in the car. Jane has taken the time and thought to strategically place each item a guest would need on their stay. My only regret is I couldn’t stay longer. It is truly a rare find! Thanks Jane!
5214,78,Thanks Summer. Come to dinner next time!
5215,78,"Jane is an awesome host! Everything you could possibly need for your visit was included, including toothbrushes and beach chairs!
It was spotless and cozy and close to everything. I hope to visit again soon!"
5216,78,We was very pleased with the accommodation. The apartment very cozy. Super clean. The neighborhood is very quiet and beatiful. Jane is. very good hostess.

5220,78,"We really enjoyed our stay at Jane’s place. It’s a cozy, colorful, well-equipped space that is in a beautiful, quiet location close to tons of restaurants and shops. Jane’s close attention to even the small details made us feel welcomed and extremely comfortable. We would definitely stay here again."
5221,78,One of the coziest places I’ve stayed at. Had everything I need and didn’t feel like I needed any more space. I could’ve typed there for a few weeks if I wanted to.
5222,78,"Super clean, cozy space! Comfy bed, whimsical decor, easy access, parking, lots of little touches that made the stay even better!"
5223,78,"Wonderful place, great neighborhood, great host - what a pleasant 5 minute drive to sunset beach! We will definitely be returning next year, it was lovely and private and surprisingly stocked! Thank you Jane!"
5224,78,Jane has an amazing studio that we recommend! she gives amazing tips on food and places to go in the area. amazing hospitality.
5225,78,"This was our second stay at Jane’s studio, and she was, once again, a wonderful host! The studio is clean and adorably decorated. Jane has it stocked with everything you could possibly need for your stay. You will not be disappointed!"
5226,79,"The space was private and clean. Perfect amount of room for 2 people to enjoy the beach. The outside stairwell was a little loud in the mornings for people who like to sleep in. However, that did not affect our overall enjoyment. Thanks Alan!"
5227,79,"Great place to relax! First time in the area and I think it was perfect. My intention was to be in a quiet place, not crowded and it definitely matched the expectations!
The apartment is brand new, really cozy, I really recommend this place (they even have several table games!).

Alan was a great host, quick responses and willing to help in everything you need."
5228,79,"Location, location, location! We were looking for something close to the ocean… this place is on the ocean! The soothing sounds of waves can be heard all day, beach is lovely, and gorgeous sunrise and daily dolphin spotting from the balcony that puts you right on the water was beyond my dreams. The apartment is lovely, beds comfortable, and communication with Alan has been great. This is a gem and we look forward to returning!"
5229,79,I had a lovely stay here. The ocean was amazingg!
5230,79,This place is great! So close to the water. Beautiful views in the morning. Alan is a great host. Very responsive and helpful.
5231,79,"Our stay at Sacred Sands II was amazing! The condo was well decorated, super comfortable and had everything we needed to enjoy a relaxing long weekend. The balcony provides amazing ocean views. When I say amazing I truly mean amazing..you can hear the sound of the ocean all day and at high tide you truly feel like you are one with ocean. It was the perfect peaceful getaway.
The host, Alan was very communicative and responded super quick to our messages. He made the stay easy and wonderful.
I will definitely be referring Sacred Sands II to all my family friends as well as coming back in the near future."
5232,79,"I loved every second of my stay at Alan's Sacred Sands location!
The condo was a great size with a full kitchen, plenty of beds, a surplus of clean bedroom and bathroom linens, with a FANTASTIC view and wonderful neighbors in the other condos.
I spent so much time on the balcony watching the waves or walking on the northern part of the island. The kitchen had everything I needed to cook for the entirety of my stay, the bathroom was clean and had plenty of room, and all of the beds were very comfortable.
Alan communicated wonderfully and made my stay truly amazing. I will absolutely be back and I am recommending them to everyone that asks where they should stay on the island. I was wanting quiet and peaceful to spend five days on the ocean and I got exactly what I asked for! I can't wait to come back!"
5233,79,"Perfect amenities, easy check-in, clear directions, clean."
5234,79,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay at Sacred Sands! This was our first time at North Topsail, but won’t be our last! It was the perfect couples getaway! The condo was clean and comfortable and the view was out of this world— truly as oceanfront as you can get! The host, Alan, was very communicative and helpful which made our stay a breeze. Towels and sheets were provided and super clean. Bed and couch were comfy, too! We loved getting out on the beach, watching the waves and people fish, and reading a book. The best part was hearing the waves from the kitchen and living room at night! There is a little tiki bar right across the road that we also enjoyed walking over to! Very quiet and safe location. All-in-all a great stay- we hope to be back soon!"
5235,79,Great place Great Host! Clean and comfortable. Very peaceful balcony! Loved the high tide coming up to the steps! Would definitely stay again!
5236,79,"Great little condo, right on the beach! Alan was an excellent host. Check in and check out were easy. Loved being able to run right back to the unit from our spot on the beach for anything we forgot or to use the bathroom. Super cute space!"
5237,79,This unit was exactly what was advertised and Alan was extremely quick in his responses.
5238,79,"The location was perfect! As ocean front as you can get. The ocean is literally right in front of you and it’s so good for the soul. Quaintly decorated with decent kitchen supplies for all of your cooking needs. Good parking, too. The communication with the host was great, what a super nice guy! The cooling system wasn’t very good, it was humid inside and the condo smelled musty especially at first. Sometimes the neighbors were loud and woke us. Other than that, we really loved our stay and would most likely return."
5239,79,Our stay was beautiful and relaxing! A perfect place to visit for a family vacation or honeymoon
5240,79,Great location with a stunning view. With 2 adults and a child it was small but would be perfect for a couples retreat. Well stocked and only about 20 min from Surf City which we frequented often. Beaches aren’t too crowded at this location but watch out for high tide; it comes right up to the building and beach erosion is becoming an issue. There is constant construction going on to combat the beach erosion so something to anticipate if looking to stay in near future. Would recommend highly otherwise and would consider returning in the future.
5241,79,The place was beautiful and took alot of the stress out of the vacation. Our family enjoyed every minute. Highly recommend this for any beach family!
5242,79,"Truly a slice of heaven. So incredibly relaxing, peaceful and quiet. The ocean is truly amazingly. Highly recommend. Cannot wait to come back. My daughter cried bc she didn't want to leave. Thank you for sharing this piece of heaven!"
5243,79,This was absolutely one of the best vacations I’ve ever had. The house was super neat and clean. Always very attentive to questions and responded quickly. Highly recommend this location and would definitely go back!
5244,79,Perfect beach spot.
5245,79,"We had an awesome stay at Alan’s. He’s place was fantastic, great view!Had a little electric issue but he had it taken care of in the middle of the night on a weekend/holiday. Great communication, responded very quickly. We definitely recommend the place and would love to stay there again til our next vacation!"
5246,79,Overall we had a great stay! The apartment has everything you need for a perfect little getaway. The location is awesome and the tiki bar across the street is quite convenient.
5247,79,Great location! Right on the beach front. Quite area with a lot of nice locals.
5248,79,"Our stay at this condo was beyond our expectations. The unit was extremely clean and very welcoming. The instructions on how to get to the condo and how to access the condo and amenities were clear and concise. We arrived late at night. We were very comfortable and couldn't be happier about the location--walking distance to the beach was right under our feet! Wonderful views of the ocean and the Condo was very clean and cozy we will definitely go back!!!! The host was extremely attentive. Everything was as advertised! If you've been here before, this is the perfect place to stay. If you've never experienced sacred sand II get there soon!!!!"
5249,79,"Great host with attentive communication, great location, and the pics speak for themselves!"
5250,79,"Sweet little nook, nice to fall asleep to the sound of the ocean or drink a glass of wine."
5251,79,"Perfect location, cozy place with everything you need! We will be back!"
5252,79,"Expect a clean, fully furnished, great location to have an amazing relaxing time!"
5253,79,Where do I begin? My family & I have been so relaxed. This cozy condo felt like a home away from home. The views & the short distance to the beach brought tears of happiness. This was therapy & I'm so grateful for the experience. We'll be back again!
5254,79,lovely space and place!
5255,79,we had a great time!! highly recommend
5256,79,"Condo was exactly as expected from photos. Comfortable and serene. The deck receives morning and early afternoon sun which made the perfect spot for coffee and reading in tall deck chairs or couch. Accessing condo was easy using a touch pad entry code. Alan responded to all communication very quickly.
High tide was initially unnerving since it comes so close to the building structures. Large sandbags have been placed in front of condo buildings so this is not a spot to enjoy the beach but there is plenty of space just steps from Alan’s unit. There’s a rustic Tiki bar and small store across street from condo building and an amazing beach 1/2 mile away at the tip of N Topsail. We will definitely revisit Topsail in the future!"
5257,79,Great location with a beautiful view! The condo was adorable! Would highly recommend!
5258,79,Perfect location by the beach!
5259,79,"Alan's place was fantastic. He allowed us to move our dates and was very flexible with our schedules. Very easy self check in and an amazing place, literally ON the beach. His place is within 20 minutes of shops and groceries with a little mini Mart right across the street (although there aren't any hours on the door so it may be closed at odd hours). Very reponsive and amazing host. We will definitely stay here again!"
5260,79,"This is such a cute condo right on the beach with a stunning view of the ocean! It’s a scenic drive into town over the bridge and a good coffee/bagel shop nearby. This is a very peaceful spot for a spring break vacation here, and Alan was helpful and communicative."
5261,79,"This is the perfect little beach getaway. Small, but very clean, thoughtfully supplied and beautifully decorated, and the view is unbeatable. We truly felt we were right on the beach. Even inside the apartment, you could always hear the waves! I would definitely come here again, and highly recommend booking Alan's place if you're looking for a relaxing vacation. I was also impressed with the clear & detailed communication regarding check-in and check-out, which made for a totally stress-free experience."
5262,79,We loved this condo!
5263,79,"Cute, clean and fantastic view!!!"
5264,79,We loved our stay! Saw so many dolphins and found so many treasures on the beach. The location is perfection. I’ve never stayed so close to the water! The condo had everything we needed to enjoy our visit and we look forward to our next stay!!
5265,79,"Loved the space, location, & rate. Great value & great communication from host.
My toddlers & I enjoyed the beach & sunrises on the balcony. We saw dolphins in the mornings.
Enjoyed our 3 day stay & tried to extend but it was booked. Get it while you can!"
5266,79,Never spent the night so close to the ocean (and I am from the coast of Southern California)! Recommended for everyone to experience! Hosts were wonderful! Place has everything you need! Prices are just right!
5267,79,The place is very cute and the location is amazing. There are dolphins right outside the back door multiple times per day. Very peaceful. Quiet other than the waves crashing 🙂🌊
5268,79,Great place to stay especially if you like the sound of the ocean and watching dolphins. Short walk to the inlet where you can drive on the beach.
5269,79,"It was a Christmas to remember!
We changed up our Christmas routine this year and headed for the best view we could fine. This condo delivered!
The house was well stocked with the essentials household/kitchen items.
The couch on the porch was my favorite spot! If you set just right it will cut the sun and you can just watch the waves roll in while having your coffee.
We have 2 kids and they were more than excited about the bunk beds.
The kids give them a good review for comfort and the master was nice as well.
The kitchen is small in size but very user friendly. My husband cooked a prime rib to perfection.
You definitely have to watch the tides to go out on the beach but never felt we were missing out.
Overall it was exactly what I was expecting and very easy transaction. Thank you!"
5270,79,The location was great! We enjoyed watching the dolphins from the balcony; we saw them every day. Beach access was very convenient which was great with a little one. It was relaxing to hear the waves just outside! The condo was well-stocked and had the things we needed for our stay. We enjoyed our visit and would stay here again!
5271,79,"We had the best time at Alans condo on the ocean!!!!!
It was awesome. The dolphins, the waves, the fishing boats, and our wonderful military!!!
We cant wait to return!!!"
5272,79,"We had a nice stay over the Thanksgiving holiday. We loved being right on the beach, the sound of the surf and seeing the stars at night. The boys enjoyed seeing the dolphins in the early morning. We cooked breakfast. We found food nearby and towards Snead’s Ferry and Surf city. We enjoyed seeing the Beasley Turtle rescue center. We took a one hour trip to Wilmington to see the USS North Carolina. It was a good for for us and the two boys. The WiFi worked well for work and streaming."
5273,79,"Nice, quiet and clean condo. Really enjoyed our short getaway. I’ve never stayed so close to the water! It was awesome:)"
5274,79,This trip was one of my favorites. I could sit and watch the ocean all day. The first night we did see at least 20 dolphins swim by. The sunrise and sunsets were amazing. I was surprised to see just how far and fast the tide would rise so be aware of that. The condo was comfy and quiet. And Alan and his family were amazing hosts even answering questions on the day he brought home a new baby!! I would certainly come again!
5275,79,"This place is as close to the water as you can get without actually being in it. This small, simple, clean, and very quiet place was just what I needed. It was very peaceful and the boat-tailed Grackles were a delight (they may land on the balcony to visit). The apartment has everything you need and the bed was one of my most comfortable beds I have ever slept on while at any airbnb. It is obvious that these hosts care very much about their guests."
5276,79,perfect spot to rest and enjoy the beach
5277,79,Great location with the beach just a few steps away. Condo was simple and clean. Enjoyed a nice couple days fishing and walking along the beach.
5278,79,Alan is a great host and very attentive. If you have ever wanted to stay RIGHT ON THE WATER then this is the place!!! The views are amazing!
5279,79,We will definitely be back! Everything was perfect and the view is Amazing!! Alan was very nice and he was quick to reply if we had questions. I can't recommend this Condo enough! The price was great and we are already looking forward to returning.
5280,79,"This condo was great!! Doesn't get much more ocean front, and the hospitality was incredible."
5281,79,"We had a wonderful stay! Alan was helpful, communicative and kind. We LOVED the quiet beach, chill atmosphere of the condo community, and the sea creatures and abundant wild life. The dolphins were a family favorite. You can’t beat the view! The beach was amazing with tons of options nearby. We enjoyed having a rental car to checkout local restaurants and shops. We highly recommend staying here and know you’ll have a great stay!"
5282,79,"This place is amazing. The fact that it’s RIGHT on the water was heavenly. If you’re coming for beach views you will definitely get them. I think the location it a smidge far from parts of the “downtown” restaurants and bars but If that’s not your vibe it’s great! Quiet, clean and great views."
5283,79,"Although our stay at Sacred Sand II was cut short by a death in the family, the time we spent there was wonderfully nourishing. The sound of the surf right off our deck was both energizing and relaxing. We found the presence of military helicopters more intriguing than obtrusive, and it was nice to be far removed from the touristy strip malls.
With every accommodation at our fingertips, we fell into a stress-free routine: coffee before sunrise, a long walk on the beach, breakfast, some reading, a swim, dinner in the giant blue chairs, a couple of episodes of Modern Family, and sometimes a twilight stroll. As a result, we showed up for the funeral tanned and exercised, still hearing the echo of those rolling waves."
5284,79,"Great location!
Host has awesome communication skills!"
5285,79,"First and foremost, Alan was a wonderful host! Very polite and so easy to communicate with. We had a small snafu, but Alan was quick to respond and made sure the rest of our stay would be comfortable. The location is perfect. Just far enough away from everything to feel secluded, but not so far that it’s a hassle to commute. The house we clean and inviting. THE VIEW! The view literally could not be any better. Sitting on the balcony at high tide just watching the waves roll in basically under your feet was incredible and relaxing. I would recommend this place to anyone and would most certainly stay again!"
5286,79,"Everything about our stay at Sacred Sands II was amazing! The condo was very clean, comfortable, and well stocked with everything we needed. Access to the beach, association amenities, and the views all made for a beach vacation that certainly raised the bar for any future beach trip! The laid back, relaxed vibes of the area were exactly what we were looking for to rest and recharge. Alan was so kind and communicative, and gave us some great recommendations for local food and sights to see. We were so sad to leave, but we’re already planning our next trip back!"
5287,79,"Great place to stay. Loved being right on top of the beach, my fiancé and I had everything we needed for a weekend getaway. We would definitely stay here again!"
5288,79,"Perfect little beachfront spot for my husband, baby & I! Truly just a step onto the beach & you’re ready to relax! Host was very responsive & helpful. Highly recommend!"
5289,79,The place was exactly what we expected. With two children it was so much easier to stay on the beach and run back to our place when needed. We fell in love in TOPSAIL!!!
5290,79,"Our family of four had a great time staying at sacred sands. The condo was clean, cute and very well appointed. The condo is right on the coast with access to a lovely stretch of beach. We had some great meals at surf city and loved the drive down to topsail beach and serenity point."
5291,79,"High recommend Sacred Sand II; you could not ask for a better host or location. The pictures provided simply do not do justice to the beautiful and peaceful location. Alan and his wife have provided a cozy, comfortable, clean, and stylish condo with all the essentials you may need for a family vacation. The bunks in the hallway were the perfect touch for my girls, they loved them. Alan is a wonderful host. Throughout our stay, he was reachable at all times if a problem arises, along with providing suggestions for first-time Topsail visitors. We hope to return back next year."
5292,79,"We had a wonderful relaxing week at sacred sand II! The pictures do not lie, you are so very close to the ocean! We loved how easy it was to grab a few chairs and hit the beach any time of day in minutes. There was alway plenty of room and the stretch by this building is much less inhabited than those farther south.
Alan answered all our questions quickly and was an awesome host.
I recommend hanging on the deck at dusk to watch the ghost crabs come out from the dunes. They are comical & adorable, especially the babies. Bring a flashlight in case you want to hit the beach at night.
The condo has all the basics for cooking, all you need to bring is your food. We ate in the majority of our stay after hitting the local farmers stand andrews produce -highly recommend it!
North topsail beach is the best and we are already looking forward to returning next year."
5293,79,"Alan was very responsive with any problems we had and was willing to make up for the problems we encountered. The Only issue was some of the dishes were not clean, other than that it’s a prime location. Best spot you can get!! This Town and area was very LGBTQ+ friendly, not many masks worn around. Dinner at splash by the sea was amazing and definitely worth the short drive!!"
5294,79,Alan is a great host. Amazing location right on the beach. Bar/ convenience store right across the street. Very clean and couldn’t ask for a better experience.
5295,79,Great location for beach time. It’s about a 25 minute drive to restaurants and shops. The condo is nice and comfortable.
5296,79,"Great place to stay with great views, great location, and cute decor. Had different games and good TV channels for inside entertainment. The place was well put together and clean. Check in process was super simple. Alan was really responsive with a minor glitch in our stay, which did not affect our vacation at all. I would definitely stay again in the future."
5297,79,"The unit was amazing! The kitchen had all the utensils you might need. The bathroom and shower were super nice. And just overall, it was perfect. The location on the water is so beautiful! You can see high and low tide come in and out and the beach is amazing!"
5298,79,"Very Clean. Decorated really cute.
Comfortable with a lot of xtra touches!!!
The host is awesome as well :)
Will stay again if available when in area!"
5299,79,Alan is a great host. His place is great and has a wonderful view.
5300,79,"This is a wonderful condo for a small family, it was a bit challenging with a toddler. But the condo is very clean and we could ask for a better view for drinking coffee. The beach is a little difficult to enjoy unless the tide is out but we still had out fair share of fun"
5301,79,We stayed at Sacred Sands for our honeymoon and it was beautiful! Alan left us a lovely card and bottle of wine which was a great surprise! The views were breathtaking and we were even lucky enough to watch the dolphins swimming right outside from the balcony! It was the perfect place to stay for our little getaway!
5302,79,"Worth every penny, we really enjoyed our romantic getaway. Everyone was friendly, direct access to the beach, I mean it was literally right there. The only regret is we couldn't stay longer.

Thomas"
5303,79,We LOVED Alan’s place! It was exactly as described. Alan was VERY responsive to any questions we had. When we advised we were visiting Wilmington for a day he was open to may great suggestions!! We had a quick issue that was totally out of anyones control and it was resolved in MINUTES! Alan truly is one of the greatest hosts we had the pleasure of working with through Airbnb. I would highly recommend him to all my family and friends and we are 100% looking to go back next April and make this a yearly trip!
5304,79,"Great little place, perfect for our little family getaway. Proximity to Surf City without the hustle and bustle was wonderful."
5305,79,"Location, location, location. It does not get any better than this. The views of the sunrise over the ocean and of dolphins alone were enough to make this worth the price. The condo is small, but very cozy and we loved the cute, beachy decor. It was also spotlessly clean. The beds were comfortable and we slept great. Alan, the host, was very quick to respond anytime I sent him a message. We had an issue that came up that we thought might cause us to have to cancel our stay, and he was very helpful. Fortunately, things worked out. He suggested local restaurants for us to eat at, too. His instructions for arrival and departure were very detailed. Everything was exactly as advertised. We enjoyed many long walks on the beach and listening to the sounds of the surf. I highly recommend this place. The price is very reasonable, too."
5306,79,"Perfect beach getaway for our family of 4. Great location, unbelievable views. We'll be back!"
5307,79,"This was hands down, the BEST vacation of my entire life! Alan is an AMAZING host, and you just couldn't ask for more. Everything was absolutely WONDERFUL!! I will definitely be looking to stay here again! Top notch people and a top notch place of beauty and tranquility."
5308,79,"This place was amazing!!! The balcony was definitely our absolute favorite spot every day! It was so peaceful looking out over the ocean and when the tide was high it felt like we were hovering over the water. On our first day there we were able to see at least 15 dolphins swimming and jumping through waves! Waking up and enjoying our coffee while listening to the ocean and watching the pelicans soar was so serene, especially when the sky is clear and you can watch the stunning sunrise. The location is perfect since it's right near touristy areas like Surf City but secluded as well. It was so much fun finding many local seafood markets nearby. We drove maybe 20 minutes to get to Midgett's Crab market and we were able to come back and cook a seafood boil with local blue crabs, bay scallops, and shrimp and enjoyed eating it out on the balcony thanks to the bartop table out there! It was hard to leave this wonderful condo and go back to reality but it was definitely the beach therapy we needed and we can't wait to visit many more times :)"
5309,79,Very clean and wonderful views of the dolphins! Will recommend to anyone coming to visit!
5310,80,"This is a great location! The house is clean, and beautiful views!!!"
5311,80,"Me and my girlfriends really enjoyed this house. It was perfect for us. The oceanfront views are amazing. Lots of windows and natural light. House was well stocked with things you need like toiletries, linens, and kitchen items. Beds were very comfortable. Slept great. Sabine was very helpful and responsive. We loved it. Would do it again!!"
5312,80,"Beach house was a perfect breakaway trip for the 3 of us. Scenery is spectacular, we were able to see both the sunrises and sunsets from the deck which was extraordinary! Amenities were just what was described. The beds were comfortable too. Only regret is that we stayed here 2 nights and not longer. We didn’t want to leave. And oh. Sabine is a great communicator and very efficient too! A+++ place to rent!"
5313,80,"We absolutely loved our stay!! Would recommend this place to everyone!! It was peaceful and beautiful, and has everything we needed"
5314,80,"We really enjoyed our stay, especially being right on the beachfront! We had a lot of fun although it was a little more chilly than anticipated! Aside from the cold weather, the only things I found to be odd were having to bring our own laundry pods, the toiletry items that were provided were the very tiny bottles of body soap, shampoo, and conditioner, and there weren’t many trash bags to replace with. Aside from that it was great and we would go back!"
5315,80,Loved staying here! Very cozy place with a lovely porch overlooking the ocean. Thank you to Sabine for being friendly and helpful!
5316,80,"We had a beautiful time at Sabine's beach house. Listening to the ocean, walking the beach, and checking out Southport were just a few highlights. Sabine is a caring and very responsive host. She gave very clear and friendly instructions and shared awesome recommendations for local activities. Highly recommended!"
5317,80,"Sabine was a great host; helpful, responsive, communicative, and a great addition to Airbnb! I will 100% stay here again, and if you’re traveling here, I recommend staying with Sabine and her beautiful home!"
5318,80,"Sabine’s place is perfect. Comfortable, clean, and beautiful location. Ideal beach stay."
5319,80,The house was so close to the ocean! Everything was as described and the house rules were easy to follow. I was glad I reviewed early and made sure to pack beach towels and blanket as there were no extras to take to the beach. We arrived at night so the flexible check in was convenient. We experienced an air conditioning problem and Sabine replied within minutes having notified a maintenance crew and it was resolved timely. Everything was clean and well maintained. We stayed four nights and had one towel/washcloth per person with no towel in the bathroom and it would have been helpful to have additional washcloths. The kitchen had all the basics for making meals or there are many delicious restaurants close by. Listening to the waves was so enjoyable and our experience on the ocean was amazing.
5320,80,Sabine was wonderful and responsive. The house was very clean. We loved the location and the house and we were even able to see dolphins!
5321,80,My family and I loved our stay at sabines. Can’t beat ocean front. She was super communicative and helpful. The place was clean and had everything we needed to have an enjoyable weekend. Thank you!
5322,80,"My family and I left snowy weather and arrived at the beach house of our dreams! The house had everything we needed. We grilled outside for most of our dinners. The deck provided us with both sunrise and sunset views as well as dolphin sightings! With three kids ages 5-11 it was wonderful being right on the beach. We walked to the pier, collected shells and my kids even swam! One day we drove to the lighthouse and then drove to the point at the other end of the island! It is small enough, we wanted to check out the whole thing, but really we were eager to get back to the beach. We all hope to visit again!"
5323,80,"Great location, great view, comfortable accommodations. Probably the best bed and bedding of any air BnB I have stayed at."
5324,80,Location was great just few steps to the beach. Great interior space and very clean. Good internet and guests have a streaming account.
5325,80,"The place was nicely decorated, spacious, clean and man what a view."
5326,80,great stay!! beautiful ocean views. it was very clean and we had everything we needed. would highly recommend a stay here!
5327,80,"Thank you, Sabine. I enjoyed my stay and appreciated the little touches like the binoculars, the artful way the towels were presented, a tea kettle and SHARP KNIVES! Amazing! I usually travel with my own. The bed was comfortable, the view was perfect. A nice, quiet space to spend time."
5328,80,Great for a quick 3 day getaway had everything we needed and very clean
5329,80,Enjoyed our couples stay! Home was very clean and had everything we needed. Easy check-in. Very prompt in communication. Would definitely stay here again!!
5330,80,"You will not be disappointed in this unit! Beautiful views, fully stocked kitchen, comfortable beds, and very clean! Would 100% stay here again."
5331,80,"Great spot for a quiet few days at the beach. Right on the beach. Quieter end of Oak Island so a short drive to restaurants etc., Worth the compromise to have the peace and quiet. Great communication throughout the stay. Easy to find and access. The place had all the amenities needed for a short stay. Would highly recommend."
5332,80,Wonderful view and location!!
5333,80,Perfect place to spend Thanksgiving - Sabine was very helpful and responsive!
5334,80,"This place was ideal for simple weekend getaway trip to spend lots of time on the beach. The owner is very responsive to questions, and the space had all the basic amenities one would need."
5335,80,"If you’re looking for an oceanfront place to stay at in Oak Island, look no further. This place was perfect for my fiancé and I’s vacay. The location is great- restaurants, grocery stores, and shops are only a short drive away. The beach house is very clean, quiet and peaceful. Wifi works well if you’re working remotely like I was. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our visit and would book this place again!"
5336,80,Good stay.
5337,80,Great location! Super clean! Loved it! Would love to stay again!!
5338,80,The location was 5 star! You can’t beat the views and easy access to the beach. Check in and communication was super easy and the place was exactly as described. One thing to note as this may matter to anyone with small children is that the there is no access to the bathroom except from the two rooms. We had two children in the double room and a baby in the king room with us so it was a minor inconvenience but worth noting!
5339,80,We had a wonderful stay and would stay again !
5340,80,"Sabine’s house is lovely and right on the beach. Sabine supplies all the paper products you would need and some shampoo, conditioner and lotion if you needed it. The kitchen is well stocked with dishes, silverware, pots and pans. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit."
5341,80,"The house was great, the communication was stellar and the views both sunrise, sunset and of the ocean were amazing!"
5342,80,This place was perfect for a family of 4! Right on the beach and steps away from beach access! All amenities were provided and Sabine is a great communicator! Highly recommend!
5343,80,"Our stay at Sabine's beach home was incredible! The house was well stocked and very clean. And of course the location could not be beat. For one, oak island has one of the most gorgeous shorelines I've ever been to but also being able to go down to the beach without having to lug tons of stuff around meant we spent so much more time there. A few things... If you're able to I recommend booking the lower level because on those warm days we could have used shade on the deck. Also, this listing does not provide beach towels. Plan ahead because the towels you can buy nearby are pricey. And finally, buy yourself some food to stock up on because, trust me, you'll hardly want to leave!"
5344,80,Great comfy bed
5345,80,"We wanted a mini vacation before school starts back up, and this home was perfect for us! It’s a perfect size for our family of four, it’s steps from the beach, and close enough to everything else on the island you want to do. Sabine was quick to let me know of issues with the keypad before check in, and she checked in a couple times to make sure everything was okay and going well. She’s the perfect host! We would love to stay again sometime!"
5346,80,"Sabine was a wonderful host with great communication. The beach house is spacious, clean, & in a prime location. The deck ocean front views are amazing. We had a relaxing, peaceful stay. I’d certainly recommend this stay to others."
5347,80,Our stay in Oak Island was everything we were hoping for and then some. The location was perfect — right on the water with beach access immediately to the left and the right. The house had everything we needed to make this feel like home for our family (of 5).
5348,80,"We had a great stay at Sabine beach house. Just as advertised, you can get any closer to water. short drive to Publix for groceries and restaurants in the area."
5349,80,Beautiful!
5350,80,"Unbeatable location! Right on the beach -- beautiful view from the porch. If you're looking for a super convenient location, this is a great choice."
5351,80,"Unbeatable location if you want to be on the beach. All was as described and pictured. Well equipped and clean. This is a great place for a small family or couple. Sabine's communication, instructions, and recommendations were top notch. Oak Island is an especially chilled community to visit. Highly recommended."
5352,80,Awesome place. Perfect for two couples. Great ocean views
5353,80,"Excellent correspondence from Sabine before and during our stay! We had a wonderful stay with our family of 5 (3 younger children), the house was just big enough for all of us. The location and beach access was great. Five stars!"
5354,80,What a wonderful stay! Great location and Sabine is a wonderful host. She is so helpful from the moment you book your reservation. The place was very clean!! Highly recommend.
5355,80,"Great location, great place and great host! We definitely recommend. If we’re back this way, we’ll definitely try to stay here again."
5356,80,"Location is amazing and perfect view from the balcony!
Having young kids, we loved being able to walk back and forth to the beach with ease!"
5357,80,"Great spot on a quiet stretch of beach, clean and updated house, super nice and responsive host. Seemed well insulated between floors (duplex format) as we never heard the people below us. Convenient store one block away."

5362,80,Sabine is an attentive host who communicates very well. We brought our 1 year old to the beach for the first time and were able to set her up in the other bedroom. Location was perfect as well! Highly recommend!
5363,80,Excellent communication and the house has very clean. Already looking to book for next year!

5365,80,We had an incredible weekend at Sabine’s beach front property. The place was super clean and had a fully stocked kitchen. The best part was the amazing beach views and access to the beach right in front of the home. We would highly recommend Sabine’s home for your next vacation!!
5366,80,Everything was great and exactly as advertised!! A great trip

5375,80,"We were here for only about 12 hours, but what a great beach getaway spot!"
5376,80,"This is our second time staying here and we absolutely love it! Very clean, great location, convenient parking and check in!"
5377,80,"Absolutely best beach vacation ever and the house had a huge open deck in the top floor that had amazing views of the beach. The walkout to the beach was just below and over the new dunes was a beautiful beach!
All the essentials were there ready for us and our host was very responsive.

Sabine is wonderful 💕"

5387,80,"Awesome place with fantastic beach view and access. Very convenient. Quiet stretch of beach close enough to stores and restaurants to be easy access, but far enough away that it was never crowded. Never so much as heard the people staying in the unit below us so the insulation was great. Felt very private. Stayed there with our two kids and it was perfect."

5393,80,"This location is absolutely perfect. The house is mere steps from the beach and the view from the upper deck is perfection. We loved being able to step right onto the beach everyday. The interior was comfortable, though it is small (especially the bathroom). It was close enough to restaurants and stores, while still being in a quiet area. Would definitely recommend."
5394,80,The view of the ocean is really great! Easy access to the beach. Very clean and cute beach decorations. It was really nice and we really enjoyed our stay!!
5395,80,"This is the perfect family place specially if two families rent both units which is what we did. Clean, beautiful, peaceful. It was the most amazing family vacation we had in a long time. Owners and neighbors look after each other and you feel safe. Thanks again for your quick response to our requests and we definitely look forward to another stay. Blessings"
5396,80,"Sabine was a great host. She responded to any questions quickly, and everything in the house was as pictured. The location was perfect, as it was right on the beach with a pathway to walk out onto the beach. I would definitely recommend staying here!"
5397,80,"This house was perfect for a girls trip weekend! Right on the beach, the location couldn’t have been better. Very clean and the hosts were just a message away! Highly recommend!"
5398,80,This is a beautiful home with an amazing view. My highlight was drinking coffee on the deck and watching a dolphin pod play in the waves. Next time we will book the first floor so we won’t worry our children are stomping to loud above the other guest. We didn’t have any complaints and the other guest had children we never heard either and that speaks volumes for an insulation job well done.
5399,80,This was just the perfect place to stay at Sabine is the sweetest and the place was ready for me before time! ☺ if you love waking up to a beautiful view of the beach ⛱ this is your spot. 😊👍🏽
5400,80,"The view is beautiful. The house was so nice. Very easy to get to the beach esp with kids.... the water was amazing and never rough- even in may which was lovely. we made such good memories catching ghost crabs, finding sand crabs and checking out jellyfish. I would definitely stay here again. Staying here affirmed my desire to own a place at the beach myself one day 💚"

5403,81,Wonderful and cute!
5404,81,This place was a wonderful addition to my roadtrip on the way to Pennsylvania. It was so peaceful and relaxing. I loved sitting out on the porch and it had all the amenities you needed to cook and feel right at home. I also appreciated the great attention to detail and organization in the home. Thank you to the owners for creating such a wonderful sanctuary.
5405,81,Riley's spot was exactly what I needed for a 24 hour escape from reality. The house was adorable and the screened in porch was perfect for enjoying coffee/breakfast on a beautiful morning. I will definitely be back the next time I need a retreat!

So grateful we had the opportunity to stay here!"

5412,81,"Riley and Gaby were great hosts! Their tiny home was immaculate and beautiful. If you're in the RDU area, be sure to check this one out."
5413,81,"Great location, cozy cabin getaway with easy access to city living in Durham"
5414,81,I needed a place to stay away from home to do some writing. This was the perfect quiet spot. Very restful and peaceful.
5415,81,Lovely place. Felt secluded but still close to a lot of things to do. Thanks for having me!
5416,81,Absolutely beautiful spot- inside and out! Riley was a great communicator and offered some excellent local recommendations. I would love to stay here again in the future!
5417,81,"Riley’s place was a beautiful, clean, light filled oasis tucked away in the woods but close to downtown Durham.

The stay itself was great. The home has everything you could need and the hosts even gave us some Durham toffee as a welcome gift which was delicious ! The hosts were so responsive and communicative making everything from check in to parking to check out simple and stress-free. I would give this spot a 1000000/10 highly recommend to anyone on their next getaway in the Durham area !"
5423,81,The place was super cute! Only thing we thought was a book with local places to try would’ve been nice and maybe a deck of cards!
5424,81,"It is a wonderful tiny home to stay while visiting the Triangle.
Nested in nature and loved listening to the birds in the mornings."
5425,81,"We enjoyed our stay in their lovely home. Very friendly and welcoming hosts, their home was as beautiful as described."
5426,81,"This space is exactly as pictured and advertised. Walking through the space it is incredibly clean with added touches to ensure that the space was prepared just for you. Although I was only here for the night, the kitchen appeared well stocked if you wanted to cook your own meal during your stay. Enjoying a cup of coffee in the sun room and reading a book in the swing are just such nice touches you really can’t beat! You get a nice woodsy, outdoorsy feel while still being right within the neighborhood . Very accessible to Chapel Hill/UNC/Duke with lots of greats options for exploring the area! Would’ve loved to stay longer and absolutely recommend!"
5427,81,The accommodations were exactly as described - a tiny house amongst the trees. It was a hard place to leave as it was lovely to just sit and enjoy the natural light that filtered in. A very nice spot with great hosts.
5428,81,"Words can’t describe my time spent at Riley’s tiny house, I felt right at home and welcomed. The home is very well kept and there were so many near by amenities like restaurants/parks/entertainment. I had no issues with my stay whatsoever and would definitely book this spot again!

5430,81,We really enjoyed our stay and we might come again!
5431,81,"Riley’s place was absolutely beautiful! We really enjoyed all the aspects of the tiny house, the loft and the screened in porch were my favorite things. Riley was also a VERY attentive host and super friendly. We really loved this place and are very happy with our decision to stay here! The only thing I would have preferred is if there was more of a yard space for the dog to use the bathroom, we usually had to take him for actual walks to fully do his business. Which isn’t at all an issue but definitely glad we had prepared for that with long leads and what not. Overall it was a really nice stay and Riley was a really awesome host. Bonus, we met his new rescue puppy, Lasso. Thanks for everything Riley ❤️🐾"
5432,81,"While this place was not in the middle of nowhere, it definitely felt like we had our privacy and the home was tucked away in its own little section of the woods.

5438,81,"If I could give this place a 10 star review, I would! Riley and Gaby were both lovely. The place was secluded, spotless, and the perfect getaway without actually being away from civilization and things to do. The place is even better than the pictures - don’t think twice about booking. We can’t wait to be back."
5439,81,small But still spacious in the inside felt like we were in the woods love the porch
5440,81,Booked Riley’s place last minute while we were traveling through the area and wow what a find! Really cool modern vibe. Super clean and close to anything you need as well. We (& our dog) had a very relaxing time and would definitely book again if we’re ever back in the area.

5446,81,The location and house was beautiful! Will definitely stay again.
5447,81,Great stay & great hosts!
5448,81,Fantastic little location surrounded by trees. Contemplative tranquility but 10 minutes by cab from downtown Durham. Check out Motorco Music Hall and the Fullsteam Brewery. Wish I had been able to stay longer.

Wish we would have stayed longer."
5452,81,"We loved the style, decor, amazing landscaping, and all the amenities. The owner was friendly and responsive; it is clear they take pride in their property."
5453,81,Better than we could’ve asked for. Riley and Gaby were extremely responsive and available for anything we might have needed during our stay. It was secluded while also being 10 minutes away from some great shopping centers and restaurants in Durham. Great place to get away and would highly recommend.
5454,81,great little spot! fun for a little get away.
5455,81,We had an amazing time! It was our first tiny home experience and we count have asked for a better one! We definitely will be staying again!

5459,81,The house was everything it looked to be and more… very good energy in the house very calming… very spacious for its size and has everything you will need to getaway but not too far from places if you want to get out as well… they were in communication from the start and very responsive… helped with local eating suggestions and things to do around the city… my next visit I will be staying here again thanks for the hospitality
5460,81,Great stay overall!!
5461,81,"Absolutely magical place to rest, work and play! This tiny home is truly one of a kind and very thoughtfully designed. Loved it!"
5462,81,"Despite being a tiny home, it still contains all the essentials + more. Very beautifully architected and located very close to shopping / food / drink / events / things to do. Hosts are very communicative and want to help you have a great time! Durham is a unique place, and having a unique place to stay adds to the entire experience."
5463,81,We loved our stay! The place is very thoughtfully decorated and nestled into the trees. It was so relaxing waking up to the wind or rain in the trees and we loved how tropical the landscaping was. It made the stay feel very private and cozy.
5464,81,"True peace and tranquillity in a natural environment with easy access to great restaurants and activities! We loved our stay, just wanted to get away for our anniversary. Riley was very responsive yet hands off. We appreciated the ease of checking in and out, but most of all, coming home to our tiny bit not too tiny escape among the trees."
5465,81,"Wonderful place, we’d happily stay again!"
5466,81,"Riley and Gaby were both super prompt, kind and very helpful! Their tiny home is the perfect blend of wooded and secluded but still close to the city and civilization. Perfect place to escape! Great for solo travelers or a couple! The location was easy to find and check in was smooth."

5469,81,"A pretty great stay!
I loved the way they shied away from the typical Keurig and had a French press, the way the house was nestled in plants and felt truly in the middle of a forrest while being within suburbia, and the pillows! it was comfortable all around and the attention to detail felt welcoming and unique."
5470,81,"Great experience, house was as good as advertised"
5471,81,"Very clean, supplied with more than everything you’d need and perfect for 2 people. Everything was 5 mins away"
5472,81,This home was nice to stay at. Very quiet and relaxing. Had many windows that allowed the sounds of nature to lull us to sleep. Comfortable stay.
5473,81,This place is a really special spot and exactly as described. We had an excellent week here and would come back in a heartbeat!
5474,81,Truly an amazing stay! The attention to detail and care in providing a cozy stay was evident. Riley and Gaby were both readily available if needed if any questions or concerns arose. We will definitely be returning!
5475,81,Great house! Very clean and comfy to stay in. Super accommodating and communicative hosts will be sure to help in any way possible. Parking is shared with other homes nearby but spaces are marked separate. Nice environment and nature with plenty of sounds and plants to watch from the outdoor seating. Cozy
5476,81,"This tiny home was perfect for our visit to the Raleigh/Durham area. It was super cute, very clean, in a convenient/safe location, and the owner was very hospital. He gave us local recommendations to the area and was very accommodating. We plan to return in the future."
5477,81,"So beautiful and magical! We had thunderstorms both nights which were so cool to see from both inside and outside. Was truly like a treehouse in the rainforest. It was quiet at night, and very very romantic of a spot. Everything was great!"
5478,81,"This is such an AMAZING and UNIQUE stay! Riley was such a great host and incredibly accommodating! So helpful! Overall, beautiful tiny home and quiet neighborhood! Already planning my next stay!"
5479,81,I loved this tiny house so much! It is so peaceful and quiet but yet close enough to town if you need something. Perfect stay for business or a weekend getaway. Such a cute place! Riley is a wonderful host and I would stay here again. Thanks again!
5480,81,"My husband and I absolutely loved our time at this tiny house. We felt worlds away from the hustle and bustle of things, while being 5 minutes away for shops and restaurants. Riley was an kind and attentive host. Not one complaint this place!! Stay here, you will be happy that you did."
5481,81,Such a special and unique place to stay. It felt like we were in the forest but it was centrally located to be able to explore the area around Durham and RTP. Perfect way to stay cool in the summer and enjoy some wine or coffee without all the bugs!
5482,81,"What a perfect place to stay! Riley and Gaby were thoughtful hosts; I appreciated their detailed and timely communication, both before and during my visit. The tiny home was such a peaceful location for a getaway—I loved sitting on the porch and found several greenways nearby—and yet still close to downtown Durham. I wish I could have stayed longer!"
5483,81,"Riley was a phenomenal host! The tiny home was perfectly clean, accurately described, and has plenty of amenities. We only stayed a short while, but the stay was great!"
5484,81,This place is AMAZING! Couldn’t have asked for a better weekend getaway!
5485,81,"Quick to respond, beautiful home."
5486,81,Fun little place for a weekend adventure. Great place. Great hosts. I would definitely come back!! Lots of fun. Highly recommend
5487,81,"We stayed here for my partner's and my fifth wedding anniversary and enjoyed the experience very much! This little house is absolutely gorgeous, with lush greenery all around the outside and visible from every window inside. The screened in porch was lovely even during the hot NC summer afternoon. The house was clean and the hosts were very communicative and responsive to our questions. Will definitely be booking this one again!"
5488,81,"My husband and I had a fantastic stay, this is a great location for a peaceful getaway with access to Durham’s local dives!"
5489,81,"This place was so perfect for our weekend get away in Durham. We went for a concert in Cary, NC which was only a 25 minute drive to the venue. We spent the day in Durham, shopping, hiking, pottery classes and Riley's place was the perfect spot for all of it. We would recommend staying here as he was wonderful and that whole place was modern, clean, well stocked and absolutely beautiful! Thank you Riley for sharing your Tiny House!"
5490,81,Was a great place - highly recommend!
5491,81,Fantastic home. Looks better in person then the pictures!
5492,81,Super clean and relaxing getaway spot!
5493,81,We had a blast. Loved the location. Everything was so clean and cute!
5494,81,"Beautiful home in a beautiful area. Everything was very clean. The forest surrounding makes it feel like a getaway but restaurants, downtown and Duke West campus are all close by as well. There were extra amenities I was not expecting but needed, such as an umbrella. The hosts are very thoughtful in how everything is set up and instructions were very clear. I hope this space will be available every time I travel back and I wish I had planned to stay longer."
5495,81,This place is great. Close to restaurants and anything you’d could need. Nice spot. Quiet and relaxing. Everything you’d need for cooking on a stove top.
5496,81,What a great host and thoughtfully designed cabin. Many amenities provided. Easy check in/out. Wish we could have stayed longer!
5497,81,"Riley’s place was wonderful! My husband stayed there for a weekend getaway, and he was impressed with the design, comfort, and the pour over coffee. ☺️ He loved the proximity to activities, and the remote feel of the home- very peaceful and relaxing."
5498,81,"Riley’s place is beautiful and he provides great recommendations and tips on places to check out.

The place is well crafted and designed. The amenities are just right and the space is very functional for a couple visiting town!"
5499,81,"Stayed one night as a waypoint on a road trip, and wish we had stayed longer! Very comfortable and quiet setting. Loved the well-stocked kitchen in particular, although no oven."
5500,81,"Seriously the most adorable tiny house!! Wish we didn’t have to leave. Perfect little getaway spot - comfy, close to everything, and the owner had great local suggestions."
5501,81,"Riley's ""tiny"" house is a sanctuary in the woods, and yet it's very close to everything Durham has to offer. We loved everything about it."
5502,81,"This Airbnb was so lovely! We LOVED the design and interiors, it felt so modern and luxurious! It's not really a tiny home, more like a little cabin. Everything was wonderful, and the hosts left us little gifts like chocolates. The bathroom and kitchen was well stocked, and coffee was delicious (whole bean w/ grinder & french press). The bed was super comfortable. Parking was easy as well - it's right next to the house. The screened-in porch was divine and so fun to sit outside during the spring evenings. We really enjoyed our time in such a lovely, well-designed space."
5503,81,So romantic here!
5504,81,Awesome stay! Loved every moment of it! Great getaway in the woods.
5505,81,It was awesome…everything was very nice..great place to go if you just wanna detach…the plants were everything…I even brought one of my own plants along for the ride so she could meet her distant cousins😊….it was a vibe….Definitely will go back…. It was giving what it was supposed to give 🌙💫☀️
5506,81,"One of the coolest AirBnBs we have stayed in. Gaby & Riley were very responsive, the place was spotless and they went above and beyond with accommodations. We would recommend to anyone who is visiting the Durham/Raleigh area."
5507,81,"It was perfect and beautiful in every way! The hosts accommodated us having a last minute booking and allowed us to check in early which was so nice!! We loved how well stocked it was with all things you may forget and it was just decorated so cute! The birds and greenery were so relaxing and it was nice to be tucked away, yet so close to so many stores, restaurants, and the city! The recommendations we were given for food were also wonderful. Can't wait to visit here again one day! I recommend this place times a million. And the fact the hosts were so accommodating and kind made the experience that much better. Thank you!"
5508,81,"The house was perfect for a relaxing staycation! Loved all the cosmetic choices, little touches, having all the basics in the kitchen (plus extra goodies), the soft lighting, the layout, the porch swing. Created a great ambiance for self care and unwinding. I even requested a late checkout because I didn’t want to leave! Would definitely book again :)"
5509,81,Wonderful place and location! Would recommend to anyone as a cool place to stay :)
5510,81,"An enjoyable, adorable place to stay. Quiet, peaceful, lovely,"
5511,81,"The place is just darling!
Don’t even hesitate to book.

It says tiny but felt very spacious yet so cozy. Everything you need is provided with some special touches that the host included.

Gabby and Riley responded quickly and were very accommodating to request!

I would definitely book again if in the area,"
5512,81,"10/10 would recommend! Not too tiny and such a fun, peaceful stay."
5513,81,"Exactly as described! Style and decor is amazing, wonderful extras. I will definitely book again next time I am in town."
5514,82,"This was the perfect little get away! The place was so well done and cozy. The weather was awful the entire weekend so we weren’t able to enjoy the outdoor space, which was a bummer because it was also incredibly well done, but we’d love to stay again! Hosts were very friendly and welcoming; tons of nice touches to the place! Totally recommend for a couples get away."
5515,82,"This place did not disappoint! Mike and Reggie were on top of it, very communicative, and made us feel special upon checkin with wine and chocolate. This place is SMALL so if you are a 17-bag-beauty-queen, this isn’t your place. Pack light and you will enjoy! Close to Target and several great restaurants. Absolutely would stay again!"
5516,82,I had a great time. Just spending time here was amazing. Reggie was a great host and the location is just as cool as it looks!
5517,82,Great space! Shower was a finicky.
5518,82,"Reggie’s place was very nice. It was actually a lot nicer than the pictures posted. It’s a cute place for a weekend getaway. We spent the first evening in the hot tub which is conveniently located just right outside the house. Reggie set the outside up with a hammock, a fireplace, a tree swing and even a mini golf course. The inside of the house was super cozy and perfect for two people. The bed was set up for us, but it could have been made into a couch if we wanted. Reggie left us a bottle of wine which a very sweet gesture. He also left us recommendations for restaurants in the area. Overall the stay was wonderful, a great way and place to spend our anniversary!"
5519,82,An amazing experience. Lots to do at the property. Everything was in pristine condition.
5520,82,Perfect little getaway from home. Very dog friendly. In a quiet neighborhood. A great experience.
5521,82,Perfect little getaway. Close to everything.
5522,82,Very cute place and perfect for a weekend getaway
5523,82,Enjoyed the jacuzzi and time alone with my husband.
5524,82,Very responsive host and very clean place! We had a great weekend! Thank you again!
5525,82,Fun location!
5526,82,Good location!
5527,82,Always wanted to stay in a storage unit and this didn’t disappoint! So very cool. Very clean. Reggie and Teka were great hosts. They left little chocolate and wine which was a special touch! The place was very clean and felt brand new! Loved it and would recommend!!! Will be back!
5528,82,We had a wonderful stay! This Airbnb is perfectly located in a quiet neighborhood but with plenty of things to do around us. It was perfect for our little anniversary trip! Would definitely highly recommend and stay again.
5529,82,The tiny house was clean and well decorated. It was exactly what we expected and in a great location.
5530,82,Nice cute place! Easy checking in! Very thoughtful touches
5531,82,Stayed with a friend and it was perfect! House was adorable and equipped with everything we needed. They even left us a few treats! The hot tub was amazing and it was very peaceful sitting outside. Convenient location and would stay again!
5532,82,Such a fun place to stay! Conveniently located to lots of great places. Would stay again!
5533,82,"Great place, only thing is I’m 6’3”, my girlfriend is 5’11”. The bed was a tad too small. Otherwise a wonderful place!"
5534,82,A wonderful romantic weekend. Loved the hosts attention to detail and quick communication. Definitely planning to return next year.
5535,82,Reggie was great! He was extremely communicative. I highly recommend this place! We got a special message written for us and felt very welcome! The place was also spotless! The hot tub was awesome too :)
5536,82,Cute little tiny home. Hot tub was very nice. Exactly as pictured/described! Super responsive host.
5537,82,"Stayed a weekend for as a gift for my husband's birthday. Reggie had a birthday message written when we arrived, complimentary wine, water, coffee and a sweet treat. If I had a question- Reggie answered iy immediately!

The home was beautifully decorated, smelled great and was very clean. Close to shops, restaurants and Concord Mills.

If you want something cute, romantic and outside the box- this is the perfect place."
5538,82,"Great place, we enjoyed our stay. It was cozy and felt like home. Very clean and easy to find."
5539,82,My wife and I stayed with our two small dogs. Great place and would recommend staying here in the future. Reggie was very responsive and helpful. The home was close to restaurants. Thank you
5540,82,This place is very cute !!! Great getaway. Hot tub was also a nice touch
5541,82,"This was by far the most thoughtful and inviting short-term rental I have ever stayed at! The home itself was better than the pictures! There were positive sayings and decor that made you feel peaceful and at home the moment you walked in. There was even a personalised welcome message waiting for me with a special treat! How thoughtful! There was attention to detail inside and out. There was all the ammenities of a full kitchen, such as cooktop, microwave, coffee maker, waffle maker, and blender, along with pots, pans, and utensils. They had both regular and throw-away cups and plates so you can enjoy the bbq grill outside by the picnic table if you chose to. They even had charcoal and lighter fluid waiting with bbq utensils! They also had easy-light logs stacked in the bonfire pit alongside the hammock, swing, put-put, horseshoe pit, and hot tub! The yard was huge and beautiful! And the horses behind the property came to visit quite often. Even my dog had the best time!"
5542,82,The accuracy of the listing as far as pictures versus in person was great. The communication was awesome. Definitely a cozy getaway. 10 out of 10 would recommend.
5543,82,"This was by far the best Airbnb my girlfriend & I have stayed at out of all the other places we’ve stayed at before. The hot tub was definitely the best part about this place. Everything was clean, very comfortable, and well designed. This place is near so many restaurants & a nice mall is well. This is absolutely PERFECT for any couples looking for a nice vacation to plan tons of things. The hosts were very nice & welcoming as well. Couldn’t ask for anything more, thank you so much guys! I hope to come back one day. 😊"
5544,82,Loved this place! Very cute and near by lots of stores & restaurants. Enjoyed the hammock and if it hadn't rained would have enjoyed the fire pit! Would stay again.
5545,82,"What a GEM near Charlotte and the Concord area. Relax in a hammock, eat on the roof deck, have a drink in the hot tub or just chill in the cozy ship-container space. We stayed for two nights and were able to rewind from a conference every day. Great location for food or a little shopping."
5546,82,Great stay. Awesome place and just perfect for what we needed. Super close to race track and and other items in the area. Checked every box and would stay again!
5547,82,Was a really great experience. Check in was easy. Dog friendly. We only stayed a night but would def come back :)
5548,82,"We really loved our stay at this unique property - a couple and their standard poodle. The property is located in a quiet neighborhood, but it’s less than 5 minutes away from major shopping areas.

Our favorite amenities were the hot tub, hammock, and spacious yard for our dog to run around.

The space is enough room to store a large crate and a small suitcase, but I wouldn’t recommend anything more than that.

We would absolutely stay again!"
5549,82,"This unique space was done very well; Reggie thought of everything to outfit the place! Easy to find and check in, and we appreciated the notes on how to access the Murphy bed."
5550,82,We really enjoyed our stay here! Great “tiny house” experience with a lot of features. Reggie is a great host and very communicative!!
5551,82,"Really cost tiny container home. Nice bathroom and comfy Murphy bed. The outdoor spaces are the best. Hot tub, hammock, upper deck and sweet fire pit area made for a very fun stay. Great spot for a couple."
5552,82,Absolutely wonderful. Hot tub was amazing and just what we needed to wind down and relax after a fun day out and about. Host left a wonderful note and some candy and wine behind for us. It was lovely.
5553,82,"Perfect location, great communication and easy to locate. Reggie was very helpful with my concerns on traveling due to weather. And very quick to get back to me."
5554,82,"Unique and great little place! Reggie was a great host, quick to respond to any question."
5555,82,"This place was amazing. It is literally the perfect getaway without really getting away. The bed was extremely comfortable and the a/c was soo easy to use so even though the outside setup was perfect it was hard to leave the bed. The kitchen had everything you could possibly need even a blender. They are the greatest host I’ve ever had. They left us everything we needed for the fire pit and the grill. They also set up the hot tub the before I checked in so it would be ready for me. They answered me so fast when I had trouble with the stove and was so patient and understanding (I just didn’t read the instructions well enough though😂). The greatest part of it all was my dog was more than welcome and he had the best time of his life running around the huge land and laying the sun. Our favorite thing was waking up and sitting on the hammock (him laying near the hammock) and just watching the horses across the way just be majestic.
10/10 would recommend and can’t wait to come back."
5556,82,"This is a cute, thoughtfully designed space with great outdoor areas. The check-in/check-out process was smooth and Reggie was very communicative."
5557,82,Such a great Airbnb! Would 10/10 recommend. Perfect distance from Charlotte to experience the city but also far enough away to feel like you’re in nature. Loved it!
5558,82,"Reggie and Teka's place was truly our favorite place we have ever stayed at. They were so thoughtful and kind with the notes, the sheet with nearby places and more, the bug spray on the top deck and so many other things. Way too many to list. The property was so nice and relaxing, my wife and I had something to do in Charlotte and found this place kind of last minute, but this will now be a regular weekend getaway spot for us. We can't wait to return during winter and use the hot tub. The neighborhood felt safe and quiet. Reggie would respond within minutes and was always helpful. Them as hosts are what I feel airbnb is supposed to be. Truly a perfect stay."
5559,83,"Great, family-friendly home in a beautiful location. There were plenty of games and books, as well as a nice list of things to do in the area. We enjoyed the Biltmore, hiking Hickory Nut Falls, and the Moogseum / Moog factory tour. This place is about 15-20 minutes from Asheville but worth the drive - we were happy for the peace and quiet. I saw a momma bear and three cubs the first day, so take the precautions seriously… bears are peacefully cohabitating with humans in this area of NC!"
5560,83,A beautiful home in a great location - hope to visit again in the future!
5561,83,"I booked this cute cabin as a surprise gift my two sisters and I game for ur mom. It was a girls only getaway after not being together for a year and this was a favorite of the places I’ve stayed! It was a cold weekend but the activities immediately available to inside the Little Red Casa and directly outside (fire pit and swing) kept us so cozy during our memory making time
together. We never even left the property! This was the first place we’ve been where when a question was asked, the house seemed to answer and always with a yes. Apron? Yes. Great for adults, but could I bring my kids? Yes (and I absolutely want to return and do this!). What about my dog? Yes! Puzzles? Yes! Movies? Yes! Watching sheep while drinking your morning coffee? Yes! We had high hopes and were not let down. This still felt like an unexpected gem and beyond worth the memories we made. We can’t wait to return next year <33"
5562,83,This is wonderful to read and what we always hope guests experience at The Little Red Casa. We would love to have you back any time!
5563,83,We had a great time! Throughly enjoyed The Little Red Casa! We hope to be back again.
5564,83,Such a perfect cozy mountain cabin!
5565,83,"Jen’s Little Red Casa was amazing all around. Very cozy, great views, and was just a short drive to Asheville. Jen was a fantastic host, always responsive and very nice. Can’t wait to visit again!"
5566,83,"We stayed at The Little Red Casa for my daughter's wedding weekend.
The home was perfect! Just what we needed and just as described. Jenn was friendly and prompt with any questions I had prior to our arrival. My only wish was that we had more time to enjoy all that this lovely home and host offered!
Thank you so much!!!!"
5567,83,"WOW! Little Red Casa was beyond our expectations! It’s so charming we didn’t want to leave. In fact, we stayed an extra day. I’ve stayed in a lot of Airbnb’s but this one is exceptional. Convenient location. The view is outstanding. Quiet and private. The house is so adorable as the yard. Comfy bed too! Easy access to anywhere you desire. Jen is an amazing hostess. I asked many questions and she responded straight away. Enjoy your stay. It’s worth every penny. Thanks Jen!"
5568,83,"We had a wonderful stay at the Little Red Casa. Great views around the property! It was a nice getaway but also close to town for things to do. The house was very clean and quaint. The owners were responsive, flexible and great to work with! We’ll definitely stay here again."
5569,83,Home was very nice and private. However hosts expect visitors to do almost all the cleaning plus charge a high cleaning fee which poses two issues. Not only do you have to plan to practically clean the entire house before you leave but also have to rely on the visitors before you to leave everything clean instead of knowing that someone actually took the time to clean everything properly. Lots of dirty pots and pans in the cabinets when we arrived. Also the swing in the back yard is attached to a large and obviously dead tree limb. Could be very dangerous.
5570,83,"Oh my.
I had to take a couple of deep breaths before responding to this review. Mike and I have been welcoming guests for 12 years. If you read our other reviews you will see how seriously we take hosting.
I have never had anyone suggest that we have guests ""practically clean the entire house"" or that other guests needs to rely on previous guests to provide cleaning - both statements are not true. We pay to have The Little Red Casa professionally cleaned after each guest. We actually pay our cleaner more than the modest $55 fee that we collect.
We always ask our guests to let us know if anything is not ok. This review was the first we heard from Andrew. He didn't respond to our check-in message nor did he respond to our message thanking him for his stay and wishing him well.
As to the swing, it is attached to a deciduous tree limb that shows no signs of life in winter. Although I appreciate Andrew trying to look out for others, the tree is healthy and the swing is safe.
Please feel free to message us if you have any questions."
5571,83,"Beautiful and quiet - The little red casa is a wonderful home, well equipped and close to everything!"
5572,83,Very clean!! Great quiet location and close drive to Asheville.
5573,83,"This was our third time to choose The Little Red Casa for a visit to the Asheville area. Again, it did not disappoint. We love it there and feel right at home. The house has everything we need and is a peaceful spot to spend our time, when we're not out enjoying all the things there are to do in Asheville. Jennifer has created a very special experience for her guests and we can't wait to come back some day."
5574,83,"The red Casita was a very relaxing, tranquil, clean and quiet. It had everything we needed for myself, my husband and 16 month old son. We were able to set up my sons pack and play in the secondary bedroom with no issue and he slept amazingly. The kitchen has everything you need and is perfectly clean. It was about a 20 minute drive from the entrance to the Biltmore Estate. I would absolutely stay there again."
5575,83,"We had a wonderful stay at the red casa, location is perfect and central to Asheville. The property is gorgeous as well and very cozy for a family getaway."
5576,83,Great house and location. Loved our stay.
5577,83,We loved our stay at the Red Casa! The house had everything we needed and was spotless. The property and surrounding mountains in October were stunning. We will be back for sure!
5578,83,"This is the second property of Jen’s that I have stayed in……Great place!……really loved the privacy and quiet. Jen’s places have great details and little touches of design that make you feel like you are in a high-end place but with a great value price!! She is VERY responsive to any issues you may have….AND she is a very nice person (having met her during a stay last summer). When I am visiting the Asheville area, I ALWAYS check out Jen’s properties first to see if they are available! She is the best value in the area!"
5579,83,"Wonderful experience at this house. Beautiful peaceful spot on a hilltop overlooking a field (and some sheep!) with great mountain views, especially in the fall time. Very clean and very well kept and updated. Has everything you need, and only about a 15-20 min drive to downtown Asheville. Would most definitely stay here again!"
5580,83,We would love to have you!
5581,83,Amazing time staying at The Little Red Casa for our mountain retreat! Close proximity to all of our desired Fall activities and so much more to explore! Exited to return again soon!
5582,83,We've been staying at the Little Red Casa for years. Already planning our next trip back.
5583,83,had a wonderful time and beautiful place!
5584,83,"Everything about the house turned out to be perfect, the location, house itself and the yard. It was unique and the right size for our family of four. It was better than pictures. We’re really looking forward to returning, it was hard to pack up and leave."
5585,83,"My wife and I really enjoyed this place when celebrating our 1st year anniversary. It was a very clean and private home, with a beautiful piece of land with a gorgeous view. They had plenty of things to do around the house, but also not a far commute from Asheville. We highly recommend you stay here if you get the chance it's a great place to disconnect and enjoy quality time with one another. Will be returning for another stay! Thanks✌🏼"
5586,83,"We loved our stay at the little red casa. We had more than we needed, and wished we had more time to chill at our temporary home as we visited dear friends in Asheville. We won’t hesitate to return when we are in the area. Our kids loved it!!!"
5587,83,"You won’t ever want to stay anywhere else to visit Asheville! This very comfortable and updated house has everything you could want and more, at a very reasonable price."
5588,83,"Awe, love this! Thanks Ronald, and thank you for being such a great guest."
5589,83,"We cannot say enough about Jennifer's place in Swannanoa. It was perfect - the location, the house, the amenities, the privacy and serenity, the scenery - we saw a mama bear and three cubs; sheep in the pasture and a deer. The bears made us even more cautious with our dog outside, of course, but it was extremely exciting and a first for us. I only wish we could've stayed longer. We will be back again!"
5590,83,So great to hear and we would love to have you back any time! Thanks for being a great guest!
5591,83,"This was easily one of the most, if not the most, relaxing and peaceful stays we've had, all thanks to our hosts and this amazing property. Both our young sons were asking to come back before even getting out of the driveway. This home allowed for us to enjoy staying in or going out. We would love the chance to come back again."
5592,83,This is so great to read. We particularly love when youngsters fall in love with our place. Come back any time!
5593,83,The Little Red Casa was a perfect set up for our family of four - especially making our two little people comfortable!
5594,83,"We had a wonderful stay at Jennifer’s charming cabin and if ever back in the area would definitely consider returning! My family really appreciated the comfortable space, large well equipped kitchen and all the helpful and thoughtful extra touches (candles, games/books firewood/starter, fairy lights at fire pit, info book, detergent, bear spray/horn, walking sticks, etc…).

We did experience the excitement of briefly seeing a black bear our first morning in the yard but it caught a glimpse of us trying to take a picture through the window and quickly ran away.

We’d like to return again and hopefully the weather will be better to allow more time to enjoy the wonderful outside deck, yard & try out the croquet set (unfortunately pretty rainy all week) but are thankful we were able to experience one night at the great fire pit watching the fireflies and stars!"
5595,83,Thanks for being a great guest! We would be happy to have you back some time in the future.
5596,83,"Loved our stay! The little red casa was perfect for our family. It was an easy drive to hiking, downtown Asheville and the Biltmore. It was really important that we found a “toddler friendly” place to stay and we couldn’t have found better! There were many books to keep her entertained, she was able to safely run around outside and she loved the tree swing. We loved being surrounded by the mountains and all the beauty that comes with that. Checking in and out was a breeze. Jen was a fantastic host. Would highly recommend to other small families!"
5597,83,Love the visual of a toddler running around the Little Red Casa and swinging on the swing. Thanks for being great guests!
5598,83,One of the nicest places for a relaxing get away.
5599,83,What a wonderful spot!! Jen and Mike were excellent hosts for us and the cabin was so tranquil. After a week we really didn't want to leave.
5600,83,Love this! Time well spent when you aren't ready to go home. Come back any time :)
5601,83,Awesome cottage. We absolutely loved staying there. It was a country setting close to everything we were going to in Asheville. Jennifer has the perfect cottage getaway.
5602,83,"A real gem- very clean, incredible kitchen and well stocked pantry, beautiful backyard. Sitting outside under the stars making s’mores around the fire was a dream. We were so sad we couldn’t stay longer.
Note- no shampoo/conditioner/body wash provided, so come prepared (this is advertised).
*We did have a bear behind the shed on our first evening*, so we kept our ears open anytime we were outside. There is a bear horn and spray provided in the pantry."
5603,83,"Wonderful! We love hearing about these experiences. S'mores and stargazing is the best! For any future guests that might be reading, Katarina is right, we don't provide shampoo/conditioner (it's not listed as an amenity) however we do provide bar soap for bathing."
5604,83,"The best place we’ve ever stayed. It had everything! It was so cozy and the views were stunning. Perfect for a family with young children. 20ish minutes from most things whether you wanted to go into the city, drive the Parkway, go to Biltmore, horseback ride, brewery, hike or relax! Jennifer was amazing with recommendations and every place/thing we did was spot on. The kids were so sad to leave and asked if we could come back to the little red casa!"
5605,83,My favorite is when kids are in love with their experience! Thanks for sharing :)
5606,83,"We'll definitely stay again! Very picturesque landscape around the house, and great experience overall."
5607,83,"A perfect get-away spot! A short drive from Asheville, tucked away in the country. The home has a great set up and many extras that were great!"
5608,83,This little casa was one of the best places we’ve stayed at on Airbnb! It has everything you need! The kitchen is lovely with the huge island and fully stocked. We would totally stay here again. Communication was clear and there were tons of amenities that made it feel like home!
5609,83,We continue to return to this vacation spot. Jennifer is a great host and the house is amazing. Tremendously relaxing and beautiful.
5610,83,"Jen's Little Red Casa was a wonderful place to stay if you're looking for peace and quiet in the mountains while still having easy access to area hiking and all that Asheville has to offer. The house and property is exactly as expected, and was extremely clean when we arrived. The kitchen is even larger than we expected based on the photos, which was nice for cooking and laying out meals. You're only about 15-20 minutes into Asheville, and only 5-10 minutes from Swannanoa and Black Mountain. We loved being able to let our dog run around the yard while we enjoyed sitting on the deck or around the firepit. We'll definitely look to stay here again on a future trip."
5611,83,Thanks for taking the time to write such a lovely review and being such great guests. We would love to have you back for return visits!
5612,83,What a wonderful stay! Beautiful inside and out. Everything our family with 5 year olds needed. Perfect distance to hikes and restaurants.
5613,83,"Fantastic to hear, come back any time!"
5614,83,We’ve been coming here since 2014. It’s perfection. Can’t wait until we can come back.
5615,83,"This location is perfect for a getaway! So close to Asheville, but secluded enough to feel away from it all. Very clean and wonderfully stocked. We can’t wait to visit again."
5616,83,We be happy to have you back!
5617,83,absolutely the best Airbnb we have ever stayed at can’t wait to come back!!
5618,83,Thanks Taylor - come on back any time!
5619,83,This house was everything we needed! From the location to the amenities were everything we could have hoped for. Don't hesitate to book!
5620,83,"Awe, thanks Danielle!"
5621,83,"I have stayed at over 20 airbnb's in the North Georgia and North Carolina mountains and this one is by far one of the best! It has everything you could need for your trip - clean linens, a well stocked (and BIG) kitchen, super comfy couch and an absolutely beautiful view. Only a hot tub could make this place more perfect! I'll definitely be staying here again."
5622,83,Wonderful to hear and you are always welcome back!
5623,83,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay to celebrate our anniversary. The house was so comfortable and cozy. They thought of everything you could possibly need! Extreme attention to detail. Would definitely recommend.
5624,83,"We LOVED this house, and had such a fun time making memories here! It is in the perfect location in relation to being in the mountains and a quick drive to downtown. Also the natural light in the house is a 10/10.

It was perfect for our girls trip and hope to come back soon. :)"
5625,83,"Thanks Rachel, we would be happy to have you back any time!"
5626,83,This little Red casa was exactly what I was looking for and what my soul needed. Absolutely gorgeous home and conveniently located.
5627,83,You are welcome back any time Kiet! Thanks for being such a great guest.
5628,83,"What a wonderful stay at Little Red Casa! Communication with host Jennifer was excellent. The space is open, airy, and bright. There are plenty of cozy spots to sit and enjoy the wonderful selection of books, puzzles, and games. The guitar was a nice surprise! The calming, natural color schemes and whimsical decor are lovely. The kitchen is well-equipped with everything we could need, although we ate most of our meals out during our stay. The bedrooms had comfortable mattresses, soft sheets, plenty of pillows and lots of closet space.
The hosts have put a lot of thought and care into this house. Even my husband, who doesn’t usually notice such things, commented on how the owners had “thought of everything.”
Although the Casa is pet-friendly, I could find no evidence of pets having been there—it was spotless."
5629,83,This is all so wonderful to hear. Thanks for taking the time to write this thoughtful review. We hope to have you back sometime soon!
5630,83,"Jennifer is an A+ host and the little red casa is an excellent example of her hospitality. Family of 4 on vacation from central fla. it rained a bunch so we didn’t get to hike much but it was still a lovely time. Kitchen is well equipped, tons of movies and games, and a fire pit that we were able to enjoy one night before it rained.

We will return!


Friendly heads up! Many restaurants in Asheville are suffering from emergency COVID related closures, we recommend calling ahead as we had several false starts because google still says everything is open. There were still tons of amazing food options though! 12/28/21"
5631,83,"Awe, thanks David! We would love to have you all back. Next time - good weather and less Covid!"
5632,83,Lovely lovely little place to rest your head. Perfect kitchen to cook meals in. Spacious bathroom and bedrooms. Perfect views
5633,83,Thanks Aimee - we'd love to have you all come back any time!
5634,83,Amazing place to stay for a weekend getaway to Asheville. It was so convenient and close to downtown and Jennifer was an awesome host. Would 100% stay here again.
5635,83,We would 100% love to have you back : ). Thanks for being a great guest!
5636,83,Lovely location. Everything was clear in our communication with Jennifer and the place was clean. Great natural light and views. We hope to come back again!
5637,83,"Incredible location, house and surroundings. Everything was perfect. We have already scheduled future visits"
5638,83,"Thanks Shari, we are looking forward to having you back!"
5639,83,"Loved this place! Great location, very private feeling. The minute you step inside, you’ll feel right at home. So much beautiful natural light pouring inside! An amazing, open concept kitchen and fun living room to hangout. Highly recommend!"
5640,83,Absolutely top rated stay. Jennifer is so organized and communicative. The entire process was seamless and the house is incredible. We were able to go out at night and the stars were unbelievable. We also loved waking up to all the morning doves and wild turkeys foraging. The location is wonderful next to the farm. Unbelievably wonderful and relaxing stay. We already have future stays booked.
5641,83,"Loved the little red casa! Close to town, but far enough away from the traffic of downtown. Quaint and roomy enough for 4 adults. The view from the deck was outstanding.
The owner also provides dog bowls for your stay.
Thanks!"
5642,83,I am so glad you all could spend Thanksgiving together there!
5643,83,I loved this little gem it was so inviting and comfortable.
5644,83,"This place is hands down a gem!! The house is fully stocked with everything you possibly could need & extremely clean. The beds are very comfortable and the house temp was perfect. The WiFi was a huge plus since the cell service isn’t the best. The outside of the house is a huge plus, from the back porch to the fire pit and the mountains in the distance! The driving distance to Asheville is about 15-25 minutes depending on where you’re going, but we didn’t mind that at all. I was able to order instacart to deliver groceries which was a huge perk!!
Jennifer was always quick to responding to my messages, and even offered to deliver firewood - how sweet!
We’ll 100% be staying here again, and would highly recommend to my friends and family!!"
5645,83,Thanks for the sweet review Jessica! The biggest compliment for us is when guests return again(and again!) and tell their friends about us. We would love to have you back again.
5646,83,This was our third trip to little red casa and there’s a reason we keep coming back! It is so clean and cozy and a great launching pad for all the area has to offer.
5647,83,We loved our stay here! Great location and had everything we could have needed. Fire pit and dvd collection made for great nights. We will be back!
5648,83,"What a great house! Very quiet, super clean, beautiful views, nicely arranged floor plan….Jen thought of everything. We will definitely plan to return."
5649,83,"This was my family’s second time staying here. We thought it would be in folks best interests to be aware of some things when deciding to stay at The Little Red Casa.

Here’s our honest review:

Pros: The house has a wraparound deck and a great yard with a fire pit and swing. Indoor space is uncluttered and inviting. Overall, it’s a good, private location for a family with small children.

Cons: I swept nearly everyday during our stay and found a considerable amount of dog hair each time. My infant daughter was covered in dog hair from the rug in the living room. Dog hair was all over the couch as well. My wife attempted to use the vacuum but there was poor suction and the brush rollers were broken. Some of the spoons with wooden handles have sharp/rough edges, my son had complained about it hurting his mouth last year. We opted to buy plastic spoons this year when we saw they hadn’t been replaced. The towels are AWEFUL, they have a strong smell of mold/mildew. We had alerted the host last year of our concerns with the towels, excessive dog hair and spoons. It appears none of these issues were addressed.

Unfortunately, we will be finding a new place for next year’s trip."
5650,83,"This review makes me sad to read for two reasons. One, we always ask guests to reach out with any issues. Chris and his family stayed for a week and we never heard from him regarding his concerns. He did indeed make a comment about the spoons upon his previous checkout. The first and only people in 9 years of hosting to do so. We actually checked out all of them. Found two that might be considered to have rough edges, removed them for his stay and filed them to soften the edges. Second, as to the dog hair and the towels -one call or email to us would have easily remedied both of those concerns. We could have been there within an hour with a set of new towels and doubled down on any cleanliness issues. It is very unusual for us to hear this and we take it very seriously. I would like to point out we have a shelf of clean towels that should be in good shape and a shelf below that labeled ""clean but worn or stained towels"". Our intent is for guests to use them for dogs or messes if needed. Regardless, we appreciate the feedback and hope that future guests know to communicate with us if they have any concerns."
5651,83,Loved this place! It’s so cute and tucked away. Perfect for getting away from the madness that is wedding planning.
5652,83,"I’ve stayed in probably a dozen Airbnb’s over the years and this one is by far the cleanest and cutest of all! The location was great for exploring Asheville during the day and then having privacy and quiet at night. The country star filled sky was just majestic. I’ve been a huge fan of the owner’s interior design work for years and the little artistic details and clever renovations make the cabin a relaxing and super hip little retreat. Beds and furniture were comfy, kitchen fully appointed, awesome book and game collection. Coffee on the deck soaking in the mountain mist, remote rooster crowing, and cacophony of singing birds and insects was just what the doctor ordered. We will definitely be back!"
5653,83,Can't love this enough! Thanks Amy and come back any time!
5654,83,"It was such a great gem! We had an awesome time! The house was extremely clean, well outfitted and had everything we needed! We enjoyed the backyard and all the different outdoor seating options!"
5655,83,"Loved The Little Red Casa! Off the beaten trail and very private! Nice deck to enjoy the outdoors and have a coffee in the morning which we loved to do as well. Roomy inside with an open floor plan with many conveniences of home. The Casa is right next to a little farm that has sheep that graze right there and you can walk down the private drive to see them, as well as some other animals. We had a great time staying and taking in the quietness of the area. We would definitely go back if in the area again."
5656,83,My family of four had a great time at Jennifer's. We loved using the fire pit every night. It is nice and secluded but only a 10 minute drive to the Ingles or 15/20min into Black Mountain where there are awesome restaurants. We didn't spend a lot of time inside the cabin but it was comfy and has a good layout. Seemed stocked with all the essentials (but we didn't cook so I didn't pay too much attention to that).
5657,84,"Robin’s lake house is the loveliest quiet vacation spot for families. From the spacious, bright porch with activities to the well designed kitchen and baths we felt perfectly at home. The beds are extremely comfortable and the board and card games gave purpose to rainy lakeside evenings. We could easily spend a week or more here!"
5658,84,"Robin is a great host! She was very helpful on anything or any questions that you can have. The house was very comfortable, we didn't want to leave! It's very well described in the pictures. The neighborhood Is nice and quiet. We enjoyed the porch and the private pier on the lake. We will be booking again!"
5659,84,THIS SHORT WEEKEND TRIP BROUGHT BACK SO MANY MEMORIES. WE KNEW EXACTLY WHERE MAPLE WAS AND WHICH HOUSE IT WAS. WE STAYED ON MAPLE ON THE WATER FOR MANY YEARS UNTIL THE HOUSE WE RENTED WAS SOLD. OUR NEIGHBOR HAD HELPED BUILD THAT PARTICULAR HOUSE AND WE HATED HAVING TO FIND ANOTHER PLACE. THE ONLY THING I COULD SUGGEST IS HAVING A BOX OF TISSUES. OTHER THAN THAT THIS HOUSE HAD EVERYTHING! WE HOPE TO STAY THERE AGAIN IN THE FUTURE!
5660,84,This was my second stay here and there will be a third! A peaceful and quaint cottage within a shirt walk to the lake. A great porch for sitting and birdwatching!
5661,84,"Loved our stay. It was cold so we couldn’t hit the lake, but the home is super-clean. Everything we needed was there. Garbage bags, tons of towels, soap, shampoo. We’re definitely going back!"
5662,84,"This cottage is exactly as described and is a ""comfy cozy cottage""! Robin has done an impeccable job decorating this home. It is so clean and bright. the furniture is so comfortable. The screened in porch with amazing seating and dining bar table is a wonderful spot and in my opinion the highlight of the house. We loved our stay at White Lake, only wish it could have been longer!"
5663,84,This is a beautiful cottage in oneon NC's hidden gems. Host is super nice and the cottage has all you need. 5 stars all around !
5664,84,"Thank you, Thomas! It was a pleasure hosting you."
5665,84,"First, Robin was incredibly kind. Before our check-in, she was making recommendations for what is available during the off season to do. There was a nice note wishing my husband a Happy Birthday as well.

The home was amazing. The decor was beautiful (I’m a huge sucker for navy blue and gold accents). It was incredibly clean and well stocked. There was everything you could possibly need! A first aid kit, shampoo/conditioner, hair ties, cotton balls, feminine care, and plenty of fluffy towels. The beds were so comfortable. My husband and I prefer a firmer mattress and the king size bed was perfect. Not too hard though so don’t worry about that! My parents came with us and my mom could not get over how nice the was. We plan on coming back for the summer!"
5666,84,"My husband and I had a getaway weekend at Robin’s place and it was absolutely perfect! The cutest Airbnb that was so cozy and well thought out! It was clear that Robin put lots of love and thought into every detail- from the well stocked kitchen and bathroom, to the linens , to the cozy comforter and pillows on the bed , to the game collection! The place was very clean which is always a must for me when I stay at Airbnbs. Even though it was cold and rainy one of our days, we had the best time cozied up inside and were close enough to the lake to walk out on the pier when it stopped raining to see the beautiful sunset and rainbow over the water. I highly recommend this cozy lake cottage and we can’t wait to return!"
5667,85,Loved the dome and had a great experience. Beautiful view of the mountains. Everything was like the pictures. The hiking trail had a great view.
5668,85,Thank you Sherrie! We’re happy to hear you enjoyed the views as well as the beautiful mountain property!
5669,85,"Loved staying here. Incredible view. Check in was easy and seamless. The road in is indeed steep and would definitely require 4WD in ice/snow. However, my Nissan did just fine in rainy weather. Would love to stay here again!"
5670,85,Thank you Lily! We’re happy to hear you enjoyed the view! We loved hosting you and look forward to hosting you again!
5671,85,Had a great stay and the view was spectacular! Really enjoyed the sunset trail. The hot tub was..... how shall we say.....pristine. Thank you glamping collective. Thank you Matt. Thank you America
5672,85,Thank you for the great review! Love it! And thank you for being an excellent guest!
5673,85,This place is fantastic. Super clean. Beautiful views. Great host. Easy checkin/checkout. I'll will 100% be back for another stay. Everythingabout this place is stunning.
5674,85,Thank you Justin! You were a terrific Guest! We’re so happy that you enjoyed your stay on the mountain and hope that you come back soon!!
5675,85,We loved the Geo Domes. They offered a great view and were so quite despite all the other domes around us being full. Thank you for sharing them with us!
5676,85,Thank You so much Sarah! Please come back and try out a glass cabin next time! Thank You for being such a wonderful guest!
5677,85,Such a beautiful place! Very quiet and cozy. I feel very rested after staying here
5678,85,"Thank you Alyssa! We're very glad to hear that you had a quiet, restful stay with us on the mountain! We'd love to have you back!"
5679,85,Loved it !
5680,85,We loved having you! Come back to the mountain when its green and covered in wild flowers this summer!
5681,85,"Great place to try, the bed was very comfortable and the place had all the things we needed."
5682,85,"The place was amazing definitely worth the stay, the hot tub made the stay 10x more worth it, the view was great, the aesthetic of the interior was nice, but I would definitely recommend only using a AWD SUV/Off Road vehicle to get up the mountain."
5683,85,"Unique spot to have a quiet, romantic stay. Great views and amenities."
5684,85,Thank you Megan! We're so glad you enjoyed your stay with us!
5685,85,"We loved staying at Matt’s place. We stayed in the geo dome luxe. It was well equipped with things you need. We brought a laptop incase we wanted to watch some Netflix. View was beautiful when we opened the curtains next morning, but immediately closed them because the sun was so bright and hot lol. Shower was nice and hot, the bed was very comfortable. Matt responded anytime I sent a text. Unfortunately we had to leave the next day (we had arrived the next before) so we had hardly no time there. Our 3 year old possibly had appendicitis, so we had to rush home. We would book again, I do feel the price could be just a tad bit cheaper for such a small space. But overall it’s a great getaway and great hosts!"
5686,85,We are so sorry you had to leave early! And wishing your family health and happiness. Come back and stay with us again soon!
5687,85,"Loved this place!! The views were stunning and loved how you had privacy. Only complaint is that the road going into the location was gravel, and very steep. Would suggest an SUV or a truck. We had a car with 4wheel drive and thought that would be enough. Next time we will know better. Otherwise it was stunning."
5688,85,We loved hosting you and look forward to hosting you again in any season! Come back y'all!
5689,85,"Had an amazing stay, views were awesome! Everything was just as picture on the listing. We did the 1 mile hike up to the summit which offered 360 degree views, definitely suggest doing this short hike."
5690,85,Awe! Thank You Yasuko! Come back and stay with us soon! The summertime is sublime with the mountain the perfect shade of green and the wildflowers in full bloom!
5691,85,This was an amazing place! It was so beautiful and peaceful. All of the amenities were top notch. I look forward to visiting again.
5692,85,Blushing Julie! Come back this summer when the mountain is green and the wild flowers are in full bloom! Thank You for being wonderful guests!
5693,85,"Amazing stay!! Highly recommend! The view, the cleanliness, the communication, the modern touches, the comfortability, all top notch."
5694,85,Blushing! Thank You so much Alexander! Please come back and stay with us soon.
5695,85,Excellent will be back!!!
5696,85,You are the best! Come back soon!
5697,85,Awesome “glamping” experience. Beautiful dome beautifully decorated and great amenities so you won’t even need to leave. Was able to cook all meals with the neat countertop oven and 2 plate burner. No TV so just nature and your loved one! Perfect little paradise.
5698,85,Autumn we hope you will come back soon and join us on the mountain!
5699,85,"This was a gorgeous oasis away. We loved this dome so much. The views were spectacular and although there were other domes around, we did not encounter other people and did not have concerns of people being able to see inside our dome. There were awesome trails nearby. The hot tub was divine. We thoroughly enjoyed this place and will definitely be back (if we can secure a booking!). Thanks Matt for an amazing stay!"
5700,85,Anchana! Come back soon you hear?
5701,85,"Exactly what my golden retriever and I needed! A peaceful getaway, beautiful view of mountains from bed during sunrise and sunset, stars at night, and just 20 mins away from great food in Asheville"
5702,85,Thank You so much for being a wonderful guest! I hope you golden loved it too! Come back soon!
5703,85,"We had such a good time. The place is beautiful & has everything you need. We utilized the hot tub, fire & hiked a couple of the private trails. We took our golden retriever & she loved it too! It comes stocked with enough coffee pods, toiletries, towels for the hot tub, etc. we were pretty chilly the first night, but I didn’t realize extra blankets were stored under the bed!"
5704,85,Michaela! Please come back soon. We absolutely loved hosting you!
5705,85,"Beautiful mountainside views, love the trails on property and modern finishes. The common fire pit areas were unique and awesome. The only thing I would be aware of is the heating/cooling unit in the dome was unable to keep up with extreme weather, so it’s not entirely climate controlled - but, that is consistent with glamping! Overall great experience, would return."
5706,85,We loved hosting you Taylor- please come back in summer time when the mountain is green and the wild flowers are in bloom!
5707,85,"What a magical place!!! The perfect getaway for our anniversary trip. The views were just breathtaking. We also appreciated the personalized touches inside the dome that made our stay feel like a home away from home. I definitely would recommend booking a dome with the hot tub and fireplace, they were nice touches for the cold weather. In all, we were sad to leave and can’t wait to book for the fall!"
5708,85,You were a magical guest! Come back soon!
5709,85,So much fun and such amazing views! Only warning is when the Airbnb says 4wd or awd required… they mean it.
5710,85,Thank You Justin! Please come back again soon and stay with us!
5711,85,"Had the best time, will go back for sure!"
5712,85,"We loved our stay, it was a perfect little staycation. The hot tub was a little complicated for us to figure out but Matt was always responsive within minutes with any questions."
5713,85,"The domes are absolutely amazing. This was our first get away since our daughter was born 2 years ago. I highly recommend taking the trip with your spouse or significant other for time together to reconnect. We were snowed in the 2 days we stayed, we had more snow than expected and it was still perfect. Matt kept us updated on the road conditions and letting us know when a plow would be coming by to scrape the roads. The Mountain View’s with the snow was a sight to see for sure. Thank you Matt for an amazing place to stay."
5714,85,"This place was incredible. The views from the dome are stunning. Inside was clean, tidy & chic. The dome is stocked with everything you could possibly want including coffee, kitchenette, plenty of linens and basic toiletries. The hot tub was already running & ready for a soak. There was a snow storm that came through when I was there. The hosts were incredibly responsive—acting quick to clear the drive & sending updates. Despite not being able to make it down the mountain I was able to stay safe & cozy for the duration of the storm. I took a snowy hike with my pup up to the sunset lookout where there are 360 views of the mountains. It was a lovely stay & I can’t wait to go back."
5715,85,"Beautiful stay, great experience 😁"
5716,85,"I could not recommend this place enough! The location was so amazing, beautifully placed in the mountains surrounded by the views. Even the drive up to the domes is an experience. The community next to it has such great food with a friendly and comfortable atmosphere. The trails on the grounds is an impressive touch as well. The minimalist feel of the inside is so peaceful, yet there’s still so much detail inside. Of course the hot tub and fire pit were a plus. Staring up at the clear sky in the mountains while in a hot tub was a dream come true. I’m so thankful and honored to have stayed here, by far the most memorable place I’ve stayed in. Most DEFINITELY coming back."
5717,85,Great place
5718,85,Just as mentioned and beautiful location. A peaceful stay and highly recommend.
5719,85,We stayed at the domes with a hot tub and it was such an amazing experience. They truly designed such an amazing glamping experience you won't regret it!
5720,85,The Luxe Dome was absolutely perfect for our get away. The views were amazing. The place had everything we needed. Can’t wait to go back.
5721,85,First time booking an Airbnb and it was an absolute please. Best vacation
5722,85,This place has a beautiful view and everything you need for a great stay. Will definitely be back!
5723,85,"This was a stunning retreat! Private, quiet, and exactly what we were looking for. Advice for anyone coming in winter months- be sure to bring layers of clothing and an extra blanket or two. While the heat kept the dome at a moderate temperature when the curtains were drawn shut, it got very chilly with the curtains open (but ultimately still worth it for the view)! We were comfortable in our sweats and an extra blanket. Highly recommend this place!"
5724,85,Great Stay and great host! Look forward to visiting again.
5725,85,This was an incredible stay! The views are absolutely surreal and would 10/10 recommend this to anyone. Will definitely be back!
5726,85,"Great get-a-way to relax. Very unique accommodation, definitely have to try at least once in your life. Place was clean and had pretty much everything for your stay."
5727,85,"What an awesome, unique experience! I highly recommend it! Great hiking, wonderful views! Perfect place to relax, reset and rejuvenate your soul! My best advice is go ahead and book your dome! Don’t hesitate!"
5728,85,"This place is a hidden gem!
We had a wonderful vacation and really enjoyed our stay. The views were phenomenal and we enjoyed the ability to cook and use the hot tub. We loved the close proximity to great hiking trails. The communication was excellent and check in/out was easy. Truly an amazing place to relax and enjoy nature."
5729,85,Thanks Stacey! So glad you enjoyed the hiking trails and views! We've done our best to steward this beautiful setting and create space for guests to connect with each other and the nature around them! Hope to see you back again soon!
5730,85,"Staying at the dome for the weekend is a once-in-a-lifetime memory my boyfriend and I will share forever! The place was spotless with everything you need for a weekend getaway on the mountains. The morning views and the zen vibe was EVERYTHING we needed to celebrate another year together. The outdoor fire place and jacuzzi were extra touches that completed the moment. We couldn't wait to share our experience with family and friends, and we will DEFINITELY be back! Drive up and down the mountain is ~25-30 minutes."
5731,85,This place was absolutely amazing. Close to Asheville if you want more things to explore but definitely a place you could stay and not leave and have the best and most beautiful vacation.
5732,85,Thanks Austin for staying with us! So glad you had an amazing an time and enjoyed the proximity to Asheville yet the feeling you don't want to leave! That's exactly the guest experience we wanted to create!
5733,85,Simply spectacular - this stay is worth every penny.
5734,85,Simply put and we appreciate it! Thanks Amro for staying with us!
5735,85,It was so awesome. I definitely would rent it again. We did however have a few hiccups but it didn’t too much interfere with our stay in the lovely dome home; the water started acting up right after we got back from the amazing trail & the fridge had food left in it with a smell the first day but other than that it was lovely and those small things wouldn’t be why I wouldn’t book again cause I most definitely will again in the summer.
5736,85,"Thanks Kierra for your review! We apologize for the couple hiccups and glad you had an amazing experience and look forward to welcoming you back this summer! Come summer there are endless wildflowers in bloom, it's a sight that has to be experienced!"
5737,85,"Absolutely magical! 100 out of 10 stars! Stunning views, beautiful amenities, every detail careful thought out, breathtaking hike. Simply a dream come true! Counting the days til our next visit!"
5738,85,Thanks Dusty for the 100 out of 10 stars! Your review is so kind and we're so thankful to help make your mountain dreams come true! We look forward to welcoming you back!
5739,85,"Incredible! Everything was well thought out and we had everything we needed. The private sunset hike was amazing. Hot tub and private fire pit were great additions to the dome. The views are unbeatable. Being up in the mountain with clear night skies, star gazing was really fun. Highly recommend this for a unique nature experience."
5740,85,So thankful you had a great experience Milan! Taking in the views from your private hot tub or fire table really can't be beat! Hope to welcome you back again soon!
5741,85,Great place! Phenomenal views! We really enjoyed our stay!
5742,85,Thanks Brittany!
5743,85,"This was one of the coolest places we've ever stayed. The mountain views were phenomenal and the dome was completely comfortable, very well stocked, and perfect for our anniversary trip to the mountains and Asheville area. I would highly recommend a hike up the Sunset Trail if you are able. There is quite an incline but it is completely worth it once you get to the top (and the hike down is much easier and faster!) The dome itself was beautiful and had everything we needed. We will definitely be back!"
5744,85,Happy Anniversary Megan and thanks for spending with us on the mountain! So glad you enjoyed the dome and were able to hike up the Sunset Summit Trail. Hard to beat a hike to a private mountaintop for sunset! We look forward to welcoming you back soon!
5745,85,"Loved staying in this dome! Very cozy and exactly as pictured. A little chilly when we arrived due to the heat not being turned on, but once it finally heated up, it was great!"
5746,85,What an amazing place! Will definitely be coming back!
5747,85,The best weekend getaway! I can’t say enough about how perfect the Luxe Dome was. So clean and had everything we needed for a great weekend. We can’t wait to come back!
5748,85,"The dome was exactly what we expected. Very clean, quite and the view is amazing. We plan on visiting next year with a group of friends."
5749,85,"We had the best time at the glamping collective! They have everything you can think of in the domes. There is a grocery store less than 15 minutes away, and it is really easy to get to hiking spots or downtown Asheville!"
5750,85,"We LOVED our stay at The Glamping Collective! We stayed in a luxe dome - the accommodations were as amazing as the views! The dome was well appointed and had everything we needed and more. We appreciated the toiletries, k-cups, and extra paper towels and tp. The bed and pillows were very comfortable, and the extra throw blanket was super soft and cozy. We loved the hot tub after our days hiking or sightseeing. Although there are multiple domes on the property, they positioned them in such a way that each window and hot tub still has privacy. The location is great, with a grocery store and fast food just down the road, and activities in Asheville about 30 minutes away. The road on the property was very steep. Others made it up in cars, but we were glad to have a 4WD SUV.

Overall, a very well thought out property with great amenities, and very comfortable accommodations. We will definitely be back!"
5751,85,"The stay was excellent!
The floors could have used a good vacuuming/mopping and we would have appreciated a few more towels (2 ppl, 2 nights of hikes, hot tub & showers and only 2 towels) - that's it, there's nothing else negative; it was a wonderful experience!! If you are a nature lover this is worth the splurge and it also benefits the owners heart passion, OneWorldHealth, what appears to be a very worthy cause!"
5752,85,"This was an experience of a life time. Thank you for creating a space that allows for amazing memories. It was perfect from top to bottom.

I highly recommend spending the money on the dome with hot tub and premium view."
5753,85,A perfect place to relax and reset. Secluded location while being close to downtown Asheville
5754,85,"Very cool place and the domes were impressive. We were able to cook just fine in the convection oven, now I want one for our basement. The hikes on the property were challenging and rewarding. The view was gorgeous."
5755,85,"Wonderful stay, with a very relaxing and clean site to unwind and relax.
Loved waking up to the sunrise over the mountains."
5756,85,Can’t say enough great things about this listing! Such a beautiful spot!
5757,85,Definitely recommend this we had an Amazing stay here the sunrise and sunsets are incredible!!
5758,85,The place is gorgeous and the views are unmatched. Best Airbnb experience so far. Would love to come back some time!
5759,85,"We loved our stay here. The domes are very comfortable with gorgeous views. Relaxing in the hot tub and taking in the sunset was my favorite part of the stay.

Matt is very responsive and accommodating. We’ll definitely stay here again."
5760,85,"My husband and I felt so blessed to have been able to stay there! The views were incredible!! Being able to wake up with the curtains open, seeing the sun rise over the mountains was absolutely breathtaking. It felt like a dream relaxing in the hot tub with the glow of the sunset and that breeze. Absolutely heavenly. We didn't have a care in the world. Thank you so much for creating such a place for us to make epic memories together."
5761,85,Excellent place to stay! Highly recommend!
5762,85,"This place is awesome, if you are looking for a place to relax, then this is it. Awesome views. Will definitely be coming back."
5763,85,Truly an amazing experience and host! Will definitely be back!
5764,85,A M A Z I N G ! ! ! Cannot wait to come back!!! FYI my GPS took me a bit past the entrance. Not their fault of course :) just a note for new visitors
5765,85,"Wonderful place I would definitely come back, the sheer beauty of nature surrounding the camp was breathtaking."
5766,85,Spectacular view and great stay overall. Loved the location. It is centralized to great shops and restaurants (Waynesville and Asheville were only about 25 mins away). Stayed four nights and highly enjoyed the hot tub and gas fire pit. We weren’t able to utilize all the amenities nor hike the sunset trail. We plan on staying again and making time for the communal fire pit and hikes on the campground.
5767,85,"This was our first time glamping and we have a great time. The view is amazing and being able to enjoy it relaxing at bed was even better and true vacation. I highly recommend this dome and glamping experience.
Watching stars at night was added bonus."
5768,85,"Stay here for a magical time! We enjoyed our stay so much! It was clean, the property & amenities are amazing, & the communication from the hosts were outstanding! Will definitely stay again!"
5769,85,"The domes are so beautiful! The location was clean, safe, and quiet. We loved being able to stargaze from bed and wake up to a gorgeous view. Matt and Judith were helpful, quick to respond, and very kind. We will definitely do it again!"
5770,85,"We loved our stay at the Glamping Collective. Everything was perfect, the dome was beautiful, and everything in it is perfectly functional. Communication with host and check-in process was fast and easy. Once you get there, you really feel like you are in a luxury hotel in the middle of the mountains. But the best part of it are the views from the dome. This particular dome was even better cause the view of the mountains is completely unobstructed, it has a larger balcony than others with a hot tub and a fire pit, plus more privacy since it is in the lowest front part of the camping site. Another plus is that the camping site is really close to Asheville (30 min drive) and many hiking sites, so it was easy to go explore during the day and then come to relax in the hot tub and enjoy the views from the dome in the sunset. It was the perfect celebration for my birthday weekend. I definitely recommend visiting the Glamping Collective."
5771,85,Our dome was great and had a gorgeous view. There are ample grills for outdoor cooking and the Summit Trail is a five star (though steep) hike.
5772,85,"Very unique experience! Matt was quick to respond to any questions we had. Everything was clean and well taken care of.

Be sure to make the hike to the top of the mountain for an amazing sunset. Well worth the walk!

Would absolutely stay here again!"
5773,87,"Sherry was very responsive, we felt quite privileged to be able to use her house with its amazing views while the seasons were changing. I highly recommend staying here if you need accommodation in the area."
5774,87,Our stay at Sherrie’s Home was a wonderful get away. Everything was as listed on Airbnb. The home was clean and all amenities you would need was available and very spacious. The view is fantastic. Great to star gaze at night it was-a delight to view the lights below at night Sherry was very quick to answer our phone call when we needed her assistance. Deff recommend.
5775,87,Great house
5776,87,Great cabin with great views. Sherry is an excellent host!
5777,87,"Great house, we’ve stayed multiple weeks for work and plan to stay again in the future."
5778,87,Awesome views
5779,87,Great place to stay with a wonderful view. Very relaxing and clean home
5780,87,Another beautiful stay at Sherry’s mountain getaway and it’s a personal favorite! Very cozy and serene :)
5781,87,"Lovely house, we had a wonderful stay, the view was breathe taking every morning. Very peaceful, everything went smoothly."
5782,87,Perfection
5783,87,The views were amazing!!
5784,87,This home is beautiful! The few is also breath taking! We loved staying here for a quick weekly getaway. I beautiful view that makes you feel like you’re way up in the mountains. The home was very clean and had everything we needed. The beds are very comfortable and clean! I loved the flat and fluffy pillow option. Would love to come here during spring/ summer to enjoy the porch and view more. I would recommend this to anyone wanting a night or weekend away.
5785,87,"Sherry’s place was perfect for our needs! We would have loved to stay longer. The night time view of cities lights and the moon were great as well! Kitchen was well stocked, best I’ve seen! Beds were comfortable and sheets soft. Perfect for our party of 4."
5786,87,The view was more beautiful than pictures could ever show. The place itself was lovely. My family and I stayed for a few nights and loved it. Highly recommend.
5787,87,"Definitely best place I had at all , best and wonderful view , all clan , answer all massages on time and pretty respectful, early check in, i just want to say thank you so much 😊"
5788,87,"If I could give this place more than 5 stars I would! The home is beautiful & cozy and the location is perfect. The house is tucked away so you feel like you’re lost in the mountains, but it’s only about 5 minutes to the highway so it offers much quicker access to the surrounding towns compared to other Airbnbs. Sherry recommended many places that would pique our interest and she was incredibly accommodating. I’m so pleased that we chose this lovely mountain home as our first Airbnb experience."
5789,87,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay! The view itself was amazing, and took my breath away. Sherry was very helpful and even recommended a few local places to visit. We loved the “home-y” feel of Valdese. We will definitely return!"
5790,87,"Sherry was a wonderful host. She was easy to communicate with before and during our stay. The house was clean, and just the perfect size for our family. And that veiw was amazing. We would definitely stay at the property again."
5791,87,Beautiful place with a fantastic view. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and will likely book again.
5792,87,The cabin was very clean and looks like it was recently remodeled. We enjoyed our stay and the location is great for making day trips to several of the sights in the area.
5793,87,"Absolutely adorable house with an amazing view. The house had anything we could have asked for, plus very convenient location for multiple cities and towns. 10/10 would stay again!"
5794,87,"Beautiful home. Everything is clean and in a perfect place. Kitchen was fully stocked with everything we needed. It was clean upon check-in. The deck is a beautiful space although we wished for a bit more solitude as the home sits within ear distance of I-40 but that's a personal preference. We loved the area, so much less crowded than Asheville but a short drive for our adventures to South Mountain, Grandfather Mountain, a day trip to Asheville and Morganton. We would stay here again."
5795,87,Everything was as described. View from cabin was beautiful. Cleanest unit we have ever rented. Would definitely rent again.
5796,87,We had a wonderful stay at the rustic retreat. The cabin was so clean and had everything we needed. Thank you for sharing your place with us!
5797,87,Absolutely an amazing stay. View was incredible. Recommend to anyone
5798,87,Sherry was very attentive and helpful. The home was clean and all the description were perfect. Would love to come back.
5799,87,"Sherry was quick to communicate and easy to work with. The kitchen was well stocked, and the view was great!"
5800,87,"Sheet had great communication regarding the stay. The cab is clean, well-equipped and nicely decorated. The deck offers a beautiful view!"
5801,87,"Quiet, comfortable house with a phenominal view. Waking up to that biew was the best prt af every day!"
5802,87,Calming visit and beautiful views. House was clean and well taken care of. Would highly recommend!
5803,87,Wasn’t the first time staying here and won’t be the last! The view alone is worth getting this place! Sherry is an awesome host
5804,87,Beautiful location. Very clean. Driveway is a little sketchy but nothing to really complain about. Great stay overall.
5805,87,"Amazing place, awesome views, great host. Plan to stay for at least 4-5 days to get the best out of this place."
5806,87,Nice view!
5807,87,"Home is in a great location, close to many areas."
5808,87,"Super clean, beautiful airbnb with breathtaking views. It was such a peaceful stay seeing the sky + the shape of the mountains change colors throughout the day and into the evening. Even the hot water/water pressure in the shower was heaven. Wifi is fast. The place is decorated so lovely. Sherry was an outstanding host. Very sweet and communicative. We wouldn't hesitate to stay at this airbnb again next time we're in town! Thank you, Sherry!"
5809,87,"Super great views, clean and neat layout. The upstairs attic bedroom is awesome for kids (who can climb easy ladders). The downstairs gave us privacy why the kids enjoyed their clubhouse.

If you come here for work you may not get much done. Because you’ll just sit on the balcony and relax!!"
5810,87,"Beautiful spot, cozy home, nice location between Hickory and Morganton, and awesome views

We hope to have the opportunity to visit again. Highly recommend"
5811,87,"Great little place up in the mountains. Close enough to everything we needed. Golfed, grilled, and watched baseball."
5812,87,Don’t let the word “rustic” throw you off! This is a modern and well-kept property! Sherry was an excellent host and checkin/checkout was easy peasy. We had such a great time on the porch watching the birds flying so close by and enjoying the beautiful view of thunderstorms from inside the house. We will definitely be back!
5813,87,"All of the reviews are true—this place is AMAZING!!! The photos do not do this stunning home justice. The views are unbelievable and we were lucky enough to see fireworks every night for the 4th of July. It was truly an incredible sight. The house itself is well-appointed, comfortable, and offers everything you need for a wonderful vacation in the mountains. It's perfect for couples, families, or just a getaway for two. Plus, it's in an ideal location close to I-40 and just 10-30 minutes or less to gas, food, hiking, waterfalls, and more. However, we found that we most enjoyed staying at the house and lounging on the deck overlooking the mountains. With a view like that, there's really no reason to leave! If you do venture out though, McGalliard Falls Park (10 min away) is a great place to go to see a lovely waterfall with a fun swimming area. South Mountains State Park (25-30 min away) is also a nice destination not far from the house with waterfalls, swimming, and plenty of hiking trails. Sherry was an excellent host—very informative, communicative, and quick to respond when we needed anything. Book this place NOW—I promise you won't regret it!!! We will DEFINITELY be back in the future!"
5814,87,Quiet place! Awesome view!!!
5815,87,"A peaceful, private stay~
Sherry was the perfect hostess, stayed in the background, yet completely available and she checked in on us va text to be sure we had what we e needed. We did. The kitchen was wonderfully stocked with equipment making the kitchen as “Down Home” as could be.
We had more room than we needed.

Downstairs was nice though we didn’t use it….a whole additional private space with bathroom. And it was so convenient to have the washer/dryer. I didn’t mention the loft because we didn’t go up but there are beds there too. Just as described!

I can’t say enough about the generous sized deck, table, chairs, etc. for spectacular views and with trees on the side, we had a refreshing breeze most of the time.
Thank you, Sherry, for creating such a welcoming place!"
5816,87,My boyfriend and I loved our stay here. The view and home was beautiful and spacious. As well as everything from check in and check out was easy and seamless.
5817,87,"Sherry’s mountain home 🏡 was an absolute pleasure to live, cook, lounge and sleep in. A large amount of the finishes are of great quality and the fit and finish in the kitchen and both restrooms was impeccable, the craftsmen touches are a work of art. The lower level bedroom is the best bedroom to sleep in if you enjoy a cool and dark bedroom (which I love). The home A/C works wonderful and the home was extremely comfortable during the the South’s high heat of summer. When it came to cooking and meal prepping, the kitchen is fully stocked and they have anything and everything one may need to create wonderful meals. Sherry was very clear and polite with all and any communication, and the home’s cleanliness has been by far the best I have experienced in all my airBnB journeys. Once again I will greatly encourage anyone to book Sherry’s Mountain home."
5818,87,Sherry was an excellent host and answered any questions we had. the house was very very clean and had everything we needed. An amazing view! We were very happy with our choice to stay here.
5819,87,"The cabin has stunning views. Sherry is very response, and the cabin is super clean. One bedroom is downstairs, and stairs a bit steep. Fine for our 13 year old. :)"
5820,87,This place was what we needed. Quiet and peaceful. The two floors was a great surprise. The pictures don’t do it justice.
5821,87,"The pictures of the mountain view do not do this place justice. It was incredibly beautiful! Nice long deck with rocking chairs for enjoying the scenery. Also a table and chairs seating 6 for outdoor dining. Parking was pretty easy for getting in and out. We had an Elaborate that could turn around easily. Our son had a midsized SUV that was a little more difficult to turn around but not impossible. Inside the host had decorated very nicely. Beds were very comfortable. Bath upstairs has a tub shower. Bath downstairs has a smallish shower. we're small people so it was fine but a large person would have difficulty in the downstairs shower. The heat and air is a minisplit both up and downstairs. Because of this, the bedroom doors had to be open at night so you don't get too hot or cold depending upon the time of year. The kitchen is small but very well equipped with cooking utensils and dishes. There was almost no sugar salt or pepper and no plastic wrap or tin foil so you should bring your own. there was plenty of coffee and tea. We enjoyed having 2 living rooms one up and one downstairs with their own TV. The location was also spot on because its very close to I40, about 5 minutes. And an easy quick drive to Valdese. Some of the easiest mountain roads to drive on to and from the house. The driveway to to the house is shared with 2 other homes but this was never a traffic issue for us. The home was extremely clean inside, one of the cleanest we've stayed in. The furniture outside had to be cleaned before we could use it. Cleaning supplies are provided. Sherry was easy to communicate with. We would definitely stay here again. Its perfect for 2 adult couples which is what our party was."
5822,87,"Very clean, cozy cabin. Everything was just perfect. Well deserved 5 stars!"
5823,87,"a truly wonderful Airbnb with an amazing view of the blue ridge mountains! Clean and tidy, Sherry’s home was lovely!"
5824,87,"There's a beautiful view all hours of the day! Great host and communication. Kitchen doesn't have a wide variety of seasonings, but it does have every utensil and cookware item you can think of.

I recommend traveling to Morganton to eat at The Town Tavern. They have riverside seating :)"
5825,87,"Wow! this place is Amazing!! The view from the balcony is incredible. Inside the house is very cozy, big and comfortable. The kitchen have everything you need. Good communications with the owner. Recommend 100%."
5826,87,"We loved our stay here! It feels like you’ve gotten the keys to a close friends house, and you have all you need to enjoy your weekend getaway. My cleaning standards are relatively high, and this stay impressed me with the amount of care that’s been put into maintaining the house. It’s charming, inviting, and overall well accommodating and we found everything we needed to have a great stay within the premises."
5827,87,"We loved our stay in Valdese at the Mineral Springs Mountain Retreat. The location was perfect...it was close to the interstate, and close to many dining options. The cabin was very clean and cozy. It overlooked the mountains and the town and the view was stunning. The hostess was a wonderful communicator and was very available to assist us with the booking process. We recommend Sherry and her quiet retreat."
5828,87,"I really enjoyed staying here for a long weekend. It is hard to find a place for a single person that is nice and is not overpriced but this was definitely an affordable stay. Sherry gave tons of suggestions before my stay and responded within minutes whenever I needed to get in contact with her. Her place is very clean and feels just like home. The bed is comfortable, there is everything you will need in the kitchen including coffee, and plenty of room if multiple people stayed. The view is incredible during the day and even at night. There is a lot of seating outside and there is also a small grill with charcoal provided. There are cabins/houses nearby, but there were no noise issues at all it was like they were not even there. You certainly cannot go wrong staying here! To note: I read some comments about the driveway being steep, but it is easily accessible with 2wd as I have a Camaro. The driveway is very narrow, and it is not easy to turn a vehicle around so keep that in mind. The upstairs TV does not have many options, but the downstairs TV has plenty of options including Hulu, Netflix, YouTube, etc."
5829,87,"Cute as a button, neat as a pin! This adorable home sits perched on the hillside with the most mesmerizing views. Two bedroom suites, one up, one down and a pair of twin beds in the loft gives plenty of sleeping space. There are two separate areas to relax, a cozy living room and kitchen/dining on the main floor and another living area downstairs, both with large TVs, downstairs with a fireplace. There's a washer/dryer downstairs too. A huge wrap-around porch is perfect for outdoor activities. Once you navigate the steep narrow driveway, the home is an ideal vacation retreat. Sherry was an awesome host!"
5830,87,Great place to stay. The view is amazing! The pictures don't do it justice! The location is very convenient. Awesome hiking trails at South Mountain State Park! Easy day trip to Asheville or Charlotte. Easy access to drive the blu ridge parkway. Grandfather mountain and Mt. Mitchell are both about an hour drive. Nice towns close by. We went to Hickory motor speedway for a race! JD's smokehouse and Old world baking company were great places to eat nearby. We would come back!
5831,87,The house and location was awesome! Highly recommend!
5832,87,"We really enjoyed ourselves definitely want to do this again we really enjoyed the mountains like the view was everything!! 🥰🥰🥰
Mom Star/I was surprised with this Trip from my two oldest 18 & 20 They blew me away with this first trip,To the owner Your cabin was an awesome experience I personally thank you!!"
5833,87,Beautiful place with beautiful scenery!!
5834,87,This place is so much better in person than it presents in pictures.
5835,87,"The best way to wake up and go to sleep; with this wonderful view! Sherry's place was so cozy for a mountain retreat with my fiance!
Sherry thinks of everything, between extra blankets in every room, extra toiletries in the showers, fully shocked kitchen of utensils and appliances, and a few games/ DVD. Just a note, the steps in the home are a bit narrow.
Overall, this place is a gem!"
5836,87,Wonderful retreat in the mountains! I loved this home and the location was perfect. It was quiet and very comfortable. Will definitely be back!
5837,87,"Beautiful location, great views and a comfortable, cosy cottage. Perfect for a quiet getaway."
5838,87,"Very nice, clean cabin with updated kitchen, furniture, and decor! The view is beautiful during the day and at night with all the lights in the distance. There is a constant hum from the traffic which is relaxing.
The cabin is close to town and the main highway. The driveway is steep and narrow but we did just fine with a 2WD.
There are neighbors nearby, so the only true privacy you have is on the back porch and inside the cabin.
I can't say enough good things about the host! She is friendly, helpful, flexible, and understanding. :)"
5839,87,"We had a wonderful time at Sherry's place! it's perfectly decorated, clean and comfortable. 10 minutes from downtown Valdese with shops & restaurants. Hope to stay there again!"
5840,87,This was a beautiful space with amazing views and everything you needed to have a pleasant stay. We enjoyed traveling to South mountain state park and also eating at Two Brothers pizza in Valdese
5841,87,"Amazing cabin, awesome view!! Super clean, great location. Sherry is a great host and the communication was fantastic. I recommend this property 💯!! You’re not going to regret it. We enjoy every part or this beautiful place."
5842,87,"From the moment we got there we were in awe. The pictures just don't do this place justice. The views are spectacular, insane, awesome, wonderful, amazing (you get the idea). The house has everything you need for a quiet, peaceful getaway. Very clean, and well appointed. We wish we could have spent more time there. We will be back for sure."
5843,87,The view was beyond beautiful and the house was very clean and lovely. My friends and I enjoyed every moment of our stay and left feeling renewed and at peace.
5844,87,Loved the stay!!
5845,87,"From the moment we pulled up to the airbnb we were in love! The key was easy to find and host sent code well ahead of our arrival. The house was immaculately clean when we got there and was even decorated for Christmas. The porch has a spectacular view of the mountains and was where we spent a lot of our stay during the unseasonably warm December visit. So many different types of birds to watch!
The kitchen is well stocked, there's mixing bowls, measuring cups, measuring spoons. They even had a crockpot, griddle, and electric skillet and that's on top of the beautiful electric stove. We forgot flour and almost ruined breakfast but we were happy to find there was already some stocked in the kitchen along with some spices, salt and pepper.
The main floor bedroom/bathroom had a very comfy bed and a built in space heater in the bathroom which felt really luxurious. Plenty of clean towels and washcloths too!
When inside we stayed mostly in the basement which had a little fireplace heater that kept the place very cozy.
We didn't sleep in the basement bedroom or loft but both looked very comfortable.
Overall 10/10, would definitely love to come back in spring!"
5846,87,Awesome cabin with beautiful views! Everything was very clean and tidy that had everything we needed for a weekend stay.
5847,87,"Spectacular view of mountains. Clean, quiet and cozy house with everything you need for a nice stay. Host easily available and pleasant to deal with."
5848,87,This was the second time we stayed here. The cabin was very clean and comfortable. The kitchen is small but very well stocked with everything you need to cook breakfast or dinner. The views are amazing and only minutes away from Valdese and Morganton. Nice restaurants and breweries close by.
5849,87,"Wonderful cabin perfect for romantic getaways, small family reunions, to catch up with friends, or just get away from it all and kick back, hike, read, watch a movie… We really enjoyed our stay and will likely come back. Super cozy place all around and the view is absolutely amazing. The photos don’t do it justice. Also an easy drive to Asheville and Charlotte."
5850,87,"Our stay was awesome, house was very clean and cozy. we had no problems getting there or checking in, Conveniently located near food and grocery stores."
5851,87,"This was our first experience with airbnb and what an amazing one it was. From day one Sherry was so hospitable and communicative. We felt like we were being taken care of the whole time. The views are stunning and the home cozy, but it's Sherry that really makes the experience something we've cherished."
5852,87,Absolutely lovely place!!! Exactly like the pictures but better. Views are beautiful and house so comfortable. Will definitely rent again. You want go wrong picking Sherry’s place. Great host!!!!!
5853,87,We had a very romantic stay at this beautiful location. Sherry was very responsive and the house was not located too far off road so it was easily accessible while also getting the entire mountain experience.
5854,87,"Beautiful home. Very clean. Nice quiet neighborhood. The host was very easy to communicate with and offered suggestions about the local surroundings. The was exactly what I expected from the listing, and I would recommend this home and this host to anyone."
5855,87,Very nice cabin! We especially enjoyed the rocking chairs on the back deck overlooking the lovely view. Sherry worked with us to allow us to check in a little early.
5856,87,"Cute, adorable amazing little cottage with an awesome view! Sherry was a great communicator. Didn't want to return to reality 😊"
5857,87,Amazing experience once again at Sherry’s adorable home !! The views are just amazing and spent most of the time on the porch. The Mexican restaurant in town is very good and also 100 Main restaurant. We love our get aways there and Sherry is the best hostess ever goes above and beyond!! Cannot wait for next time !!!
5858,87,"Gorgeous home with beautiful views
Sherry was great with communicating and checking in on us.
Everything about the stay was fantastic"
5859,87,"Excellent, extremely clean & cozy private cabin. It was very well furnished, & I highly enjoyed my time there."
5860,87,AMAZING VIEWS!! My husband and I had a amazing time. Communication with our host was fast and easy. The house is stunning with breathtaking views. Very very clean home. Will definitely be coming back.
5861,87,"We unfortunately could not make it to visit the cabin. However, Sherry was excellent with communication and very understanding. We definately hope to try again!"
5862,87,"I took a last minute stay here for to focus on work. It was an amazing experience with great views of Burke County. I never knew the views could get that great and and I didn’t have to take the time to drive out to the mountains (Boone, etc…). I would definitely rent again if I came back to the area."
5863,87,Beautiful home with amazing views. Very relaxing getaway.
5864,88,The home was conviently located but surprisingly private. Surrounded by trees on all sides and off a quiet road. Inside was remarkable. The simple white and open space maximized the foot print which made it a very comfortable stay . Every detail was carefully considered and well placed. We had a great time here and my family didn't want to leave.
5865,88,"delightful, private, clean accommodations. Perfect for the occasion, Laura was timely with responses, a generous host"
5866,88,"Rocky Knoll Hideaway was everything I could want in my own home let alone a perfect vacation retreat! We felt very welcome in the space. Laura provided snacks, smores, and the little addition of bedside candy dishes was so sweet. The decor was spot on and beautiful. The peace of the surrounding area was uncomparable. The privacy of the wooded lot was just right - even in winter/early Spring without leaves on the trees. I can't recommend Laura's rental enough if you just want to enjoy a homey feel away from home. It's not far from the interstate or restaurant/grocery options. Overall, we loved this place!"
5867,88,"UNREAL. Worth every penny. Besides the house being absolutely beautiful and decorated so peaceful and calming, it was immaculately clean, had everything you could think of and has the comfiest beds of any rental we’ve ever stayed. We could not find one single thing that we would change or that we needed, and that blew us away!! We stayed for a relaxing moms-wkd-away and after a visit to a local winery and a stop by the grocery store for essentials on Friday afternoon we ended up not even leaving the cottage! Their hospitality was top notch, the instructions left on the fridge provide everything you need to know and the reclining chairs were comfy enough to stay in literally all day. For those wanting to get out and explore 801 southern kitchen is THE PLACE TO EAT for breakfast/lunch and there was a ton of options around Bermuda Run area. Also so many wineries within 15 minutes. We loved how secluded it felt and cannot wait to come back for a couples stay!"
5868,88,"Laura’s cabin was just as described in her listing, but better. Great layout for two of us. Amenities were well-thought out and above what you would find at a typical listing. The small touches were appreciated; I wish it wasn’t raining, as the fire pit and s’mores were so tempting. Nothing rundown; all seemed very new. Laura was super responsive to messages and was gracious enough to help me back in after checkout for some forgotten items. Will look to rent this location any time I’m back in the area."
5869,88,This cottage is absolutely amazing! Peaceful setting but still a short drive to town and cities. Would highly recommend and will stay here again the next time I’m in the area.
5870,88,"Extremely clean, relaxing, comfortable, bright, and enjoyable. Greatly enjoyed our time here."
5871,88,Wish I could stay longer. Thank you for having such a great place!
5872,88,"Simply a magnificent place. Spotless, beautiful, and extremely relaxing. Very private and quiet setting. I've stayed at many airbnbs and this one was my favorite. I highly recommend this place. Well done."
5873,88,Great home spacious and located in a quiet area.
5874,88,"This place was perfect for a night get-away! Beautifully built/renovated, accommodating, so clean and peaceful."
5875,88,Beautiful place
5876,88,Perfect place for a weekend getaway.
5877,88,"Again the cottage was absolutely AMAZING!!! Beautiful cottage, all the items you may have forgotten provided. Clean, cozy home with beautiful woodsy views. I love the peace and serenity of this cottage."
5878,88,"Beautiful, immaculate house in lovely surroundings."
5879,88,"Absolutely charming little cottage, would definitely recommend."
5880,88,"It was a wonderful stay! A cozy come with all the amenities you could need. There was a nice little platter of snacks, and a bottle of wine. The beds were so comfy. And a wonderful shower!"
5881,88,"This little house is a pristine little getaway. Beautifully decorated, extremely clean and tidy and peaceful surroundings. The host has thought of everything and has the best little touches all around the house. Highly recommend!"
5882,88,"We adored this Airbnb! I loved all the thoughtful little touches Laura has put into this cozy home. Especially the Christmas tree idea since our stay was during Christmas. The fire pit out back was great! My children loved running around outside and we loved the private, yet convenient location. Laura’s place has everything you could need and we look forward to visiting again in the future!"
5883,88,"We rented this Air Bnb as a get away spot for my husband and I following a deployment, and it did not disappoint. If you're looking for a great staycation- this is it.

The house was pristine clean, Laura went out of her way to decorate for christmas, and there was plenty of amenities such as a s'mores bar, coffee/tea and creamer, small candys, that were so generous to offer.

The beds were VERY comfortable and while we wanted a stay cation in the knolwood house, we didn't have much option after catching a cold our second morning there. Having the TVs in the room, with a firestick meant we could rest in bed, comfortably, and binge watch tv like before we had kids.

The one slight downfall can be the lack of delivery options. We could get Instacart, and we were able to Door Dash as well but the options were slim based on the house location which was easily overcome when you see the privacy you get

We can't wait to stay again!"
5884,88,"Cozy cabin in the woods. My adulting children and I had a relaxing wonderful stay. We actually spent Thanksgiving there and had ample space to cook and the kitchen was well stocked. We loved the fire pit out back! We played bored games, relaxed and enjoyed the lovely space. We took several walks at Tanglewood park. There is a lot to do there. My daughter and I wanted to do a horse trail ride but they didn’t have any openings. It’s a peaceful country setting but close to stores and restaurants if needed. Wonderful place to stay. Very neat and clean…we would definitely stay there again."
5885,88,Absolutely BEAUTIFUL place! Would 10/10 recommend to anyone! Will definitely stay here again. Laura is sweet and responsive. A wonderful host!
5886,88,"Perfect accommodations, comfy and cozy in the woods. Everything you need for a home away from home. Impeccably clean, with so many special touches. Highly recommend!"
5887,88,"This place is AirBnB perfection ! Clean, comfortable, spacious, and with little touches to make you feel at home.
Not to forget the frendly hosts...We could not have asked for more. My only regret is that our stay was too brief. We hope to be back again soon. (Can I give it 6 out of 5 stars?)"
5888,88,"Our stay at Laura’s home was exactly what we needed. It’s a cozy cabin, nestled in a beautiful wooded area with all of the necessities (and some extra goodies) for a peaceful getaway."
5889,88,Such a cute little cottage! Great location and very clean!! We very much enjoyed our stay!
5890,88,We had a change of plans for our overnight stay..we were unable to stay as planned and we’re past the point of refund. A day later Laura checked on us to see if all was ok because she personally realized we hadn’t shown up..she refunded us our cleaning fee without any conversation. Thanks Laura for being a professional.
5891,88,"We absolutely loved our stay at this house. We came into town for a wedding and was pleasantly surprised by this house. Laura was very welcoming and accommodating. We very much appreciated all the attention to details; from the personal hand-written note, to snacks and s’mores on the counter, to fire starters and wood for the bonfire, and drinks in the fridge.

The house was in a lovely neighborhood; we felt safe and secure staying here. I’d recommend this place to anyone that’s in town. 10/10"
5892,88,Wonderful place to stay. So clean and cute with fire pit so you can be outside and enjoy the woods around it. Highly recommend!
5893,88,Beautiful little cottage in the woods!
5894,88,"The house was beautiful and so peaceful in the woods. Also, the host was very accommodating. This was one of our favorite Airbnb houses!"
5895,88,"Laura and Matt’s home was well appointed, very clean, and had amazing thoughtful touches (fresh cut flowers, snacks, s’mores, wine, and a personal note!). Highly recommend!"
5896,88,"Possibly the nicest, cleanest Airbnb I’ve ever visited. The house was beautiful, made even more beautiful by the setting. The hosts were also super kind and welcoming through all of our communication. Can’t recommend this place highly enough!"
5897,88,Lovely home. Recommend! 10 out of 10. Ditto to the previous 5star reviews...
5898,88,The best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in!! Extremely well equipped with everything we needed and more. Excellent hosts!
5899,88,Beautiful cabin in the woods. The house and property are lovely and well maintained. Exactly as described and perfect for few days. Nice attention to detail.
5900,88,"This house is brand new and was extremely clean when we arrived. The owners have spent a lot of time and effort to create a great Airbnb experience. It is very nicely decorated and has comfortable furniture. The new foam mattresses and high-quality bedding assure a great night sleep. The house is surrounded by forest, the crickets and sicadas provides cozy sound in the summer night. We spent one night in early September and we are planning to come back once again in the soon future. We give this five stars!"
5901,88,"We were shocked
by the level of care and detail in this stay…everything we could have considered was thoughtfully taken care of. Laura has created an incredibly cozy and quiet stay that far exceeded any expectations we may have had. Incredible. Thank you for a wonderful home away from home experience!"
5902,88,What a beautiful place!! All the small touches really make it feel like home. The hosts went above and beyond to provide a great space.
5903,88,"Laura is a to notch super host, all of the little touches from fresh flowers, a welcome note, wine & chocolates are a few if the little details that make you feel at ""home."" We will definitely stay here again."
5904,88,"We had an amazing stay. Laura was very responsive, and has really thought of every detail. So often when you rent a place as soon as you get unloaded you must rush to the grocery store, not here, Laura had bottle waters, sodas, a bottle of wine, chips, coffee, even a little kit for s’mores and that is just to mention a few. The house was so clean we felt like we were the first guest to ever stay. The bed (we only used one room) was so comfy, we slept great. The house was exactly as described and will be back for sure. There is not one thing that I can even think of that needs improvement. Thank you so much Laura for a wonderful stay!!!"
5905,88,Laura was an amazing host and was really great at communicating. All the little touches throughout the property were perfect. one of the best Airbnb properties we have stayed in the United States!
5906,88,We highly recommend staying at the little house by the woods! Laura is a great hostess!
5907,88,This is a superior value. Updated decorating and very clean. Many thoughtful extras placed throughout the home. You will be glad you rented this place!
5908,88,This is the nicest Airbnb I have ever stayed in. The house was welcoming and just made you feel at ease as soon as you walked in the door. My favorite little detail was the light switches. Each one was labeled so there was no confusion. Small details like that really sold this house as a “come and relax” destination. We loved the easy check out process.
5909,88,All of the little things you did made the getaway even better . It was like staying in a luxury siute in the middle of the woods . You really have a great place. We will be back for our next escape!
5910,88,"Great place and great host. Away from it all, but within a short drive of anything you might need. Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting the area."
5911,88,awesome quiet place! all ya need is here! very quiet. very clean! highly recommend .
5912,88,This is a beautiful ana quaint little cottage. Highly recommended. Great place for a quiet getaway. Wonderful hosts.
5913,88,"This is the most adorable house. Laura thought of everything to make our visit the best. Great attention to details. Even the fire pit was ready. The only thing we had to do was light the fire. Snacks, water, wine, coffee….she thought of it all. The perfect place to stay when visiting the Yadkin Valley."
5914,88,"Super gorgeous nice new cottage! We loved everything about the house but especially the back porch fire pit area. Super clean, super welcoming and comfy. So many special touches that made you feel like someone’s family coming to stay! Laura was so easy to work with!!! We would for sure stay again!"
5915,88,A wonderful get away. The owners think of yhe little things that others don't. You can't go wrong choosing this place.
5916,88,"A perfect little getaway off the beaten path. All of the comforts of home in a lovely, quiet hamlet in the woods. Hosts are generous and accommodating. Only minutes from the city, yet couldn't feel further removed. Do yourself a favor and visit the local winery. (The hosts were kind enough to include a bottle)."
5917,88,We loved this little cottage nestled in the woods! Laura thought of everything we could possibly need during our stay. It is well appointed and just the right size for a family of four. It has a feel of being off the beaten path but is close to restaurants and gas stations. We enjoyed morning coffee on the front patio/porch but didn’t get a chance to relax by the fire pit …… next time!
5918,88,Laura’s place perfect for our getaway. It was very clean and provided the most comfortable stay. Sitting in the backyard listing to the birds while enjoying a glass of wine was relaxing. We highly recommend staying here and look forward to returning soon!
5919,88,"The most amazing AirBnB I have ever stayed at! Laura is an amazing host who thinks of any possible thing you could need she has prepared for it. This house was absolutely beautiful and on a very quiet road. The beds are very comfortable, and when you walk in it instantly feels like home. Definitely will be back to this amazing home!"
5920,88,"This place was BEAUTIFUL. We had the pleasure of being their first guests and they did not disappoint. The house made us feel like we were at home. It was perfect. Very secluded and quiet but not far from town, great location. Laura and Matthew were great hosts and made sure we had everything we needed, including snacks and drinks. We will definitely stay here again. Highly recommended!!"
5921,89,"Roy & Rebecca’s little getaway is very nice, clean and in a peaceful and beautiful location on Pages Creek.! They had all amenities as described and we would definitely recommend for those visiting Wilmington.

Thank you both for an awesome place to spend our weekend getaway!

Gary & Kim"
5922,89,"What a wonderful place for a getaway! We had an amazing time paddleboarding, watching sunrises and relaxing by the water. Roy and Rebecca's place exceeded our expectations. From sharp knives in the kitchen, to extra soft TP, to fresh picked flowers, Roy and Rebecca go the extra mile to make a great experience for guests."
5923,89,Roy and Rebecca's cottage is a home away from home. Very clean and as pictured. We will be booking again in the future when going back to Wilmington. Thank you again for allowing us to stay in your wonderful cozy cottage.
5924,89,Wonderful getaway at the cottage! Great location and space. Thanks Roy & Rebecca!
5925,89,"We really enjoyed our stay at the cottage. It had everything we needed and so much more. We used the Ninja to bake biscuits and heat up bacon for breakfast and to air fry some leftovers--it was quite handy! I slept very well on the pull out futon/sofa while my son enjoyed the comfortable bed. The bathroom was unique and very nice. The artwork in the cottage is fabulous! We had hoped to fish from the dock but windy, cold, rainy weather kept us from that. The water was the same depth all the way to the end of the dock which was interesting since the creek is so wide. The creek is very beautiful, and even more so at night with all the dock lights. The location is convenient to the entire area--the river walk and the beaches are all about 20 minutes away. We truly enjoyed our stay at Roy and Rebecca's cottage."
5926,89,"We had an excellent stay , already planning a trip back !"
5927,89,We absolutely loved this place! Perfect for just the 2 of us! The view was absolutely beautiful! Definitely will be going back. Such a perfect get away for the weekend! 😊
5928,89,"This was a beautiful small cottage.
Beautiful views and nice peaceful atmosphere. Really worth it!"
5929,89,"Beautiful place. Really enjoyed our stay and the kind hospitality of Roy and Rebecca. Waking up each morning to the gorgeous waterfront was amazing! Boys enjoyed fishing, kayaking and paddleboarding from the house."
5930,89,All instructions were clear starting with finding the location to were to place our trash on our last day. Beautiful property and very clean and well taken care of cottage. Perfect location to be close enough to downtown to enjoy the night life but far enough away to be secluded. Great little place for a romantic get away with your partner.
5931,89,"It was an extremely peaceful getaway thing right on the water, was serene and very private. We enjoyed every minute."
5932,89,Amazing stay with even better views. Completely easy check in and check out at everything that I could possibly need. Will definitely be staying here again.
5933,89,"If I could give 5+ stars I would. Rebecca and Roy are gracious hosts who have put a lot of thought and love into this warm, welcoming cottage. We felt completely at home here. It is such a peaceful and serene home.

Well stocked with everything we needed or would need. Bring along a yoga mat and meditation cushion and you can have a unique personal retreat. Bring along your partner and you can have a relaxing, romantic weekend. You can only go right when you choose this cottage!"
5934,89,"What an wonderful, relaxing trip we experienced at the Creekside Cottage! Roy and Rebecca are the most excellent hosts and have created such an inviting space.

From the pictures on the listing I could tell that this was the spot where we wanted to have a weekend getaway, and the reality exceeded that.

The natural beauty of the creek is all the entertainment you’d need, but wifi and cable are readily available. We had morning coffee and evening talks watching the sun on the water and listening to the birds… so peaceful!

The cottage is on the owner’s property, but very private and nestled in a quiet neighborhood. It is very well done, perfectly clean, and has all the amenities one would need. We were pleasantly surprised at the comfy mattress… not too hard, not too soft, but just right!

We will definitely return to the Creekside Cottage soon!"
5935,89,This place is peaceful and beautiful!
5936,89,"SUCH a lovely airbnb experience! The place is even better in person- with all the amenities you need. Rebecca and Roy (and Buttercup!) are incredible hosts- so helpful and kind. The bed is super comfy, bathroom is huge with an amazing shower, view from the cozy porch is stunning, and the kayak was so fun! Want to come back to Wilmington JUST to stay in this place again :)"
5937,89,Absolutely a fabulous place to stay with extremely accommodating hosts. We would highly recommend this place.
5938,89,"This small cottage was perfect & exceeded all expectations. We enjoyed the beautiful views, visiting with family on the screened-in porch, fishing & kayaking. The kitchen was well stocked with everything we needed to prepare meals. The bathroom is large & we especially loved the shower. Roy & Rebecca were so nice & accommodating. Roy gave us an orientation to the creek when we arrived & it was nice to know if we had questions or needed anything, they were on-site or just a text/call away."
5939,89,"We absolutely loved our stay here. The cottage is decorated nicely, is clean and has the most amazing view!! We ventured into Wilmington during the day but spend the rest of the time on the deck overlooking the water. We even decided to have food delivered in for dinner because the view was so nice and it was so peaceful. We hope that we need to stay In Wilmington again as we would love to stay here."
5940,89,"Relaxing on Pages Creek was such a nice vacation! We could not have asked for more. Roy and Rebecca are very welcoming and generous hosts. The location is close to amenities and the beaches, without the feel of being in a tourist area. It was very quiet, all you could ever hear were boats goings by, birds, and the splash of jumping mullet fish. Pages Creek was great for kayaking, especially during the week. Roy will give you the lay of the land/creek. We hope to come back again for another relaxing stay!"
5941,89,"This cottage was such a special treat. Tucked away in a quiet neighborhood but yet close enough to see everything Wilmington has to offer. The view from the porch is breathtaking, we enjoyed spending our mornings out there sipping coffee before starting our day. Roy and Rebecca communicated very well and had everything you could need available in their cottage. We truly enjoyed our stay and would recommend this place to anyone visiting the area!"
5942,89,"Absolutely perfect is all I can say about my stay. If you’re looking at this listing just go ahead and book it, you will not regret it."
5943,89,"We had an amazing stay, wish we could have stayed longer. This cottage is the perfect place to stay for couples. It's quiet, clean, and an incredible view to wake up to. We really enjoyed sitting on the screened in porch while having breakfast and enjoying the water front view.
Roy is extremely knowledgeable of the area and gave us a nice run down of the waterway. They have just about everything you need in this cottage to enjoy a nice getaway.
We will definitely be coming back!!!"
5944,89,"Roy & Rebecca are very nice and pleasant hosts.
The cottage was very clean and we
liked the interieur very much. The
communication was great, also
the excursions on the water.
We would love to come again.
Juliette & René"
5945,89,This place is awesome. Love the setup and the comfort of the entire place. Perfect inshore location just far enough from everything to be nice and quiet but not too far where you don't want to go enjoy what the area has to offer. Roy was nice to chat with and insightful. Looking forward to my next stay!
5946,89,"Roy and Rebecca are great hosts! Their cottage is very clean and quiet. Being right on the water make for a nice place to relax or take advantage of the water and have some fun.

Thank you for the hospitality Roy and Rebecca!"
5947,89,Beautiful well stocked cabin with a view. Hosts are very responsive. Felt like home.
5948,89,"It was our first time in Wilmington and our time here was wonderful! Roy and Rebecca were great hosts and were extremely hospitable and generous. Communication was very easy and we got quick responses to all of our messages. They even helped with our tire when it was low on air!

The cottage was so beautiful and we were amazed as soon as we stepped in. The water view was just as stunning, especially at sunset out on the dock. The place was very tidy and clean, and it was fully equipped with everything we possibly needed to feel at home. Although we did not have time to use the kayaks and paddle boards, the orientation we got when we first arrived was very helpful. We loved staying here and definitely recommend booking this stay! Will definitely be back in the future!"
5949,89,"This Airbnb has the nicest scenery ever! It was clean and you have everything you need there. The water activities were definitely a plus! Roy took us on a boat ride with Buttercup their doggy and it was beautiful! Definitely can’t wait to come back again.

Roy and Rebecca are the sweetest people. They are there to help with anything you need to know about the area and makes sure you enjoy your stay. 😊"
5950,89,Fantastic place. Excellent location. Idyllic setting and great hosts. Super clean and well stocked!
5951,89,"This is it! You’ve found the perfect getaway spot. Live in wilmington and need to get away without leaving town? This is your spot!
This quiet, romantic location has everything you need and these are the perfect hosts.
We’ll be back!"
5952,89,"This is the most outstanding airbnb that I have ever stayed at.

A private cottage located directly on Pages Creek in Wilmington, it has the feel of staying at an Inn. The cottage is newly built this year and everything in it is also brand new, fully outfitted and stocked with equipment to cook meals, grill and comfortably stay in and never leave, if that’s what you’d like! There were even special touches like fresh cut flowers and a new bag of ice in the freezer.
It is a true getaway, as it’s completely private, directly on the water with a screened porch, beautiful views and great access to the water.
The hosts, Roy and Rebecca, are on the property and very responsive and available to help. When I arrived they offered me an orientation of the creek and the kayak and paddle boards equipment, so I was able to kayak on my own the next day. And the following morning they took me on a guided paddle board excursion - incredible!
Their knowledge of the area is extensive and they are able to offer restaurant suggestions and local entertainment guidance as well.
You will be missing the opportunity of a lifetime if you do not spend time at this waterfront cottage, I guarantee you.
A beyond five star experience."
5953,89,"I had an amazing time at the cottage. Beautiful location, great hosts, perfect getaway spot. Will definitely be back!"
5954,89,"Expect a nice, clean, and relaxing stay! I felt like I was at home!"
5955,89,"This Cottage is an incredible stay! We enjoyed coffee each morning on the cottage deck, breathing fresh ocean air and watching earlybirds boat and paddleboard around the channel. When we were ready to enjoy the water ourselves, Roy greeted us with helpful tips for navigating the channel and made sure we were comfortable with the kayaks.

The Cottage itself is a very comfy getaway spot for two. The bed slept like a dream and the shower deserves five stars all on its own. No more than a 20-minute drive from both downtown Wilmington and the beach, I can't recommend Roy and Rebecca's place enough!"
5956,89,"Our stay was wonderful, this was our 2nd time to creekside cottage! I would recommend anyone to stay here it’s so peaceful and the sunrises are beautiful!"
5957,89,"What a greatvplace to stay. Grat location, well appointed furnishings and accessories and a great relaxing view."
5958,89,"Don’t hesitate when you see creekside cottage, book it !! It’s everything you can imagine for a great little getaway the host are wonderful! The sunrise and sunsets are beautiful. Everything you need is right there!"
5959,89,We loved staying here. It is a great location. So peaceful and beautiful out there on the water. Roy and Rebecca were the best host. They are only a phone call away if you have any questions or need anything. We will definitely be staying here again for years to come.
5960,90,The stay is exactly what you would expect! wonderful private location extremely peaceful surroundings and a very cozy innovative space. Jessie and Logan were extremely responsive even late at night when we had a power outage due to some storms. they ensured they checked on us to make sure we were doing all right!
5961,90,Had a fun stay loved the view.
5962,90,"This is a great place to stay if you want to be able to do a variety of activities! Asheville and great hiking spots are within a reasonable driving distance, and the Burnsville area is really lovely, and has a nice brewery/pizza restaurant. My only recommendations would be that you pack light - because the space is so small, there isn’t much room to put your things - and bring a pair of shower shoes/flip flops/Crocs/etc. as the shower and toilet are in the same space and your feet might get wet while using the restroom. Otherwise, this is a great, affordable place to stay for a quick trip!"
5963,90,What a great gem! We truly enjoyed our stay! It was beautiful and what a view! Everything was provided and super clean. We will be back! Everything was as described and pictures are accurate!
5964,90,Glad you had a good time!!
5965,90,Nice little spot on the top of the hill. Tiny home was just as advertised and my dog and I had a great stay!
5966,90,Glad y’all enjoyed it Nick!
5967,90,"Location is beautiful, but I ended up canceling after the first night.

Unfortunately the pipes froze overnight, even with taps opened up at a drip. I am also not sure that the heater is adequate for the space, as it was freezing throughout the night. I attempted to sleep in the additional ""sleeping"" area closer to the heater, but it was very uncomfortable. There is only a very thin mattress topper there on top of hardwood. I would say it is inaccurate that this location could sleep additional people outside of lofted bed, so 2 max.

The wifi mentioned in the listing was non existent and you willget a very sporadic cell signal. This isn't a huge deal if you are looking to unplug, I mention simply because this does not match the listing description. It does make it difficult to communicate problems timely with the hosts.

I would not recommend this for cold weather as the space does not seem outfitted to handle the lower temperatures."
5968,90,"Thank you for the feedback, as always. This is our first winter booking with this house and we now feel we have all the kinks worked out. No other guest has complained about the heating unit so it’s possible it was on the wrong the setting. We did give a full refund for your stay and would hope that would have been more than enough to make your time worthwhile."
5969,90,Great weekend getaway! I would highly recommend for couples who love to be outside and want to experience the tiny home life for a weekend.
5970,90,You are welcome back anytime!
5971,90,Very good place! The tiny home was clean and situated in a beautiful landscape. Hosts were responsive and helpful.
5972,90,"Wonderful stay. It’s a simple tiny home with all the necessities. Was even able to grill out in the fire pit.

Two things to note: It’s very minimal so there’s 2 beds and no other seating, and the toilet and shower are together. So essentially when you take a shower, the toilet’s in their beside you.

I loved the view and the isolation. The beds were comfortable. Everything I needed was available. They hosts were available! And one thing I loved is how much they put into letting you know about all the amenities in the area.

It was a great stay!"
5973,90,It was a wonderful place to stay with a beautiful view.
5974,90,It was a nice and clean tiny home! Surprised by the amount of storage. The Wi-Fi didn’t always work so I usually used my data. Pretty close to some good hiking spots 😊 loved that I could use all 8 of the big soft pillows provided because I was by myself
5975,90,"A very beautiful place , quiet and peaceful"
5976,90,"I was only there one night. The steep hill could be a challenge for future guests with cars. This is the start of a tiny home community, but because it is on the hill, each tiny house has a nice front deck view of the countryside below. Jessie and Logan were very creative in building a tiny vacation home from a horse trailer. Rustic, but you do have the basics. Rain shower and toilet are in a tiled area under the loft bed. I do love their entrepreneurial efforts."
5977,90,A perfect stay for a quiet Valentine’s getaway. We brought our puppy in his first vacation and he loved it!
5978,90,"A charming tiny home that has been beautifully finished with a great mountain view. Just 5 minutes from main street in Burnsville which is a lively, friendly town. This was my second time visiting and i love this little city. Jessie and Logan were very responsive - i did have a few bumps when the breakers tripped and Jessie and Logan adv how i could attempt resetting them, something to be mindful of when cooking it might trip if you use more than one appliance at a time. The home was clean - the only thing that seemed out of place was the vent in the bathroom which was open and hanging from one side when we arrived. Another thing to be mindful of is that because it is a trailer conversion is the lack of insulation, so on very cold night be sure to crank the mini split and drip the faucet to avoid frozen pipes and a cold night. Overall we had a great time. Good ammendities (dishes, cookware, spices all as described)"
5979,90,"This tiny home was the perfect place to recharge at the end of the day. It's nestled in the hills outside of Burnsville with a great/private view, while still being close enough to town to get the things you need. The inside felt very cozy (especially the lofted bed!), but I noticed an unpleasant smell from the bathroom one day after forgetting to shut the shower curtain and leaving for the day. Showers also have to stay under 10 minutes as that seems to be when the hot water runs out. Other than those bathroom issues, I would still stay here again!"
5980,90,Thanks so much Robbie! The bathroom issue has been completely resolved. Thank you for bringing it to our attention. You are welcome back any time!
5981,90,"The tiny house was adorable and practical but a little difficult to locate. All in all, we enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend!"
5982,90,We had a GREAT stay at this cute little tiny home ! It snowed the whole time we were there but still had a lot of fun. Host checked on us multiple times to make sure we were okay during this winter storm that moved through.
5983,91,"Great stay, will definitely be back! Thank you!"
5984,91,Loved our stay at the A frame! Very private and secluded yet close enough to great hikes and downtown Asheville.
5985,91,"Second time here, love it just as much as the first time I stayed ❤️ ill be back soon 😁"
5986,91,"Last min stay for my birthday get away from the city. Beautiful location, quiet and peaceful."
5987,91,This is a great little escape to get off the grid!
5988,91,Great experience!
5989,91,It is a wonderful spot!
5990,91,This cozy and private A-frame is perfect for a weekend getaway! Loved the location and the huge fire pit! This listing is Dog friendly and a perfect place to bring our fur babies! Would stay again!
5991,91,My second time visiting this awesome spot ! Highly recommend and will be back again. Haley is always a great host !
5992,91,"We loved our stay at the A-frame! Location was secluded and surroundings were beautiful. We arrived during the day and thought directions were easy to follow. The fire pit was amazing and overlooked the beautiful mountains! There was plenty of space inside the a-frame for my partner, myself, and our two large dogs. We would definitely return for another camping experience!"
5993,91,"My fiancé and I needed a weekend getaway in the woods away from the busy day to day life of being PhD students and this did the trick!! We brought our dog with us and did an extended weekend where we just enjoyed the lack of cell service, the sounds of nature and peacefulness of privacy. We would definitely recommend if you are looking for some peace and quiet. Added benefit is that it was super close to a lot of the mountain biking my fiancé enjoys so that was another easy selling point for us. (Also the fire pit is amazing!)"
5994,91,"This place was AMAZING!!! Seriously so cool! My best friend and I loved it, it was everything we could ask for! Beautiful views, super private, close to Asheville! Getting to it was fine, just a heads up that the roads are steep and narrow so show up during the daytime if you can! Also, AWD does help, like Haley said but overall my best friends Camry handled it just fine. Thank you so much, I would stay here again any time!"
5995,91,"Awesome spot, super out there! Just the way I like it. I will definitely be back. If you have a flare for adventure and are not scared of mountain roads you should definitely book this gem!!!!"
5996,91,Great stay! Really good for dogs. Good hiking area around.
5997,91,"Perfect camping spot without having to set up tent. Secluded, beautiful views, huge fire pit. Amazing!"
5998,91,"The A frame cabin is nicely spacious. We brought a queen air mattress to sleep on and it had plenty of space to fit. Our dogs loved sniffing around, and we enjoyed the beautiful night sky and the peaceful mornings. We will definitely be back :)"
5999,91,"Wonderful host and contact, responsive and informative on all subjects."
6000,91,If you're looking for a peaceful and beautiful nature get-away this is the place.
6001,91,We loved this stay!! The views were incredible - the location allows for both a sunset and sunrise!! The lot that the A-Frame was located on was the perfect size. Enough room for our dog to run around and play fetch as well.
6002,91,I enjoy my stay at Hailey’s it’s nice a peaceful. Wish I could have stayed longer but because of the weather and not fully prepared I had to leave. 😞 Haley and Christy were so understanding and friendly when I had to change my days in the middle of my stay. The ride up is a little rough though definitely need a car that can go up hills easier and better direction to the A frame would have been better. I love to fire 🔥 pit and my dogs loved being out in nature I would definitely come back.
6003,91,"Absolutely cannot say enough about this place. If you’re into Primitive camping and looking for a little charm with an amazing view, this is the place for you! Private and secluded, sitting right inside the mountains…the A frame can be turned into whatever you make it.
No electricity, No shower, No heat but the portable restroom was clean and only for your use. Even without these small luxuries, we would stay here over and over again. Did we mention the view?
Driving in: After reading the reviews we were a little nervous about driving in at night but we had to do so. Personally, we(2 women) didn’t find it difficult to navigate. Just for reference a “switch back” is a sharp turn. Since the walk down from parking is steep, I would stop at A frame sign and unload there.
Haley and Christy were amazing. Their recommendations for food and hiking were on point. We saw their other properties on the way up the mountain and each looks just as unique and amazing as the A Frame. Will be back!"
6004,91,The A Frame is perfect if you’re looking for a little more shelter than tent camping. The location is amazing with a beautiful winter view of MT Pisgah through the trees! Very peaceful pretty property and clean cozy cabin even in January. The firepit is great and nice to have a picnic table to prep/eat at. We look forward to visiting during other seasons :)
6005,91,My husband and I really enjoyed A-Frame for a quick weekend getaway! Reading the reviews and manual definitely helped us prepare to find the location and the weather. It snowed while we were there and the buddy heater came in handy! Very secluded. The Porta potty was VERY clean. We brought our own toilet paper for personal reasons but there is toilet paper provided in it. The directions were spot on and not hard to find during the day time. Definitely travel to A-Frame during day light! Would 100% recommend and we plan to come back in the spring!
6006,91,"The A-frame is a absolutely wonderful get away! The drive up was really simple and leads up to a beautiful, peaceful site! Haley was really helpful and made sure I had everything I needed! I look forward to coming back!"
6007,91,"WE FELL IN LOVE WITH THIS A-FRAME!!! While we were there, we already started dreaming of our next trip back, saying we need to book soon because once word gets out it will be booked so fast! The surroundings were beautiful. We woke up in a cloud the first morning, and when it cleared we were looking at a beautiful skyline. Nothing bad to say. The grounds were pristine :) Cannot wait to come back this summer."
6008,91,"I loved our stay here so much! It was truly so beautiful. The hosts were incredibly helpful as well. They responded almost immediately to any questions we had. Definitely make sure you’re prepared for the weather in the winter months - cold weather camping gear worked for me, but you would likely want a heater as well. All in all, one of the coolest places I’ve stayed from Airbnb and would 100% recommend."
6009,91,"Haley’s place was truly in a beautiful location and it was a cool cabin to stay at! In the winter, I would bring a lot of blankets and layers, as it does get very cold inside but other than that, it was fun and I would stay here again!"
6010,91,"We loved it! This place was so peaceful and quiet. It was definitely cold at night so bring enough blankets during the winter months, but the fireplace was huge so you can keep yourself warm by a big fire."
6011,91,What a pretty place!
6012,91,This spot is amazing! We will definitely be back!
6013,91,"Great mountainside getaway. I would definitely stay at any of Haley’s locations. I would recommend a 4 wheel drive in inclement weather. Easy access to local grocers and convenience stores in the event you forgot something.
Highly recommend!"
6014,91,So nice and quiet out there! Highly reccomend booking this place!
6015,91,Loved my stay! Such a unique area to camp at and everything was exactly as described. Will definitely be staying on the mountain again sometime in the future!
6016,91,"If you are looking for a quiet, off-grid get away, this place is the best! This is an authentic camping experience, but with the cool see-through A-Frame instead of a tent. You will need to bring your own lighting if you want to see clearly at night, and you should be ready to cook on the grill or over the fire. Obviously, you should bring a heater in the cooler months because the inside temperature is comparable to the outside until the sun starts to hit it. The views and hiking around the area are fantastic. I love how this listing is basically a blank slate for whatever you want it to be."
6017,91,What a perfect spot to get away!! Everything was nice and tidy and gave the perfect opportunity to just walk in and relax! I will definitely be staying again!!
6018,91,"Everything was great!!! Location, communication. I definitely conquered my fear of heights in a good way 😊"
6019,91,Cute place. Great if you like camping and are looking for a cheap place near Asheville.
6020,91,Incredible Airbnb! So unique and beautiful! Haley is also super communicative and so nice!
6021,91,"Beautiful Spot, as advertised. Will be back."
6022,91,"Highly recommend this a frame! Very quiet, cozy and comfortable. This area is close to Asheville as well as the Blue Ridge Parkway, but if you just want to hang out at the site it is so perfect! This was our second stay at Haley’s properties and we will be back again!"
6023,91,Such a beautiful spot for a quick weekend getaway! Haley was a wonderful host and communicated everything very effectively. Would definitely stay at her properties again!
6024,91,"We’ve had the pleasure of visiting twice now, making it a point to return this last weekend after visiting last fall. This is such a beautiful, special property, especially if you’re interested in traditional camping with a few added comforts, like the fire pit and star gazing from the glass-like tent. I would advise brushing up on wildlife safety, though we haven’t experienced anything dangerous - there’s definitely evidence of critters and our dog made us aware of something creeping up on us while cooking but it was easily spooked with a light. Very fun, secluded, adventurous, comfortable, and beautiful scenery."
6025,91,Very peaceful
6026,91,The cutest place to stay.
6027,91,"Great views, cool location. Very primitive so make sure you’re packed and ready. Great for someone looking for privacy and seclusion. Awesome stay."
6028,91,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Loved the privacy and seclusion. A Frame was the perfect size for a weekend stay for 2 adults. The heart of Asheville was an easy 20 minute drive. Wonderful getaway for a semi-adventurous couple. We'll be back.
6029,91,"Remote, quiet, quaint and picturesque. BE PREPARED! It gets cold and the floor of the A Frame is steel. Also, make sure you get there during the day because the drive is treacherous. Great if you like primitive camping!"
6030,91,"I wish I can give it more than 5 stars!! This place was perfect! The A-Frame is beautifully built, the plexiglass gives you a 360 degree view of the forest and sky which was perfect this time of year in the fall! The drive is is very steep but it’s expected since it’s in the mountains. Hailey’s directions were very helpful and got us right up. The campsite is secluded and so peaceful!! Large fire pit with 4 comfortable wooden chairs. Bring your own firewood** There is a charcoal grill with 2 utensils provided but we ended up bringing our own camp stove so we didn’t need it. The solar lights in the A frame is the cherry on top!! Absolutely loved and will be back in the future!!"
6031,91,A great place to get grounded and back intouch with your inner being. I highly recommend 👌
6032,91,Great stay. Just make sure to get there during the day. A little hard to navigate and set up at night since there are no lights. Beautiful views!
6033,91,We loved the A-frame! A perfect feel for sleeping under the stars with the securement of a structure. Highly recommend bringing an air mattress.
6034,91,"Wow, we were blown away at this glamping spot! The manual covered everything you would ever need to know about the property, the views were stunning and the a-frame was so gorgeous to look at. Haley’s special touches were everywhere: the solar happy lights, the s’mores skewers, the great firepit seating. We can’t wait to come back!!"
6035,91,"This Airbnb is truly and one of a kind experience! My husband and I came to Asheville for our honeymoon and we decided we would enjoy camping in this A-frame property. It is exactly as described! It is definitely difficult to get to at night, so go for the first time during the daylight. The roads are windy and steep so make sure your car can handle it! We loved the amazing views and sounds of nature around us. The Porta potty was very convenient as well. It is a must stay if you enjoy being surrounded by the outdoors!"
6036,91,"We had a great weekend here, definitely will visit again!"
6037,91,"Incredible, we had our wedding here and it could not have been better, more beautiful, clean, picturesque, perfect."
6038,91,This spot is AMAZINGGGGG!! Secluded but still close to hiking trails and stores and was kid friendly. The small details just made this spot even better. And the views were just breathtaking! Planning my next trip to come back next year! 😁 thanks for having us.
6039,91,the most relaxing place in the world! thank you so much Haley for making our trip so great. We will definitely come back!
6040,91,"Haley’s stay was so delightful and had a great morning view! Little difficult to find at night, but we were aware of that! It was a very dreamy stay!"
6041,91,We had a great time at the A-Frame. It was relaxing and private. We loved the views of the mountains and being surrounded by nature. We will definitely keep this site in mind for our next visit. Thanks!
6042,91,Beautiful property- my husband and I loved staying here with our dog. Just about 30 min from Asheville and absolutely perfectly remote otherwise- would love to stay here again someday!
6043,91,The A frame cabin was absolutely lovely! Unfortunately during our stay it did rain during the nights but it was actually very peaceful hearing the rain hit the windows. Love the privacy and view of the mountains between the trees! Definitely a great experience and would love to check out their other listings for our next visit.
6044,91,Loved this spot! Awesome hosts and great stay! The manual has everything you’ll need to know!
6045,91,"Camping here was such an awesome experience! A friend stayed here last year, and after seeing her pictures, I knew I’d have to check it out at some point. When I decided that I wanted to visit Asheville, I knew where’d I’d be staying. The site itself was easy to find, especially with the written directions. The A-frame itself was really, really cool! The provided table and fire pit were nice additions! The area is really quiet, and you’d never know that you’re only 30 minutes from downtown Asheville. I would 100% recommend anyone thinking about staying here to go ahead and book it! I’m already planning another trip to Asheville for next year, and will probably look at some of the other sites that they have at Pisgah Highlands."
6046,91,Hands down our new favorite spot to vacation. We secretly hope this remains a hidden gem 😊
6047,91,"Such an incredible place !
Very remote which I enjoyed but I just recommend screenshooting the directions and map before loosing service and getting there before dark."
6048,91,"This place is awesome, so perfect for a trip away from home if you’re into nature 💕"
6049,91,Simplistic perfection in the middle of nowhere. Would definitely stay again!!
6050,91,"Second time visiting the A-frame and just as lovely as the first. It rained a few times, so we hunkered down in the A-frame with books and games. Such a nice alternative to proper camping - being able to enjoy the site even in rain is sort of amazing and difficult to do in a full-on tent. Both nights were clear, so we were still able to have fires and explore the property. Great location, Haley is always communicative and kind, beautiful setting, and easy to access."
6051,91,Loved the A-Frame house! Was an awesome time being away from everyone and everything. It was really breezy and the air flow was comfortable during one of the hot weeks in the summer! I would definitely come back.
6052,91,"This little A frame was great if you’re looking for camping and privacy but want to stay in something sturdier than a tent! This is a primitive site! It’s a beautiful spot tho with enough room for us and our two large dogs, both indoor and outside.

In the July heat, we found the area to be fine temp wise since it’s mostly shaded, cooler up on the mountain than in town, and wasn’t too hot for sleeping esp if there was a breeze coming in the little window. We explored during the day and relaxed at the site in the evenings.

Getting there: the road is definitely steep and very winding. I would recommend coming in during the day for the first time as well as printing out Haley’s instructions beforehand-we didn’t have good cell service. Her info was very helpful as well as the signs denoting each rental along the way up the road.

We have a pick up truck so didn’t find anywhere too hard to navigate; I think a car would be fine as long as the road is in good condition. I would definitely not drive down to the well tho, we were slipping in 4 wheel drive-park on the pavement and walk down the gravel road. We loved the taste of the water but just an fyi we left it run for a few seconds to minimize the sediment.

As other reviews said, we saw a bear the first morning but it ran off quickly as soon as our dogs barked!

We loved this unique stay and would highly recommend it for anyone looking to enjoy nature!!"
6053,91,"We loved our stay at this secluded a-frame. It was just as I pictured it. A lot of recent reviews mentioned bears, which kind of freaked me out even though I’m a nature girl, but I didn’t see any. We were careful about bear precautions and had no issues. Surprisingly the a-frame was ventilated enough and high enough on the mountain with decent tree cover that even though temps were high, sleeping at night was quite pleasant. I brought a battery powered fan and didn’t need it. I found the map confusing, but that’s maybe just me, as we struggled to find the well until the second day(fyi it’s covered in a white tarp and from afar might look like a tent🙃). I would totally stay here again."
6054,91,"What a wonderful destination, very accurate description and easy to follow instructions. Thank you so much for this accommodation :)"
6055,91,"Everything was great! The location is very private and overall, fairly easy to get to. Would definitely recommend"
6056,91,Beautiful spot and great location. We hope to go back!
6057,91,I’ve been staying AirBNB for business and personal purposes for a little over two years. This is the coolest spot I’ve found yet! Absolutely amazing!
6058,91,This was an awesome place to stay and camp. It is a quick drive to Asheville. It is kind of hard to find so daylight is best. I didn’t want to leave!
6059,91,"This campsite is secluded, unique, and turns truly magical at nighttime with the lights shining through the A-frame. If you enjoy primitive camping, you’ll absolutely love this spot."
6060,91,Awesome experience!
6061,91,We looooved our A-frame and everything it comes with. It’s just perfect. Definitely try to get there before dark as gets a little tricky at night. I highly recommend reading the house manual-it has answers to all questions one can possibly have. The place is decorated with lights and made it absolutely lovely. Bring firewood and sit around the giant fire pit and just enjoy the mountains and the stars at night.
6062,91,"LOVED my time here! The property was beautiful with so many pretty views. Definitely recommend, especially if you’re looking for a little getaway with doggies!"
6063,91,"You can’t beat the location it’s so beautiful and truly away from everything!

We wish the description was much more clear and detailed. Directions are very hard to follow, I recommend signs being put up showing you that you are on the right path. The bathroom was very clean but far away.

Also, in some spots only 4WD can make it. Very very steep.

Make sure you bring firewood!"
6064,91,A great romantic getaway
6065,91,Dreamy!
6066,91,"What a cute, rare gem hidden outside Asheville! We had a great time! Very simple set up but yet everything you need.
If I was to change anything it would be more signs letting you know your on the right path. The roads are incredibly steep and might be super intimidating to some if they have to turn around. There is zero service up on the mountain so you can’t look up directions or anything on your phone if it’s not already loaded. Also, the outhouse is a bit far from the cabin.
Other than that, it’s just glamping so no frills needed! Be prepared for bears. We had a good size fella on our last morning. 🐻"
6067,91,"lovely experience at this property. loved how out of the way and secluded this a-frame was.
Haley was great with reaching out and giving us all the information we needed.
Be prepared for critters visiting. Had a bear visit us.
my only critique is there is no dumpster near the A frame."
6068,91,"This was such an amazing experience, my boyfriend, pup and I absolutely loved it and highly recommend to anyone thinking about going. We even got there at dusk and were fine! Go ahead and book - you'll have a blast!"
6069,91,This adorable A frame is off the beaten path but it is in such a wonderful quiet location. We were greeted by a group of male turkeys and the view by the 2 chairs at the bottm of the hill is breath taking. Simple and sweet just what our family needed!
6070,91,"Beautiful spot on the edge of the mountains in the pisgah footlands! Isolated, peaceful and just the type of place to get away from it all. Definitely camp in camp out so plan ahead and arrive during daylight for sure. Appreciate the little touches like twinkle lights on the A frame and box with some necessities (still bring your own). We would love to visit again soon! GPS tip: when it tells you that you’ve arrived keep going further."
6071,91,"We LOVED the A frame! Simple and secluded, which was perfect for our family of 3+dog. Perfect location for hiking, Blue Ridge parkway and Asheville. Weather is perfect this time of year."
6072,91,This is a beautiful set up! We loved the privacy and the views of the mountains. Definitely will book again!
6073,91,"Definitely off the grid and so private in an amazing way. Easy to get to Asheville and explore though! We enjoyed the privacy and the ease to adventure. Everything was just as stated, clean and cute as can be!! Can’t wait to stay at the other locations! Or go back to this one."
6074,93,"Cat was very cute! Space was cozy and clean, instructions were thorough and helpful. Would recommend!"
6075,93,"We arrived after a long 8 hour drive on a very stormy, windy day. There was no power on Elsa and Alex's property as trees had taken nearby power wires down. Elsa was concerned for our safety with trees above the tiny house bending in the wind and suggested we relocate to a hotel, which we did. Elsa and Alex refunded our first night's stay because of the weather and lack of electricity. #goodpeople

We returned the next day and settled in, enjoying the farm animals and outdoor seating area. The tiny house is remarkably spacious and is outfitted with everything we needed to feel at home. It is located close to so many incredible outdoor adventures: Bailey Mountain, Mount Mitchell and all the breathtaking overlooks on the Blue Ridge Parkway, and Chimney Rock SP. Downtown Asheville and incredible restaurants like Mellow Mushroom (pizza) and Tupelo Honey Cafe (best biscuits EVER!) are within a 35 minute drive.

Highly recommend Elsa and Alex's place and Western NC! We'll be back!"
6076,93,"This tiny house is beautiful! We had the best time staying there, and the little town they are in is so cute! It really does feel spacious, and hanging out with Mischka will really make you want to abandon all plans and stay cozy! Elsa and Alex were great hosts, and their home and land was absolutely beautiful and peaceful."
6077,93,"This was our first time staying in a tiny home and it was perfect! Well equipped, great location, and beautiful!"
6078,93,"Beautiful stay in a quiet side street of Burnsville. Elsa & Alex's instructions of parking and entering the residence were easy to follow, and the tiny home looked exactly like the photos but felt more cozy than we expected. The temperature control was perfect, and the heater worked well enough to keep us perfectly toasty in 20 degree weather. It was free of clutter, the interior was beautiful, and it was stocked with pans, spices, and pretty much everything you could need if you wanted to make a meal here, including coffee and creamer in the fridge. The compost toilet was also easy to use, and the bathroom itself was clean and also cozy in itself. Before we left from our stay, we visited with their rabbits, goats, and friendly cat that other guests had mentioned, and it was very peaceful!
It is also worth mentioning that there is an Ingles only 10 minutes away for groceries, and the road leading up the house was not difficult to drive up. This is the perfect home for a peaceful stay."
6079,93,Loved the house!
6080,93,had an amazing time! so beautiful
6081,93,"My first stay at a tiny home, and it was great. It had a good amount of space, and it was a very cozy place. We loved our stay!"
6082,93,"Our stay was nothing but wonderful!! We have stayed in a couple tiny houses around the states and this was by far the best one!! It’s cozy, spacious and (literally) had everything we needed! Elsa was very helpful and responsive. We loved the surroundings and the animals in the farm. Last but not least, Mishka was the absolute perfect co-host! He would come over everyday in the mornings and stay at the time house with us!
We can’t wait to come back!"
6083,93,"Wonderful tiny house on a beautiful property! Very cozy space, and I really enjoyed my stay here!"
6084,93,"Loved the location. Frist time in a tiny home and it was fun and relaxing. We enjoyed our time there and while be back.

Thank you,"
6085,93,This was a last minute one night stay and I was very pleased with my experience. The house had everything that I needed and more.
6086,93,"Loved our stay at this cozy tiny home! The farm animals were adorable and Mischka the cat was the friendliest cat I’ve ever encountered. Would love to return, highly recommend!"
6087,93,Loved the place. Felt so homey. Very comfortable bed too!
6088,93,Elsa and Alex were great hosts. Will definitely book again when I return to the area. They were very responsive - which I value a lot in an airbnb host. The place was beautiful and every item in the home felt intentionally thought out.
6089,93,This is the cutest and coziest tiny home ever. I love my stay and we enjoyed meeting the cat and chickens! I definitely want to come back!!
6090,93,Great place! Very cozy and spacious for being a tiny home.
6091,93,Thank Elsa and Alex for a great stay! We loved our time in your tiny home.
6092,93,The Tiny House was economical and exactly as depicted! Great for a cozy weekend away. Would highly recommend for anyone wanting an overnight or weekend to the Asheville area.
6093,93,"Excellent stay! We arrived during the first snow and Elsa + Alex were incredibly responsive, supportive. I’ve never been to a tiny house so spacious - they did an amazing job with the design and amenities. Wish I stayed longer! Hopefully I can return again."
6094,93,great tiny home. has everything you need
6095,93,Loved this place! Plenty of room for two people to be extremely comfortable. Elsa and Alex were very accommodating.
6096,93,"Elsa and Alex’s tiny home was enjoyable! We only stayed two nights, just for a spot to stay between hiking. The area was peaceful. The chickens and goats were very cute! One thing to note is that the farm house where the hosts live is very close to the tiny home. Before check in, they messaged me with clear instructions of where to park and how to check in, which was great!
The tiny house was adorable. The only downside was the smell in the bathroom. If you are used to a compost toilet, maybe the smell in the bathroom won’t bother you! It was our first experience with a compost toilet so we were in for a treat haha but we just joked about it, and loved the tiny house experience overall."
6097,93,"Excellent location, the house is just as you see it in the pictures. Very detailed instructions and guidelines on how to best enjoy the space made it easy to relax! Very quiet, even with the animals nearby (which btw are adorable and so fun to watch!). I wasn’t too sure about a composting toilet but it’s not at all difficult to use - they provide great instructions! Very responsive hosts, gave us our privacy but quickly took action when we realized we had run out of propane. You can feel the love and attention to details they have poured into this place, and the farm around it. Highly recommend!"
6098,93,"Lovely, as always! Great, peaceful place to stay. :)"
6099,93,"what a awesome place to crash after a long day of tubing!! very cozy my daughter loved the animals!!!
thanks again!!
austin"
6100,93,"This was our second time in the tiny house and it is honestly one of my all-time favorite places to stay. It is such a peaceful and charming location and the tiny house IS surprisingly spacious. Elsa & Alex are great with communication, we ran out of propane at some points but they were super prompt in responding to messages and resolving any concerns. We also loved saying hi to sweet Mischka the cat."
6101,93,"Absolutely would recommend this air b&b. Very clean, easy to find and have a private feeling. The animals were adorable and I love that with permission I was able to pet them! Definitely looking at booking again for my next years Spartan race."
6102,93,Thank goodness for this perfect getaway!
6103,93,Absolutely great tiny home experience! I definitely recommend staying here and I'm sure I'll be back. Everything was perfect.
6104,93,"My daughter and I had a great weekend at the tiny house. The house was very spacious and had everything we needed. We loved the animals and, of course, the cat! —Location was about 25 minutes from Asheville."
6105,93,"This was our first stay in a tiny house, and we both found it very interesting. The location was perfect for our trip to the Mount Mitchell trailhead. The home is well-appointed and nicely decorated."
6106,93,"The location is exactly as the title entails. Plenty of space for a party of two, and plenty of accommodations to keep you comfortable and happy. The bedding is very comfortable, the kitchen has everything you need for a delightful home cooked meal. I cannot recommend staying here enough."
6107,93,"This is exactly as advertised, which was just want I wanted. A sweet space for some quiet time. Check in was seamless, the place was so clean, it had everything I needed and the cat was the best part!"
6108,93,"I highly recommend staying here. It was so peaceful and had everything needed for a comfortable getaway. I especially loved getting to spend some time with the sweetest boy, Mischka!"
6109,93,Elsa and Alex’s tiny home was a wonderful getaway for us. The location and tiny farm were really enjoyable. We visited in late September which was perfect atmosphere!
6110,93,great placeto stay. very clean
6111,93,"This tiny home was super cute, very spacious, and cozy! It’s a very peaceful environment and we loved sitting outside with coffee and at mealtimes. It’s also very close to downtown Burnsville. The animals walking around are a fun added bonus. Everything was clean and stocked, and we didn’t feel like we lacked anything. Would definitely recommend!"
6112,93,"This tiny house was perfect in every way. Easy to find, and the private drive made me feel welcome right away. It’s close to town but away from the noise. I would definitely stay here again. Excellent hosts with great communication."
6113,93,"Very peaceful, rural setting and still easy enough to find with GPS. Perfect for a little get away, & waking up to the noises of chickens and goats is way more relaxing than an alarm! 10/10 would recommend."
6114,93,Very comfy and cozy
6115,93,It was great! Super cute tiny house and amazing hospitality!
6116,93,It's such a lovely place to stay. We're already looking forward to getting to stay here again and for longer hopefully!
6117,93,"The home was incredible. Very clean, beautiful location, and has everything you need. Elsa and Alex were great. Responded quickly and took care of everything before we even needed to ask for it, even opened up the home early for us so we could get ready for a wedding. Definitely will be coming back!"
6118,93,An amazing tiny home! Loved the location and atmosphere! Very cozy and relaxing. Environmentally friendly!
6119,93,"This tiny house is the perfect setting for a quiet retreat. My daughter and I enjoyed our stay! You will, too!"
6120,93,"Elsa and Alex’s tiny home is perfect! Cannot say that enough! Absolutely perfect! It was pristine and clean, very well equipped, very clear instructions, secluded, good wifi, cozy bed, and a nice TV. On top of that, you stay on this beautiful farm and wake up to cute chickens, goats, and cats outside your window. It’s an unbeatable ambiance!"
6121,93,I loved this property. It was in a great location to explore all my hiking excursions. And by far one of the best tiny home designs I’ve stayed in. It has everything you need and then some for a perfect tiny stay. Would definitely book again!
6122,93,"The tiny house was absolutely incredible, and we hope to go back someday! Staying in the tiny house was like staying in a fairytale. Every morning we looked forward to waking up and seeing the goats and chickens outside, and waited patiently for Mischka the cat to show up at our door and come in for snuggles! No detail was missed within this tiny house, and it didn't feel tiny at all! (Even to my 6'3 partner!) The composting toilet was no issue whatsoever, and we appreciated the emphasis on sustainability throughout the tiny house. We also loved the fresh eggs!

We had never been to the Asheville area before, but we will definitely be back! This place felt peaceful and away from busy life, but it didn't feel too secluded/in the middle of nowhere. We spent most of our days hiking off of the Blue Ridge Parkway and finishing in Asheville for dinner. We stayed for 4 nights, and we wish we could have stayed for many more! Thank you so much to Elsa and Alex for a lovely trip, and if you are considering booking this place -- do it!!! :)"
6123,93,Thoughtfully designed tiny house. Accurate and detailed description. Hosts quickly and quietly changed propane tank as soon as I mentioned it. Good location in a beautiful area.
6124,93,Super cute and spacious tiny house. Peaceful country setting. Eco-conscious.
6125,93,"Most beautiful area! Walking up to the sunrise, beautiful green trees, and sounds of nature couldn’t have been more relaxing! The hosts we quick to take care of any issues. Absolutely would stay here again."
6126,93,10/10 stay! Mischka is so cute and friendly and made our stay. We miss him very much. Elsa and Alex are great hosts.
6127,93,"Beautiful little gem located close to the amenities of town! A clean and beautiful place to stay. We enjoyed watching the ducks, chickens and goats from the window and had a very peaceful evening enjoying the space."
6128,93,"We loved this tiny house and the sustainable touches of the hosts! The space was lovely decorated and its location on their little farm was wonderful! Also, several great hikes can be easily reached from there. The best part was the little cat that welcomed us so warmly and repeatedly kept us company during our stay. We would be happy to come back any time!"
6129,93,"The Tiny House, was amazing! I would highly recommend this gem to anyone."
6130,93,we loved this stay! the tiny house was so adorable and just what we needed. we got many visits from the farm animals when we were hanging out outside which was very cool:)
6131,93,"This little place is exceptional!! It's well-placed in a wonderfully peaceful setting where you are surrounded by nature. The animals noted in the description add a fun and special charm. The place is very comfortable for a couple and we loved the simple functionality...motivated us to start talking about doing our own tiny home at some point! Everything was comfortable, easy to find, and only what we needed. Communication was simple and responsive. Great job in every way Elsa and Alex!!"
6132,93,"Elsa and Alex's place is a really lovely ""tiny"" home that is indeed quite spacious, comfortable, and beautifully furnished and appointed with gorgeous dark wood counter tops and light wood wall paneling. It has a real homey feel, a very comfortable bed and loft space as well as a cozy day bed to lounge on (or comfortably sleep on) and enjoy the nature and farm views out the large picture window. The location is peaceful and picturesque, quite convenient to the town of Burnsville, the Blue Ridge Parkway and visiting/hiking beautiful Mount Mitchell. I really loved hearing and seeing the various farm animals and visits from sweet Mischka, the friendly grey cat ambassador! Elsa and Alex were kind and considerate, happy to answer questions or allow for privacy as desired. I was there during a bit of a heat spell so it was a bit hot during the day, but the many fans and opening windows at night cooled down the place pretty well. I really enjoyed my stay and highly recommend this tiny home!"
6133,93,"Elsa and Alex definitely put some big love into this tiny home. The indoor is really clean and cozy (and surprisingly spacious, as described). The outdoor fire pit area was our favorite and a gorgeous way to end the day (keep your eye out for lightning bugs you can catch and release)! Loved the animal neighbors and overall vibe. We’ll be back soon!"
6134,93,This place was amazing. The tiny house was beautiful and clean. The outside was gorgeous and Mischka was an absolute sweetheart.
6135,93,What a hidden gem! Fantastic tiny house and great property to go with it. great price as well! We hope to be back!
6136,93,"This is one of the best. Plenty of space, awesome location, and very clean! I highly recommend it!"
6137,93,"I definitely recommend Elsa and Alex’s tiny home! It looks small on the outside but feels quite sizable on the inside. It wasn’t too difficult to find, and I had everything that I needed while I was there. The hosts left very clear instructions, and I found that their listing was quite accurate compared to the actual house. I wish I could have stayed longer, it looks like there are some nice hiking areas nearby. I stayed by myself, but it would also be a great weekend getaway spot for couples."
6138,93,"What a wonderful, relaxing place to stay! Loved our first tiny house experience. Exactly as described - so charming and clean and quiet. The animals were the cherry on top. We stayed here based on its proximity to the observatory. Close enough to the Blue Ridge Parkway for excursions to Little Switzerland (stop by the cafe and general store), and Crabtree and Grassy Creek waterfalls - both beautiful. Highly recommend!"
6139,93,"Great place! Beautiful, loved all the animals, a perfect weekend in the mountains."
6140,93,"Elsa and Alex has a beautiful property with 2 goats, chickens, ducks, rabbits, and a garden. We thoroughly enjoyed watching the animals and even got to see their escape artist chicken escape its pen!
The tiny house has heating but no AC so during humid days in the mountains the moist air could be a bit uncomfortable. There are plenty of durable, modern windows that roll out and several fans that can provide all the air circulation that you could possibly want.
The compost toilet was a new experience of us and it was clean and easy to use.
The tiny house was very clean and provided us everything we could possibly need. My party of 3 really enjoyed our stay!"
6141,93,"What a gem this place is. The house and the vibe were exceptionally calm and comfortable. I only had one day and night but it rejuvenated me after a long difficult trip.

I would go back to hanker down and relax and work.

Really exceptional. Thanks so much."
6142,93,"A lovely place to stay. A well-crafted dwelling in the middle of a rural, small farm/homestead.
The house has everything you would ever need or want. All the amenities of a regular house with lots of charm and beautiful craftmanship.
A stunning and perfect place to be."
6143,93,It’s a great place to stay if you are in the area. The place is very tiny and clean! Highly recommended
6144,93,"Private. Inspirational. Fun. We love their super friendly cat, Mischka and seeing the efforts to grow their own food and raise animals in a very gorgeous setting."
6145,93,"Yes, I gave it five stars in every area -- but I mean it! This place is magical. Their tiny home is beautiful, cozy, and clean. I was entertained by the ducks, chickens, and goats, and enjoyed the quiet and peacefulness of the area. And Mischka the cat gave me some needed cuddles. I felt like I was in a dream."
6146,93,"Absolutely delightful spot! Just as described, super dreamy surroundings, and cozy place to rest and recover. Highly recommend!"
6147,93,The tiny house is very easy to find and the privacy given feels like you have more than enough space. It was well equipped for the weather as well with kitchen utensils and the essentials! Lovely setting and a great experience.
6148,93,"this is definitely a tiny house in the middle of nowhere! we had everything we needed, great restaurants pretty close. watching the goats, ducks, and chickens in the morning while having a cup of coffee in the chilly morning was more than perfect. 🥰 plenty of hiking to do too!"
6149,93,"Super easy to get to. Convient to town and the highway. The tiny house felt luxurious and spacious! Everything you need and super comfortable. I only stayed one night because I had other commitments. If I didn’t, I would be a super nice retreat for a lot longer!!"
6150,93,Fantastic tiny house on the most fantastic big little farm. We had morning coffee with the deer. By the time we were finishing up the goats were waking up. A wonderful tiny home. It’s meticulously cared for and we loved the story of it once being their primary home. We hope to come again!
6151,93,"Could have not been better! The house was so spacious and had more than we could ask for! All animals were super friendly, especially Mischka the cat🥰"
6152,93,It’s a small space but very well laid out. There is a compost toilet so if you are not use to that you’ll need to make sure you read the instructions. I absolutely loved our stay and would definitely return if staying in the area! I was also THRILLED by the visit from their adorable cat!!!
6153,93,What a lovely stay! Everything was great and clean! The space is very open and we were intrigued by how they fit it all in the tiny space!
6154,93,"This tiny home truly lives up to its name of being spacious. I could not BELIEVE how big it felt for such a small space! It was so clean, functional, cozy, and just felt SO perfect. The kitchen was fully stocked, the bedding was so comfortable, and the atmosphere/personal touches where so home-like. I wish I could have stayed longer! I would absolutely stay here again!"
6155,93,"This tiny house is set among the scenic folds of a quiet mountain where you can watch the sun set with peaceful goats and watch it rise over dewy grass while the ducks waddle around. The thoughtful design of the tiny house makes you feel like you’re in your own private slice of the world. It feels safe, cozy, and ideal. The hosts are incredibly sweet and kind and, if they’re around when you check out, will offer a wave goodbye as you leave the property. Would highly recommend this lovely experience to anyone considering 😊"
6156,93,"Elsa and Alex offer a wonderful stay in a spacious tiny home. Their home was fully stocked with kitchen supplies, games, reading, and everything we needed. The farm was a great experience, and there's plenty of outdoor space & seating to enjoy the company of the goats and their friendly cat. Our only complaint was the composting toilet had an odor. Overall a wonderful experience and a very cozy stay."
6157,93,"Thank you Elsa and Alex! We truly enjoyed our stay in the tiny home. My son instantly fell in love with the sweet cat, goats and chickens. The home was cute and tidy with everything you could need.

We stumbled upon live bluegrass and tasty wood fire pizza at High Hollow just up the road. Burnsville is such a beautiful and special mountain town. Can't wait to return!"
6158,93,It was a quaint and well appointed space!
6159,93,"Elsa and Alex have a great small space. Adequate amenities, great location and animals nearby. The cat was our favorite as he is very friendly. Response time to questions was fast too. We had a very enjoyable stay."
6160,93,"The tiny house was delightful! It is quaint, yet spacious for its footprint. It is well lain out and nicely decorated. The downstairs seating (likely just a twin size mattress) is very comfortable and make a great movie-watching spot. The sleeping loft was great! The low ceiling makes it very cozy, and the king size mattress (this was the selling point for me - I couldn’t find another tiny house with a king size mattress) was a perfect fit. It was an all around delightful experience. And yes, the compost toilet does take some getting used to.

P.S. Mishca, the gray and white cat, wants to become your friend, and is certainly tenacious enough to compel you to let him/her in. If you’re not allergic, and if you don’t mind a little car hair, let Mishca in!"
6161,93,Had a wonderful weekend getaway at this beautiful tiny home!
6162,93,"This is the absolute perfect place to stay if you're looking to be immersed in the beauty of Asheville! The tiny home is about a 30 minute drive from downtown, but the mountains are so beautiful that they make the drive feel like nothing. If you're looking for hiking or beautiful views, the house is also a short drive away from some great overlooks and trails along the Blue Ridge Parkway.

The tiny house lives up to the listing title! I was so surprised at how much space we had , and I got a kick out of climbing the ladders on each side of the house. The kitchen is stocked with any utensils you could need, and all the appliances worked perfectly! The composting toilet was a little intimidating at first, but Elsa and Alex left very clear instructions on how to use it and it's really quite easy and convenient! The animals outside are so sweet and cute, and waking up to all of their sounds makes you feel like you're a character in a storybook. Mischka the cat became one of the highlights of our trip, he would come to say hello and cuddle in the mornings or afternoons when we were in the house! He's one of the sweetest and friendliest cats I have ever met and he really makes you feel at home :)"
6163,93,"This tiny house was even more beautiful and comfortable than we could have ever imagined. It was the most wonderful place my boyfriend and I could have picked for our vacation to the mountains. It was within very reasonable driving distance to hiking trails, scenic overlooks, and even downtown asheville. Every detail of the house was perfectly thought out and made our stay very stress free. Thank you so much Elsa and Alex. We will be recommending for sure !!"
6164,93,Really cute tiny house and very cozy!
6165,94,"Sherry was very responsive, we felt quite privileged to be able to use her house with its amazing views while the seasons were changing. I highly recommend staying here if you need accommodation in the area."
6166,94,Our stay at Sherrie’s Home was a wonderful get away. Everything was as listed on Airbnb. The home was clean and all amenities you would need was available and very spacious. The view is fantastic. Great to star gaze at night it was-a delight to view the lights below at night Sherry was very quick to answer our phone call when we needed her assistance. Deff recommend.
6167,94,Great house
6168,94,Great cabin with great views. Sherry is an excellent host!
6169,94,"Great house, we’ve stayed multiple weeks for work and plan to stay again in the future."
6170,94,Awesome views
6171,94,Great place to stay with a wonderful view. Very relaxing and clean home
6172,94,Another beautiful stay at Sherry’s mountain getaway and it’s a personal favorite! Very cozy and serene :)
6173,94,"Lovely house, we had a wonderful stay, the view was breathe taking every morning. Very peaceful, everything went smoothly."
6174,94,Perfection
6175,94,The views were amazing!!
6176,94,This home is beautiful! The few is also breath taking! We loved staying here for a quick weekly getaway. I beautiful view that makes you feel like you’re way up in the mountains. The home was very clean and had everything we needed. The beds are very comfortable and clean! I loved the flat and fluffy pillow option. Would love to come here during spring/ summer to enjoy the porch and view more. I would recommend this to anyone wanting a night or weekend away.
6177,94,"Sherry’s place was perfect for our needs! We would have loved to stay longer. The night time view of cities lights and the moon were great as well! Kitchen was well stocked, best I’ve seen! Beds were comfortable and sheets soft. Perfect for our party of 4."
6178,94,The view was more beautiful than pictures could ever show. The place itself was lovely. My family and I stayed for a few nights and loved it. Highly recommend.
6179,94,"Definitely best place I had at all , best and wonderful view , all clan , answer all massages on time and pretty respectful, early check in, i just want to say thank you so much 😊"
6180,94,"If I could give this place more than 5 stars I would! The home is beautiful & cozy and the location is perfect. The house is tucked away so you feel like you’re lost in the mountains, but it’s only about 5 minutes to the highway so it offers much quicker access to the surrounding towns compared to other Airbnbs. Sherry recommended many places that would pique our interest and she was incredibly accommodating. I’m so pleased that we chose this lovely mountain home as our first Airbnb experience."
6181,94,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay! The view itself was amazing, and took my breath away. Sherry was very helpful and even recommended a few local places to visit. We loved the “home-y” feel of Valdese. We will definitely return!"
6182,94,"Sherry was a wonderful host. She was easy to communicate with before and during our stay. The house was clean, and just the perfect size for our family. And that veiw was amazing. We would definitely stay at the property again."
6183,94,Beautiful place with a fantastic view. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and will likely book again.
6184,94,The cabin was very clean and looks like it was recently remodeled. We enjoyed our stay and the location is great for making day trips to several of the sights in the area.
6185,94,"Absolutely adorable house with an amazing view. The house had anything we could have asked for, plus very convenient location for multiple cities and towns. 10/10 would stay again!"
6186,94,"Beautiful home. Everything is clean and in a perfect place. Kitchen was fully stocked with everything we needed. It was clean upon check-in. The deck is a beautiful space although we wished for a bit more solitude as the home sits within ear distance of I-40 but that's a personal preference. We loved the area, so much less crowded than Asheville but a short drive for our adventures to South Mountain, Grandfather Mountain, a day trip to Asheville and Morganton. We would stay here again."
6187,94,Everything was as described. View from cabin was beautiful. Cleanest unit we have ever rented. Would definitely rent again.
6188,94,We had a wonderful stay at the rustic retreat. The cabin was so clean and had everything we needed. Thank you for sharing your place with us!
6189,94,Absolutely an amazing stay. View was incredible. Recommend to anyone
6190,94,Sherry was very attentive and helpful. The home was clean and all the description were perfect. Would love to come back.
6191,94,"Sherry was quick to communicate and easy to work with. The kitchen was well stocked, and the view was great!"
6192,94,"Sheet had great communication regarding the stay. The cab is clean, well-equipped and nicely decorated. The deck offers a beautiful view!"
6193,94,"Quiet, comfortable house with a phenominal view. Waking up to that biew was the best prt af every day!"
6194,94,Calming visit and beautiful views. House was clean and well taken care of. Would highly recommend!
6195,94,Wasn’t the first time staying here and won’t be the last! The view alone is worth getting this place! Sherry is an awesome host
6196,94,Beautiful location. Very clean. Driveway is a little sketchy but nothing to really complain about. Great stay overall.
6197,94,"Amazing place, awesome views, great host. Plan to stay for at least 4-5 days to get the best out of this place."
6198,94,Nice view!
6199,94,"Home is in a great location, close to many areas."
6200,94,"Super clean, beautiful airbnb with breathtaking views. It was such a peaceful stay seeing the sky + the shape of the mountains change colors throughout the day and into the evening. Even the hot water/water pressure in the shower was heaven. Wifi is fast. The place is decorated so lovely. Sherry was an outstanding host. Very sweet and communicative. We wouldn't hesitate to stay at this airbnb again next time we're in town! Thank you, Sherry!"
6201,94,"Super great views, clean and neat layout. The upstairs attic bedroom is awesome for kids (who can climb easy ladders). The downstairs gave us privacy why the kids enjoyed their clubhouse.

If you come here for work you may not get much done. Because you’ll just sit on the balcony and relax!!"
6202,94,"Beautiful spot, cozy home, nice location between Hickory and Morganton, and awesome views

We hope to have the opportunity to visit again. Highly recommend"
6203,94,"Great little place up in the mountains. Close enough to everything we needed. Golfed, grilled, and watched baseball."
6204,94,Don’t let the word “rustic” throw you off! This is a modern and well-kept property! Sherry was an excellent host and checkin/checkout was easy peasy. We had such a great time on the porch watching the birds flying so close by and enjoying the beautiful view of thunderstorms from inside the house. We will definitely be back!
6205,94,"All of the reviews are true—this place is AMAZING!!! The photos do not do this stunning home justice. The views are unbelievable and we were lucky enough to see fireworks every night for the 4th of July. It was truly an incredible sight. The house itself is well-appointed, comfortable, and offers everything you need for a wonderful vacation in the mountains. It's perfect for couples, families, or just a getaway for two. Plus, it's in an ideal location close to I-40 and just 10-30 minutes or less to gas, food, hiking, waterfalls, and more. However, we found that we most enjoyed staying at the house and lounging on the deck overlooking the mountains. With a view like that, there's really no reason to leave! If you do venture out though, McGalliard Falls Park (10 min away) is a great place to go to see a lovely waterfall with a fun swimming area. South Mountains State Park (25-30 min away) is also a nice destination not far from the house with waterfalls, swimming, and plenty of hiking trails. Sherry was an excellent host—very informative, communicative, and quick to respond when we needed anything. Book this place NOW—I promise you won't regret it!!! We will DEFINITELY be back in the future!"
6206,94,Quiet place! Awesome view!!!
6207,94,"A peaceful, private stay~
Sherry was the perfect hostess, stayed in the background, yet completely available and she checked in on us va text to be sure we had what we e needed. We did. The kitchen was wonderfully stocked with equipment making the kitchen as “Down Home” as could be.
We had more room than we needed.

Downstairs was nice though we didn’t use it….a whole additional private space with bathroom. And it was so convenient to have the washer/dryer. I didn’t mention the loft because we didn’t go up but there are beds there too. Just as described!

I can’t say enough about the generous sized deck, table, chairs, etc. for spectacular views and with trees on the side, we had a refreshing breeze most of the time.
Thank you, Sherry, for creating such a welcoming place!"
6208,94,My boyfriend and I loved our stay here. The view and home was beautiful and spacious. As well as everything from check in and check out was easy and seamless.
6209,94,"Sherry’s mountain home 🏡 was an absolute pleasure to live, cook, lounge and sleep in. A large amount of the finishes are of great quality and the fit and finish in the kitchen and both restrooms was impeccable, the craftsmen touches are a work of art. The lower level bedroom is the best bedroom to sleep in if you enjoy a cool and dark bedroom (which I love). The home A/C works wonderful and the home was extremely comfortable during the the South’s high heat of summer. When it came to cooking and meal prepping, the kitchen is fully stocked and they have anything and everything one may need to create wonderful meals. Sherry was very clear and polite with all and any communication, and the home’s cleanliness has been by far the best I have experienced in all my airBnB journeys. Once again I will greatly encourage anyone to book Sherry’s Mountain home."
6210,94,Sherry was an excellent host and answered any questions we had. the house was very very clean and had everything we needed. An amazing view! We were very happy with our choice to stay here.
6211,94,"The cabin has stunning views. Sherry is very response, and the cabin is super clean. One bedroom is downstairs, and stairs a bit steep. Fine for our 13 year old. :)"
6212,94,This place was what we needed. Quiet and peaceful. The two floors was a great surprise. The pictures don’t do it justice.
6213,94,"The pictures of the mountain view do not do this place justice. It was incredibly beautiful! Nice long deck with rocking chairs for enjoying the scenery. Also a table and chairs seating 6 for outdoor dining. Parking was pretty easy for getting in and out. We had an Elaborate that could turn around easily. Our son had a midsized SUV that was a little more difficult to turn around but not impossible. Inside the host had decorated very nicely. Beds were very comfortable. Bath upstairs has a tub shower. Bath downstairs has a smallish shower. we're small people so it was fine but a large person would have difficulty in the downstairs shower. The heat and air is a minisplit both up and downstairs. Because of this, the bedroom doors had to be open at night so you don't get too hot or cold depending upon the time of year. The kitchen is small but very well equipped with cooking utensils and dishes. There was almost no sugar salt or pepper and no plastic wrap or tin foil so you should bring your own. there was plenty of coffee and tea. We enjoyed having 2 living rooms one up and one downstairs with their own TV. The location was also spot on because its very close to I40, about 5 minutes. And an easy quick drive to Valdese. Some of the easiest mountain roads to drive on to and from the house. The driveway to to the house is shared with 2 other homes but this was never a traffic issue for us. The home was extremely clean inside, one of the cleanest we've stayed in. The furniture outside had to be cleaned before we could use it. Cleaning supplies are provided. Sherry was easy to communicate with. We would definitely stay here again. Its perfect for 2 adult couples which is what our party was."
6214,94,"Very clean, cozy cabin. Everything was just perfect. Well deserved 5 stars!"
6215,94,"a truly wonderful Airbnb with an amazing view of the blue ridge mountains! Clean and tidy, Sherry’s home was lovely!"
6216,94,"There's a beautiful view all hours of the day! Great host and communication. Kitchen doesn't have a wide variety of seasonings, but it does have every utensil and cookware item you can think of.

I recommend traveling to Morganton to eat at The Town Tavern. They have riverside seating :)"
6217,94,"Wow! this place is Amazing!! The view from the balcony is incredible. Inside the house is very cozy, big and comfortable. The kitchen have everything you need. Good communications with the owner. Recommend 100%."
6218,94,"We loved our stay here! It feels like you’ve gotten the keys to a close friends house, and you have all you need to enjoy your weekend getaway. My cleaning standards are relatively high, and this stay impressed me with the amount of care that’s been put into maintaining the house. It’s charming, inviting, and overall well accommodating and we found everything we needed to have a great stay within the premises."
6219,94,"We loved our stay in Valdese at the Mineral Springs Mountain Retreat. The location was perfect...it was close to the interstate, and close to many dining options. The cabin was very clean and cozy. It overlooked the mountains and the town and the view was stunning. The hostess was a wonderful communicator and was very available to assist us with the booking process. We recommend Sherry and her quiet retreat."
6220,94,"I really enjoyed staying here for a long weekend. It is hard to find a place for a single person that is nice and is not overpriced but this was definitely an affordable stay. Sherry gave tons of suggestions before my stay and responded within minutes whenever I needed to get in contact with her. Her place is very clean and feels just like home. The bed is comfortable, there is everything you will need in the kitchen including coffee, and plenty of room if multiple people stayed. The view is incredible during the day and even at night. There is a lot of seating outside and there is also a small grill with charcoal provided. There are cabins/houses nearby, but there were no noise issues at all it was like they were not even there. You certainly cannot go wrong staying here! To note: I read some comments about the driveway being steep, but it is easily accessible with 2wd as I have a Camaro. The driveway is very narrow, and it is not easy to turn a vehicle around so keep that in mind. The upstairs TV does not have many options, but the downstairs TV has plenty of options including Hulu, Netflix, YouTube, etc."
6221,94,"Cute as a button, neat as a pin! This adorable home sits perched on the hillside with the most mesmerizing views. Two bedroom suites, one up, one down and a pair of twin beds in the loft gives plenty of sleeping space. There are two separate areas to relax, a cozy living room and kitchen/dining on the main floor and another living area downstairs, both with large TVs, downstairs with a fireplace. There's a washer/dryer downstairs too. A huge wrap-around porch is perfect for outdoor activities. Once you navigate the steep narrow driveway, the home is an ideal vacation retreat. Sherry was an awesome host!"
6222,94,Great place to stay. The view is amazing! The pictures don't do it justice! The location is very convenient. Awesome hiking trails at South Mountain State Park! Easy day trip to Asheville or Charlotte. Easy access to drive the blu ridge parkway. Grandfather mountain and Mt. Mitchell are both about an hour drive. Nice towns close by. We went to Hickory motor speedway for a race! JD's smokehouse and Old world baking company were great places to eat nearby. We would come back!
6223,94,The house and location was awesome! Highly recommend!
6224,94,"We really enjoyed ourselves definitely want to do this again we really enjoyed the mountains like the view was everything!! 🥰🥰🥰
Mom Star/I was surprised with this Trip from my two oldest 18 & 20 They blew me away with this first trip,To the owner Your cabin was an awesome experience I personally thank you!!"
6225,94,Beautiful place with beautiful scenery!!
6226,94,This place is so much better in person than it presents in pictures.
6227,94,"The best way to wake up and go to sleep; with this wonderful view! Sherry's place was so cozy for a mountain retreat with my fiance!
Sherry thinks of everything, between extra blankets in every room, extra toiletries in the showers, fully shocked kitchen of utensils and appliances, and a few games/ DVD. Just a note, the steps in the home are a bit narrow.
Overall, this place is a gem!"
6228,94,Wonderful retreat in the mountains! I loved this home and the location was perfect. It was quiet and very comfortable. Will definitely be back!
6229,94,"Beautiful location, great views and a comfortable, cosy cottage. Perfect for a quiet getaway."
6230,94,"Very nice, clean cabin with updated kitchen, furniture, and decor! The view is beautiful during the day and at night with all the lights in the distance. There is a constant hum from the traffic which is relaxing.
The cabin is close to town and the main highway. The driveway is steep and narrow but we did just fine with a 2WD.
There are neighbors nearby, so the only true privacy you have is on the back porch and inside the cabin.
I can't say enough good things about the host! She is friendly, helpful, flexible, and understanding. :)"
6231,94,"We had a wonderful time at Sherry's place! it's perfectly decorated, clean and comfortable. 10 minutes from downtown Valdese with shops & restaurants. Hope to stay there again!"
6232,94,This was a beautiful space with amazing views and everything you needed to have a pleasant stay. We enjoyed traveling to South mountain state park and also eating at Two Brothers pizza in Valdese
6233,94,"Amazing cabin, awesome view!! Super clean, great location. Sherry is a great host and the communication was fantastic. I recommend this property 💯!! You’re not going to regret it. We enjoy every part or this beautiful place."
6234,94,"From the moment we got there we were in awe. The pictures just don't do this place justice. The views are spectacular, insane, awesome, wonderful, amazing (you get the idea). The house has everything you need for a quiet, peaceful getaway. Very clean, and well appointed. We wish we could have spent more time there. We will be back for sure."
6235,94,The view was beyond beautiful and the house was very clean and lovely. My friends and I enjoyed every moment of our stay and left feeling renewed and at peace.
6236,94,Loved the stay!!
6237,94,"From the moment we pulled up to the airbnb we were in love! The key was easy to find and host sent code well ahead of our arrival. The house was immaculately clean when we got there and was even decorated for Christmas. The porch has a spectacular view of the mountains and was where we spent a lot of our stay during the unseasonably warm December visit. So many different types of birds to watch!
The kitchen is well stocked, there's mixing bowls, measuring cups, measuring spoons. They even had a crockpot, griddle, and electric skillet and that's on top of the beautiful electric stove. We forgot flour and almost ruined breakfast but we were happy to find there was already some stocked in the kitchen along with some spices, salt and pepper.
The main floor bedroom/bathroom had a very comfy bed and a built in space heater in the bathroom which felt really luxurious. Plenty of clean towels and washcloths too!
When inside we stayed mostly in the basement which had a little fireplace heater that kept the place very cozy.
We didn't sleep in the basement bedroom or loft but both looked very comfortable.
Overall 10/10, would definitely love to come back in spring!"
6238,94,Awesome cabin with beautiful views! Everything was very clean and tidy that had everything we needed for a weekend stay.
6239,94,"Spectacular view of mountains. Clean, quiet and cozy house with everything you need for a nice stay. Host easily available and pleasant to deal with."
6240,94,This was the second time we stayed here. The cabin was very clean and comfortable. The kitchen is small but very well stocked with everything you need to cook breakfast or dinner. The views are amazing and only minutes away from Valdese and Morganton. Nice restaurants and breweries close by.
6241,94,"Wonderful cabin perfect for romantic getaways, small family reunions, to catch up with friends, or just get away from it all and kick back, hike, read, watch a movie… We really enjoyed our stay and will likely come back. Super cozy place all around and the view is absolutely amazing. The photos don’t do it justice. Also an easy drive to Asheville and Charlotte."
6242,94,"Our stay was awesome, house was very clean and cozy. we had no problems getting there or checking in, Conveniently located near food and grocery stores."
6243,94,"This was our first experience with airbnb and what an amazing one it was. From day one Sherry was so hospitable and communicative. We felt like we were being taken care of the whole time. The views are stunning and the home cozy, but it's Sherry that really makes the experience something we've cherished."
6244,94,Absolutely lovely place!!! Exactly like the pictures but better. Views are beautiful and house so comfortable. Will definitely rent again. You want go wrong picking Sherry’s place. Great host!!!!!
6245,94,We had a very romantic stay at this beautiful location. Sherry was very responsive and the house was not located too far off road so it was easily accessible while also getting the entire mountain experience.
6246,94,"Beautiful home. Very clean. Nice quiet neighborhood. The host was very easy to communicate with and offered suggestions about the local surroundings. The was exactly what I expected from the listing, and I would recommend this home and this host to anyone."
6247,94,Very nice cabin! We especially enjoyed the rocking chairs on the back deck overlooking the lovely view. Sherry worked with us to allow us to check in a little early.
6248,94,"Cute, adorable amazing little cottage with an awesome view! Sherry was a great communicator. Didn't want to return to reality 😊"
6249,94,Amazing experience once again at Sherry’s adorable home !! The views are just amazing and spent most of the time on the porch. The Mexican restaurant in town is very good and also 100 Main restaurant. We love our get aways there and Sherry is the best hostess ever goes above and beyond!! Cannot wait for next time !!!
6250,94,"Gorgeous home with beautiful views
Sherry was great with communicating and checking in on us.
Everything about the stay was fantastic"
6251,94,"Excellent, extremely clean & cozy private cabin. It was very well furnished, & I highly enjoyed my time there."
6252,94,AMAZING VIEWS!! My husband and I had a amazing time. Communication with our host was fast and easy. The house is stunning with breathtaking views. Very very clean home. Will definitely be coming back.
6253,94,"We unfortunately could not make it to visit the cabin. However, Sherry was excellent with communication and very understanding. We definately hope to try again!"
6254,94,"I took a last minute stay here for to focus on work. It was an amazing experience with great views of Burke County. I never knew the views could get that great and and I didn’t have to take the time to drive out to the mountains (Boone, etc…). I would definitely rent again if I came back to the area."
6255,94,Beautiful home with amazing views. Very relaxing getaway.
6256,95,The home was conviently located but surprisingly private. Surrounded by trees on all sides and off a quiet road. Inside was remarkable. The simple white and open space maximized the foot print which made it a very comfortable stay . Every detail was carefully considered and well placed. We had a great time here and my family didn't want to leave.
6257,95,"delightful, private, clean accommodations. Perfect for the occasion, Laura was timely with responses, a generous host"
6258,95,"Rocky Knoll Hideaway was everything I could want in my own home let alone a perfect vacation retreat! We felt very welcome in the space. Laura provided snacks, smores, and the little addition of bedside candy dishes was so sweet. The decor was spot on and beautiful. The peace of the surrounding area was uncomparable. The privacy of the wooded lot was just right - even in winter/early Spring without leaves on the trees. I can't recommend Laura's rental enough if you just want to enjoy a homey feel away from home. It's not far from the interstate or restaurant/grocery options. Overall, we loved this place!"
6259,95,"UNREAL. Worth every penny. Besides the house being absolutely beautiful and decorated so peaceful and calming, it was immaculately clean, had everything you could think of and has the comfiest beds of any rental we’ve ever stayed. We could not find one single thing that we would change or that we needed, and that blew us away!! We stayed for a relaxing moms-wkd-away and after a visit to a local winery and a stop by the grocery store for essentials on Friday afternoon we ended up not even leaving the cottage! Their hospitality was top notch, the instructions left on the fridge provide everything you need to know and the reclining chairs were comfy enough to stay in literally all day. For those wanting to get out and explore 801 southern kitchen is THE PLACE TO EAT for breakfast/lunch and there was a ton of options around Bermuda Run area. Also so many wineries within 15 minutes. We loved how secluded it felt and cannot wait to come back for a couples stay!"
6260,95,"Laura’s cabin was just as described in her listing, but better. Great layout for two of us. Amenities were well-thought out and above what you would find at a typical listing. The small touches were appreciated; I wish it wasn’t raining, as the fire pit and s’mores were so tempting. Nothing rundown; all seemed very new. Laura was super responsive to messages and was gracious enough to help me back in after checkout for some forgotten items. Will look to rent this location any time I’m back in the area."
6261,95,This cottage is absolutely amazing! Peaceful setting but still a short drive to town and cities. Would highly recommend and will stay here again the next time I’m in the area.
6262,95,"Extremely clean, relaxing, comfortable, bright, and enjoyable. Greatly enjoyed our time here."
6263,95,Wish I could stay longer. Thank you for having such a great place!
6264,95,"Simply a magnificent place. Spotless, beautiful, and extremely relaxing. Very private and quiet setting. I've stayed at many airbnbs and this one was my favorite. I highly recommend this place. Well done."
6265,95,Great home spacious and located in a quiet area.
6266,95,"This place was perfect for a night get-away! Beautifully built/renovated, accommodating, so clean and peaceful."
6267,95,Beautiful place
6268,95,Perfect place for a weekend getaway.
6269,95,"Again the cottage was absolutely AMAZING!!! Beautiful cottage, all the items you may have forgotten provided. Clean, cozy home with beautiful woodsy views. I love the peace and serenity of this cottage."
6270,95,"Beautiful, immaculate house in lovely surroundings."
6271,95,"Absolutely charming little cottage, would definitely recommend."
6272,95,"It was a wonderful stay! A cozy come with all the amenities you could need. There was a nice little platter of snacks, and a bottle of wine. The beds were so comfy. And a wonderful shower!"
6273,95,"This little house is a pristine little getaway. Beautifully decorated, extremely clean and tidy and peaceful surroundings. The host has thought of everything and has the best little touches all around the house. Highly recommend!"
6274,95,"We adored this Airbnb! I loved all the thoughtful little touches Laura has put into this cozy home. Especially the Christmas tree idea since our stay was during Christmas. The fire pit out back was great! My children loved running around outside and we loved the private, yet convenient location. Laura’s place has everything you could need and we look forward to visiting again in the future!"
6275,95,"We rented this Air Bnb as a get away spot for my husband and I following a deployment, and it did not disappoint. If you're looking for a great staycation- this is it.

The house was pristine clean, Laura went out of her way to decorate for christmas, and there was plenty of amenities such as a s'mores bar, coffee/tea and creamer, small candys, that were so generous to offer.

The beds were VERY comfortable and while we wanted a stay cation in the knolwood house, we didn't have much option after catching a cold our second morning there. Having the TVs in the room, with a firestick meant we could rest in bed, comfortably, and binge watch tv like before we had kids.

The one slight downfall can be the lack of delivery options. We could get Instacart, and we were able to Door Dash as well but the options were slim based on the house location which was easily overcome when you see the privacy you get

We can't wait to stay again!"
6276,95,"Cozy cabin in the woods. My adulting children and I had a relaxing wonderful stay. We actually spent Thanksgiving there and had ample space to cook and the kitchen was well stocked. We loved the fire pit out back! We played bored games, relaxed and enjoyed the lovely space. We took several walks at Tanglewood park. There is a lot to do there. My daughter and I wanted to do a horse trail ride but they didn’t have any openings. It’s a peaceful country setting but close to stores and restaurants if needed. Wonderful place to stay. Very neat and clean…we would definitely stay there again."
6277,95,Absolutely BEAUTIFUL place! Would 10/10 recommend to anyone! Will definitely stay here again. Laura is sweet and responsive. A wonderful host!
6278,95,"Perfect accommodations, comfy and cozy in the woods. Everything you need for a home away from home. Impeccably clean, with so many special touches. Highly recommend!"
6279,95,"This place is AirBnB perfection ! Clean, comfortable, spacious, and with little touches to make you feel at home.
Not to forget the frendly hosts...We could not have asked for more. My only regret is that our stay was too brief. We hope to be back again soon. (Can I give it 6 out of 5 stars?)"
6280,95,"Our stay at Laura’s home was exactly what we needed. It’s a cozy cabin, nestled in a beautiful wooded area with all of the necessities (and some extra goodies) for a peaceful getaway."
6281,95,Such a cute little cottage! Great location and very clean!! We very much enjoyed our stay!
6282,95,We had a change of plans for our overnight stay..we were unable to stay as planned and we’re past the point of refund. A day later Laura checked on us to see if all was ok because she personally realized we hadn’t shown up..she refunded us our cleaning fee without any conversation. Thanks Laura for being a professional.
6283,95,"We absolutely loved our stay at this house. We came into town for a wedding and was pleasantly surprised by this house. Laura was very welcoming and accommodating. We very much appreciated all the attention to details; from the personal hand-written note, to snacks and s’mores on the counter, to fire starters and wood for the bonfire, and drinks in the fridge.

The house was in a lovely neighborhood; we felt safe and secure staying here. I’d recommend this place to anyone that’s in town. 10/10"
6284,95,Wonderful place to stay. So clean and cute with fire pit so you can be outside and enjoy the woods around it. Highly recommend!
6285,95,Beautiful little cottage in the woods!
6286,95,"The house was beautiful and so peaceful in the woods. Also, the host was very accommodating. This was one of our favorite Airbnb houses!"
6287,95,"Laura and Matt’s home was well appointed, very clean, and had amazing thoughtful touches (fresh cut flowers, snacks, s’mores, wine, and a personal note!). Highly recommend!"
6288,95,"Possibly the nicest, cleanest Airbnb I’ve ever visited. The house was beautiful, made even more beautiful by the setting. The hosts were also super kind and welcoming through all of our communication. Can’t recommend this place highly enough!"
6289,95,Lovely home. Recommend! 10 out of 10. Ditto to the previous 5star reviews...
6290,95,The best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in!! Extremely well equipped with everything we needed and more. Excellent hosts!
6291,95,Beautiful cabin in the woods. The house and property are lovely and well maintained. Exactly as described and perfect for few days. Nice attention to detail.
6292,95,"This house is brand new and was extremely clean when we arrived. The owners have spent a lot of time and effort to create a great Airbnb experience. It is very nicely decorated and has comfortable furniture. The new foam mattresses and high-quality bedding assure a great night sleep. The house is surrounded by forest, the crickets and sicadas provides cozy sound in the summer night. We spent one night in early September and we are planning to come back once again in the soon future. We give this five stars!"
6293,95,"We were shocked
by the level of care and detail in this stay…everything we could have considered was thoughtfully taken care of. Laura has created an incredibly cozy and quiet stay that far exceeded any expectations we may have had. Incredible. Thank you for a wonderful home away from home experience!"
6294,95,What a beautiful place!! All the small touches really make it feel like home. The hosts went above and beyond to provide a great space.
6295,95,"Laura is a to notch super host, all of the little touches from fresh flowers, a welcome note, wine & chocolates are a few if the little details that make you feel at ""home."" We will definitely stay here again."
6296,95,"We had an amazing stay. Laura was very responsive, and has really thought of every detail. So often when you rent a place as soon as you get unloaded you must rush to the grocery store, not here, Laura had bottle waters, sodas, a bottle of wine, chips, coffee, even a little kit for s’mores and that is just to mention a few. The house was so clean we felt like we were the first guest to ever stay. The bed (we only used one room) was so comfy, we slept great. The house was exactly as described and will be back for sure. There is not one thing that I can even think of that needs improvement. Thank you so much Laura for a wonderful stay!!!"
6297,95,Laura was an amazing host and was really great at communicating. All the little touches throughout the property were perfect. one of the best Airbnb properties we have stayed in the United States!
6298,95,We highly recommend staying at the little house by the woods! Laura is a great hostess!
6299,95,This is a superior value. Updated decorating and very clean. Many thoughtful extras placed throughout the home. You will be glad you rented this place!
6300,95,This is the nicest Airbnb I have ever stayed in. The house was welcoming and just made you feel at ease as soon as you walked in the door. My favorite little detail was the light switches. Each one was labeled so there was no confusion. Small details like that really sold this house as a “come and relax” destination. We loved the easy check out process.
6301,95,All of the little things you did made the getaway even better . It was like staying in a luxury siute in the middle of the woods . You really have a great place. We will be back for our next escape!
6302,95,"Great place and great host. Away from it all, but within a short drive of anything you might need. Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting the area."
6303,95,awesome quiet place! all ya need is here! very quiet. very clean! highly recommend .
6304,95,This is a beautiful ana quaint little cottage. Highly recommended. Great place for a quiet getaway. Wonderful hosts.
6305,95,"This is the most adorable house. Laura thought of everything to make our visit the best. Great attention to details. Even the fire pit was ready. The only thing we had to do was light the fire. Snacks, water, wine, coffee….she thought of it all. The perfect place to stay when visiting the Yadkin Valley."
6306,95,"Super gorgeous nice new cottage! We loved everything about the house but especially the back porch fire pit area. Super clean, super welcoming and comfy. So many special touches that made you feel like someone’s family coming to stay! Laura was so easy to work with!!! We would for sure stay again!"
6307,95,A wonderful get away. The owners think of yhe little things that others don't. You can't go wrong choosing this place.
6308,95,"A perfect little getaway off the beaten path. All of the comforts of home in a lovely, quiet hamlet in the woods. Hosts are generous and accommodating. Only minutes from the city, yet couldn't feel further removed. Do yourself a favor and visit the local winery. (The hosts were kind enough to include a bottle)."
6309,95,We loved this little cottage nestled in the woods! Laura thought of everything we could possibly need during our stay. It is well appointed and just the right size for a family of four. It has a feel of being off the beaten path but is close to restaurants and gas stations. We enjoyed morning coffee on the front patio/porch but didn’t get a chance to relax by the fire pit …… next time!
6310,95,Laura’s place perfect for our getaway. It was very clean and provided the most comfortable stay. Sitting in the backyard listing to the birds while enjoying a glass of wine was relaxing. We highly recommend staying here and look forward to returning soon!
6311,95,"The most amazing AirBnB I have ever stayed at! Laura is an amazing host who thinks of any possible thing you could need she has prepared for it. This house was absolutely beautiful and on a very quiet road. The beds are very comfortable, and when you walk in it instantly feels like home. Definitely will be back to this amazing home!"
6312,95,"This place was BEAUTIFUL. We had the pleasure of being their first guests and they did not disappoint. The house made us feel like we were at home. It was perfect. Very secluded and quiet but not far from town, great location. Laura and Matthew were great hosts and made sure we had everything we needed, including snacks and drinks. We will definitely stay here again. Highly recommended!!"
6313,96,"Great spot, beautiful water."
6314,96,"What a gem! Mark’s cabin was perfectly tucked into the woods and couldn’t be closer to the beautiful flowing creek. The movie library was great! Murphy is a 20-25 minute drive and had some really cute shops. We had a nice meal at Legends Steakhouse too. Mark was always responsive and helped make our stay very enjoyable. Thank you, Mark! We will be back!"
6315,96,"Fantastic stay. If you're looking to get away from the craziness of everyday life, then Mark's spot is the perfect place to unwind. The stream rushing by is the perfect background noise. So cozy and comfortable."
6316,96,"My husband and I enjoyed our very peaceful stay at this cabin. Private, clean, and the owner was easy to communicate with. Overall a wonderful stay!"
6317,96,we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Ferns Hollow. it was quiet and beautiful and Mark was very responsive.
6318,96,"Very nice cabin in beautiful, restful setting near a brook....would definitely return......"
6319,96,"The cabin snuggled down in a valley is right next to a active stream/creek that was absolutely gorgeous to watch and listen too.
In addition we arrived just in time before about 4-6” of snow.

Typical mountain cabin with a newer design shower, lots of outdoor light at night."
6320,96,Little weekend get away for me and my wife best place we have stayed
6321,96,It is a quiet quaint cabin in the woods. Enjoyed mostly indoors because of the rain the weekend we where there. It was exactly what we needed and asked for. Will return after researching the open Tellico OHV roads. This is an absolute gorgeous part of the state!
6322,96,It was exactly what our family needed. The cabin was just as it was described. The river right next to the front porch made this place so peaceful. We definitely will be returning to this cabin.
6323,96,The cabin was beautiful and exactly what we wanted for our stay. The location was perfectly secluded but easy to find. The proximity to the creek was maybe our favorite part. Mark put up a few nice Christmas decorations to add to the aesthetic. The propane fireplace made the space cozy and was much easier than a wood burning fireplace. The kitchen was well equipped. Nearby Murphy had plenty of useful amenities. We LOVED our stay there and would really enjoy a chance to go in the summer. Thanks Mark!
6324,96,"Fern Hollow is a very clean, tidy and well built cabin in a magical setting right on a babbling creek. We stayed 2 nights at the end of October 2022 and the foliage was bursting with colors. Do yourself a favor and take a left out of the driveway and drive appx 9 miles to the TN border and the ‘State Line Campground’ (vault toilets there). The hard-packed gravel road was easy to navigate in our sedan without AWD and lots of places to turn around for a normal sized car/truck despite the daunting sign as you leave pavement at the start of your adventure. The views were incredible - some of the best fall foliage I’ve ever seen. With so many rhododendrons in the forest
I think the spring bloom time would be excellent too. There is a waterfall on your left about 1.5 miles into the drive.

At the cabin, the creek was so nice to listen to. Buy firewood for the fire pit in Murphy since the wood around the cabin may be wet. We wish we could have stayed longer to linger. So much to do in the area, and just chilling on the porch rocking chairs would be sweet if we had enough time.

The Hanging Dog Mercantile you pass on the road to the cabin had live music on a Wednesday night, which was such a happy discovery. Not sure they do that on the regular. They don’t sell beer but are happy for you to bring your own to enjoy as you listen to the band. Our trip couldn’t have been better.

Mark’s check in and check out instructions were very detailed and the cabin was stocked better than expected. We would definitely stay here again."
6325,96,"Fern Hollow is a beautiful cabin set in a peaceful location. Mark, the owner, goes out of the way to make your stay as enjoyable as possible."
6326,96,"Mark's cabin was absolutely amazing! The property is beautiful and the cabin is very clean, spacious, and well stocked. Outside, we enjoyed sitting on the porch listening to the water, fishing, playing football, having campfires, & eating smores (thanks to Mark). Inside we had plenty of room to cook, eat dinner as a family, and play board games while enjoying the fireplace. The location was also perfect. We went to Amicalola Falls State Park; Leatherwood Falls; Deep Creek & The Road to Nowhere (both in Smoky Mountain Nat'l Park) while visiting. Mark was great with communicating every step of the way! I would highly recommend staying at this cabin!"
6327,96,This is an awesome place to stay and just reset into nature. The creek is so calming and the cabin is everything you could want and more. Mark has made this cabin super welcoming with all the little touches. The beds were super comfy and the shower had the best water pressure and hot water! The town is about 20 minutes away and it's so cute and friendly.
6328,96,"We loved everything about this cabin! It was the perfect weekend getaway spot for our family and dog. We enjoyed the fall weather, creek, and fire pit. Mark is an excellent host and communicator, and he ensured everything was OK when we checked in. We will be back."
6329,96,"Anyone looking for a restful retreat will love FernHollow. The cabin is neat, clean and has all you need. Just bring your food and toothbrush. You can even bring your well behaved family pet! Mark your host will walk you through the tv, Wi-Fi, and cabin key lock box. We loved staying at FernHollow and look forward to our next visit."
6330,96,Amazing place for weekend getaway.
6331,96,"Thank you for such a beautiful and peaceful stay. I would recommend to anyone needing some peace and quiet. The cabin, stream and surroundings were amazing. Thank you again."
6332,96,"Great experience! The house is such a cool log cabin and well stocked with everything we needed. Mark supplied lots of kitchen tools so we were able to cook in/ grill/ campfire meals every night of our week long stay. The house is so close to the river and the gushing water sounds amazing. The yard has awesome moss and ferns (so pretty) and our dogs loved running around with all the space. I’d recommend visiting the alpaca farm (Two Crows Alpaca Farm) 9 min away- super fun activity and nice couple runs the place. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to get away and unplug for awhile.

One thing to note was that this would not be a work-from-airbnb because there is no cell service and the wifi was coming on and off. texts/emails would not go through oftentimes. But if you want a true vacation without electronics distracting you (as we did!) then this is the perfect place to getaway and relax in the country!"
6333,96,"We enjoyed our stay here, it is definitely secluded and very peaceful! The cabin was clean and smelled great, they had everything needed to cook which we took advantage of since you aren’t close to town. We did go into town before the cabin and Murphy was cute and had some nice shops. They also had left s’mores ingredients on the table which was very thoughtful. Marks communication was great and he clearly cares that all goes well. When we got there there was a storm and the internet and satellite was out, because there was no cell reception I couldn’t call or text to say there was a problem. But Mark was already checking and knew there was an issue so it was resolved very quickly without effort on our part. Definitely recommend!"
6334,96,"Wonderful location and secluded
Nice creek we were very comfortable and will definitely come back."
6335,96,"Wow. This place is exactly what you dream of when trying to find a cabin in the woods. The porch overlooking the creek is so peaceful and the property is very well thought out. The cabin is fully stocked with necessaries as well as thoughtful touches! Mark is a great communicator and the instructions for the place are very clear and easy. I highly recommend this for anyone looking - and yes, it is very family friendly!"
6336,96,Wish we could have stayed longer
6337,96,"Awesome stay!!! Very welcoming and cozy cabin. The river right by it just tops it off. Loved all of the little extras like silk pillow cases, lush towels and wash cloths, beautiful shower and awesome gas stove. Will definitely be back here again."
6338,96,"The pictures don’t do it justice! It was paradise! It is definitely remote, so I recommend planning accordingly for food and supplies. The Hanging Dog general store has some surprisingly good options though. Also, if you turn left out of the driveway and drive a mile or so, you will see a beautiful waterfall."
6339,96,"Mark's place is fantastic! The location can't be beat. It's very beautiful, private, and serene. The cabin is very clean, comfortable, and cozy. You'll have everything you'll need at your fingertips. It's the ultimate retreat! The beds, linens, and towels are top notch. I highly recommend Mark's place! My family and I loved staying here! Mark is great with communication, too so if you do happen to need anything, he's able to help right away. Thank you, Mark! We hope to visit again soon!"
6340,96,"This was our third stay at the cabin and it never disappoints! Caught 4 trout, my family had a great time including our German Shepherd. The place is as advertised, it is quiet, really nice to step off your back porch and be able to fish. You will have a great time!"
6341,96,"This cabin and location is absolutely beautiful. We had so much fun playing in the creek, finding crayfish and salamanders and catching trout. The kitchen is well stocked. It was exactly the type of retreat we needed. Mark was very thorough with directions and easy to reach if we needed to communicate at any point. Wish we could have stayed longer than a week, hopefully we can make it back one day!"
6342,96,perfect little cabin in the mountains! the stream was beautiful everything was amazing! Mark was the best host!
6343,96,Do yourself a favor and book it. This is the place to disconnect and unwind. Very peaceful. We will be back!
6344,96,Easy paved roads. Nice and secluded so you can enjoy peace and quiet. The stream was so peaceful. Very easy communication with the owner. A great place to stay!
6345,96,"Good place to unwind and unplug. Perfect spot for fishing. I was a little put off by the cameras everywhere, took the charm out of being unplugged and away from everything. Cabin has a definate man vibe to it, good choice for guys fishing trip."
6346,96,"We loved our stay at Fern Hollow. The beds were so comfortable, the place was so clean, and the surroundings were amazing."
6347,96,Perfect place for peace and quiet away from reality
6348,96,"This is our second trip to Mark's cabin and this trip was just as good as the first! Beautiful cabin, beautiful private area, absolutely can not say enough good things. Our family of 5 and our very large dog were very comfortable and had a great time. We will most definitely be back again VERY soon!!"
6349,96,Great spot!
6350,96,Such a peaceful and beautiful place to stay to get away.
6351,96,"If you want peace and the ability to walk around in nature just out the front door, this spot is it. New kitchen items and newly remodeled shower. Propane fireplace and furniture in living room are comfy. Bunk beds were perfect for the kids. Front porch next to bubbling Brook was amazing. Firepit was great for hang time. Great host and fun small town of Murphy nearby."
6352,96,My husband and I (as well as our dogs) stayed at this cute little cabin. Lots of privacy and amazing spot right on the stream. Perfect place to relax and unwind. Mark was easy to communicate with and quick to respond.
6353,96,Great place!
6354,96,A great stay!
6355,96,"We loved our stay here and hope this becomes a regular getaway for us. I was a little concerned at first because there seemed to be a lot of rules, security and “red tape.” But once I got here I understood that this place is worth it. The cameras are there still, but they didn’t bother us. Rules are easy to follow and helpful. It has pretty much everything you’ll need. You’ll need to bring your own firewood for the fire pit."
6356,96,Had a lovely stay as always. Woke up or last morning to a few inches of snow. We were really sad to leave the winter wonder land. I'll definitely book again. So peaceful and relaxing.
6357,96,"Absolutely amazing place full of everything you need and want. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! Mark was an excellent host, communicating clearly throughout the trip. We had a fabulous time indoors and out! :)"
6358,96,"This is a super cozy, very clean, authentic cabin in a magical location. No cell service but the wifi was great for calls and e-mails. We tried like hell to stay outside all weekend, but the DVD collection made that impossible -- some of the best movies ever made are in this cabin! Everything is clearly marked (labels!), hooks galore (convenient!), great lighting, REAL candles (not common), clean and well-stocked kitchen, amazing fire pit right by the creek. Owner is a great communicator and can help with anything. Security cameras are fully disclosed, but beware -- there's no place outside or on the porch where a camera isn't watching. One is pointed at the cabin, and another tracks you while you walk! Feels excessive, but when you see this place, you'll get it. There's a lot more to protect here than privacy.

Pack a lunch and turn left out of the driveway. This cabin is right at the edge of heaven!"
6359,96,We had a wonderful experience and it was nice to unplug for a bit and enjoy ourselves and the surrounding locations.
6360,96,"This location was great, and the cabin was even better. I would recommend this stay, and look forward to returning. My favorite part was the outdoor fire pit by the river."
6361,96,"Great location right on the river, perfect for a quiet weekend away and very dog friendly!"
6362,96,Mark’s cabin is absolute heaven! We took our family there to celebrate our 10 year anniversary and were so pleased as soon as we arrived. The cabin is cozy and has everything we needed for a comfortable stay. The river and woods were so peaceful and soothing. We spent hours outside just taking it all in. The fireplace along with the cabins’ style and decor really made us feel as if we were in “the little cabin in the big woods.” We we’re sad to leave and plan to make another visit in the future.
6363,96,"Lovely setting, very relaxing. Enjoyed the trout stream and outdoor fire pit! Could use some updating……(furnishings, etc.)……but overall pretty good. We could see ourselves returning for another visit."
6364,96,Amazing property! It is worth it for the sound of the stream alone!
6365,96,"What a perfect place. Private, quiet, beautiful, cozy and settled off the road in the middle of Western Carolina's most gorgeous forests. Drives to hikes and waterfalls and ancient forests are under two hours or less. You can enjoy the lovely stream from the outdoor fire or from the porch. Mark makes everything easy and is very responsive to any questions you may have. This place is so special. We will be back!"
6366,96,Fern Hollow is a cozy cabin tucked away in the woods. The creek that runs behind the cabin is incredible! Mark does a wonderful job at making sure you have everything you need and answering all questions from the beginning until the end. It’s a wonderful place to get away!!!
6367,96,Scenic and beautiful. We enjoyed our stay very much.
6368,96,"This might be our favorite Airbnb stay ever! Mark has created a perfect escape at Fernhollow and we can't wait to return. The cabin is perfection, the creek is perfection, the proximity to both the town of Murphy and the National Forest...all perfection! Mark is also an incredibly thorough and helpful host. We would give it 6 stars if we could!"
6369,96,"Spent ten nights and had a great stay, despite a ton of rain. The creek is fantastic. To be able to fall asleep to that sound is truly amazing. Loved the porch. Rocking chairs with that view and soundtrack is so sweet. As other guests have mentioned, the cabin is clean and well-stocked. Shower water is nice and hot, though I might suggest replacing the curtain liner as well as raising the shower rod about 4"" so it doesn't get underfoot. Mark is easy to reach and very responsive.

One point I'd like to share with potential guests, as I did with Mark, is a camera on the outer facade of the porch...it points out to the creek. I noticed that as I moved, it followed me. Walked back, it followed me. When no objects are in view/moving, it returns to a centered position. Mark indicated he was unaware that it tracked this way, and that is a camera for security and for potential flood monitoring. He also stated he does not view activity notifications from cameras while guests are staying. Despite this, I can tell you it was very concerning to me when I first observed it.

It's a very special property. I do understand the need for owner security, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that level now that I've experienced it."
6370,96,We had a great stay at this cabin. It was clean and adorable. The internet worked great and it even had a home phone just in case you needed. The greatest part about this cozy cabin was the soothing sounds of the streaming water nearby. You could hear the water from the front porch rocking chairs which was my favorite part. Overall experience was perfect!
6371,96,"We had a nice relaxing time! GPS directions are spot on and checking in was very easy. We hiked a trail that was close called Grape smugglers Trail that was nice and easy. The brewery in town was a lot of fun, and pizza was great! Other then that we drove to Cherokee the rest of the time to hike there. Had a great stay, would recommend it."
6372,96,"Mark is great! We enjoyed staying at the cabin and unplugging, working on fly fishing skills (I caught 5 trout while we were there for 2.5 days), it was very relaxing. I recommend it!"
6373,96,Great Place! The entire place is well kept and clean. The stream and the property is amazing. Very quite and you feel like you have the area to yourself. The kitchen is very well stocked which is a huge plus when you never plan to leave (one of the best kitchens i have seen using air bnb). Highly recommend to anyone! It is a bit of a drive to get back to a store so it is best to get what you need on the way in. We never left once we arrived. Mark is great host and easy to communicate with. We hope to go back!
6374,96,"What an absolute find! I hesitate to write a glowing review as we want to keep this place our little secret! Perfect size for a comfy getaway complete with a cosy living room, huge windows, rocking chairs on the porch, extensive DVD collection (it was extra fun trying to choose!), and a stream that is literally right there outside your window. Nothing like cool air and white noise to relax every part of your body and mind. Our dog loved playing in the creek and snoozing on the porch. In all honesty, the photos don't do this rental justice; it will be even better than you think it is. Mark was an incredibly helpful and thoughtful host with lots of personal touches throughout the home. Additionally, the entire cabin was extremely clean, not an easy feat I'm sure for an outdoorsy, pet-friendly cabin. We are already trying to figure out how/when we can come back. Our only regret is we didn't book enough nights."
6375,96,"This is a hidden gem, a very nice and neat cabin, a good place to enjoy the mountains ⛰👍🏼💚"
6376,96,Mark is a great host!!
6377,96,Extremely nice! Had a great time. Would definitely stay there again.
6378,96,"This cabin is great! There were three adults in our party, and we all agreed that we could not
have found a better place. When you first leave your car, you hear the wonderful sound of the creek, which flows right in front of the cabin. There are several rocking chairs on the covered front porch so that you can sit and enjoy the sound effects! The cabin itself is well appointed with just about everything that we needed for our four-night stay. Mark provides good information before check-in, and he was readily available for the several questions that we texted him. Be sure that your phones are programmed for calling over wifi, because you will not get cell service. Murphy itself is a small community, and we had good food at the Red Brick Deli and at the Brewery. Don’t bother with the Chophouse, but do hit up The Sweet Tooth for some Mayfield’s ice cream!"
6379,96,This was exactly what we needed as a family. The cabin was stocked better than anyplace else we have stayed. Mark was great communicating with us. Unfortunately we did not catch any trout but my son and our dog had a blast playing in the creek. Overall it was a great vacation.
6380,96,"Mark’s cabin is a clean, comfortable place to stay about 15 minutes from town. The location right on a beautiful, fast-flowing stream is just incredible. You hear the rush of water as soon as you step out of your car. We spent much of our vacation fishing — and by fishing I mean standing by the water with fishing lines in a completely empty stream. The water is crystal clear and we saw no life the whole time we were there. But that was ok by us. Just standing out there was relaxing and restorative. My only issues with the cabin was that while the listing mentioned WiFi in the name and description of the cabin, I got a message the evening before check-in that we could not stream anything on his internet. That’s an important note that would have been nice to know when booking — not the day before arrival. I talked with him about it and he said he changed the listing to reflect that streaming is not allowed. Obviously, that’s not a dealbreaker in many cases, but if you plan to handle any work video calls while there or stream TV, music, movies, this isn’t the place for you. In that very lengthy note Mark also said he would only provide one roll of toilet paper and limited other items. That would have also been helpful to know beforehand as we are still trying to avoid going into stores now and had to stop along the way with a baby and two dogs. Not ideal. Overall, I would not book again because I feel the WiFi info was a bit of a bait and switch, but the location on the water is truly spectacular if you’re looking for a place to relax."
6381,96,Fern Hallow was absolutely perfect. Couldn't ask for more gorgeously secluded creek spot. Me and my dog hope to make this a regular getaway spot for us. Mark was an excellent host with great communication. You could really tell how much he cares for this beautiful cabin. Kitchen and cabin were well stocked with essentials.
6382,96,"Mark is an excellent host! The cabin was just as described! Clean, well maintained and fully stocked! We enjoyed our downtime watching movies and hanging out by the creek."
6383,96,One of the best furnished/decorated cabins I've ever stayed in. Great location and very clean.
6384,96,"Loved our stay at Mark’s cabin by the creek. Everything is as pictured and as described. Cabin was exceptionally clean with no visible bugs or cobwebs you might expect staying in a cabin. We enjoyed the charcoal grill, making a fire and roasting s’mores Mark left for us. The creek is great for wading and our dog loved it! Murphy is close by with a River walk and busy town square. Check out the new family operated Mimo’s for homemade ice cream! Would love to rebook this place in the fall!"
6385,96,Very beautiful and peaceful! if your looking for a quiet trip to just relax this is the place for you!
6386,96,This place is definitely a trip to remember. The cabin and stream were even better than they looked in the pictures.
6387,96,Great place for unwinding. The trout stream was a nice touch for this old fly fisherman! Quiet and nicely appointed. We will likely be back. Owner was great and made sure the cabin was clean and stocked with essentials.
6388,96,"We would definitely recommend this cabin and host. The place was spotless and very nicely furnished, and communication with Mark was always easy and helpful. Kitchen was well-equipped and the furniture and beds were comfortable."
6389,96,"Fern Hollow was nothing short of amazing!!! We traveled with small children and I was nervous, but there were even baby gates, board games & a sippy cup. The entire family thoroughly enjoyed this vacation and we would definitely stay there again!"
6390,96,"Great getaway! Cabin was very clean and felt very warm and homey. Perfect setting on a beautiful lot with a creek that has trout. Has all you need, private and so beautiful!!"
6391,96,"The cabin location is idyllic—-a true “gem”. Set well back from the road, through the woods, all with ease of access. We thoroughly enjoyed the sight and sound of the rushing stream throughout our stay—-so much so, we did not use air-conditioning so we could leave the windows open to enjoy the sound when in cabin. (Due to location- air would only be needed in late afternoon if the humidity climbs). With the exception of a brief trip to the quaint town of Murphy, we spent all our time at the cabin—either on the porch—-in our hammocks strung up right by the stream, or at the fire pit. We loved the setting of this cabin and did not want to leave—the stream and surrounding forest, the seclusion and privacy, were the best we have experienced of the many cabins we have stayed at in the mountains. The cabin was also very well stocked and the kitchen had everything we needed to cook all our meals—-we loved the gas stove. Cabin furnishings were comfortable, good lighting, ceiling fans and cozy decor. Great views from the very large, well placed screened and plentiful windows—brought the outdoors in. The choice of gas and/or charcoal grilling is a great amenity you don’t normally have (charcoal is ours), and was appreciated. We brought just one-of our pups, (even though Mark let us know we could bring both) and due to the clear and easy access to the stream —our senior doodle Annie was able to enjoy the area. Mark was an attentive host—wanting to make sure we enjoyed our stay and response was always quick. We would love to return someday! FYI: if you enjoy a scenic drive, turn left when leaving the driveway & head up the mountain, the road meanders along the stream, with small waterfalls, eventually turning into a well maintained narrow gravel road, if you take it over the mountain, (which we did) it becomes paved again and takes you into the Cherokee National Park, and the paved road is all along streams (eventually river) with incredible views and waterfalls. There are public restrooms along the way. It was a wonderful drive, that we took as we were headed home. The 3 hours it added to our travel home was well worth it!"
6392,96,Mark gives great details/directions about his home and Murphy. He responded quickly to some questions we had. The place is very cute and the stream nearby is very peaceful. Definitely recommend if you’re staying in Murphy!
6393,96,"This cabin exceeded my expectations. It was so comfortable and cozy! We loved the fireplace inside and all the cooking and kitchen supplies provided. The beds are comfortable and it was SPARKLING CLEAN!
We really appreciated how Mark left supplies for s’mores’ too! Our favorite part was the outdoor area with plenty of chairs, fire pit, and the creek. My 4 year old son spent the entire weekend fishing and playing in the water. It was exactly what we were hoping for and more!"
6394,96,The cabin was immaculate and the proximity to the creek was one of the best features. Mark was a great host with stellar communication and would always answer questions in a span of minutes.
6395,96,"This house is great! The spot on the creek is wonderful, I caught 2 brook trout there and it is a great spot to fly fish. Mark was a very kind host, thoughtful with many details, suggestions about what to do and the area. The internet is not made for streaming, but allowed access to phone calls, check email, web surfing, etc. It is very secluded and comfortable, a great spot to unplug and unwind. We will look forward to staying there again soon."
6396,96,This was a great secluded cabin. Mark was great about staying in contact in case we needed anything. The stream and outdoor space were beautiful and just what we needed for some relaxation. We didn’t want to leave.
6397,98,"What a beautiful and fantastic place to relax and unwind. A truly unique, thoughtful and inspiring retreat. Catherine and Rick were perfect hosts who’ve poured hard work and life dreams into creating and sharing this “River Runs Trough It” homestead. It was a wonderful experience! Thank you for sharing your story and property with us!"
6398,98,"My fiancé and I couldn’t stop raving about this place! Catherine was so responsive and inviting even before we arrived. The cabin and the view were indescribable! Catherine and her husband Rick, take such amazing care of their farm, it doesn’t even look real. This was hands down our favorite getaway, and we can’t wait to go back again! We highly recommended booking this place, you will be jaw dropped! Thank you so much Catherine and Rick!!!"
6399,98,"I am not even sure where to begin! For our anniversary each year, my husband and I choose a getaway and I have to say this place exceeded ALL of our expectations and is the best place we have stayed so far!! Catherine and Rick were beyond helpful and friendly and made our stay so enjoyable. The place was so beautiful, clean and so incredibly peaceful! We are already planning our next stay with them and absolutely cannot wait! Thank you Catherine and Rick for sharing your home with us!!"
6400,98,"Wow this place was absolutely beautiful!! It’s great in pictures, but even better in person! The cabin was wonderfully decorated and was so comfortable! The location was great, close to Asheville and downtown Waynesville. Not far from grocery stores, restaurants, and amazing hikes within an hour drive through the mountains. There’s a ton to see on the property as well. Catherine was absolutely wonderful and very helpful! We can’t wait to come back!"
6401,98,"I must say, this place absolutely exceeded my expectations. Not only was Catherine (and her husband) incredibly kind, she made us feel right at home on their entire property. The views are some of the best in North Carolina and we felt like we had our own private cabin in the middle of the mountains. If I could give 6 stars I would haha!
Thank you again for everything!"
6402,98,You all are an incredible couple and we loved having you! Your stay not only supports the farm but makes it fun for us to share it. Thank you for taking the time to write a very generous review and for taking exceptional care of the cabin. We hope you will consider another visit soon!
6403,98,"I couldn’t get home fast enough to complete my review!! This place is absolutely BREATHTAKING!! If the days you want are available, just book now! Although the pictures in the listing are captivating, the pictures don’t really capture the beauty of this place! I think my favorite part was the serenity, extremely quiet and peaceful. I traveled here as a single, woman and I felt very safe my entire stay, I even had the garage door up at night while I settled in for the evening! The bed and sheets are absolute luxury, better than any hotel! Catherine’s communication is prompt and thoughtful! Although pets are welcome here, if you aren’t a “pet-person”, I guarantee you will never know this is a pet-friendly rental— it is absolutely spotless and no odd smells! I felt right at home! This is my first time traveling to an airbnb where I was planning my next visit before I checked out✨"
6404,98,You are a dream Erika! Thank you for your very generous and insightful reveiw! We loved having you and appreciate how enthusiastic and supportive you are. We hope you will indeed plan a return visit and experience a different season!
6405,98,Catherine’s great! 17N was absolutely beautiful!!! 10/10 would recommend.
6406,98,"You all are a 10/10 too! Thank you for being so delightful, enthusiastic and taking the time to review your stay! Come back anytime!"
6407,98,"Had such a peaceful weekend! The most beautiful views! It was incredibly clean, and had everything we needed stocked so it made things easy. I can’t wait to go back again! The aesthetic was superb, well decorated. The linens/towels were abundant and great quality. A plus is the bed/pillows were very comfortable as well. Catherine is very quick to respond/super friendly and that was very helpful. Oh also we especially loved the location as it seemed off in the middle of nowhere with its views, but it actually was only a short drive to the grocery store and that was beyond convenient. It’s honestly the best place we’ve vacationed at in the NC mountains, it’s truly phenomenal. Worth every penny. We will definitely be back."
6408,98,"Claire, you and NIck are delightful and we cannot express how much your generous and thoughtful review means to us! Thank you for taking the time to share your experience in a detailed and positive way. We appreciate your staying with us and taking great care of the new cabin! Your stay directly helps support our farm as we recover from the impacts of the last few years and this means the world to us. Thank you and please come back anytime!"
6409,98,"If you’re lucky enough to find this, book it. The view is amazing! Attention to detail, great host."
6410,98,Y’all are great! We loved having you and appreciate your kind review and enthusiasm! Please come back anytime; we would love to have you!
6411,98,"This place was simply magical. It was the perfect getaway for the weekend. My husband and I woke up to beautiful views and private sunrises. Catherine was so kind and generous, super responsive. I would stay again!"
6412,98,Loved having you all and so very appreciate your kind words! Please come back anytime and maybe even try a different season! Thank you for staying with us!
6413,98,"Catherine is a fantastic host, and her place is absolutely breathtaking! The photos don’t even do it justice. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone wanting to be off the grid but still have all the comforts of home as well. An unforgettable experience!"
6414,98,Thank you Jack for your generous review and support of our farm with your stay and purchases! You all make hosting fun for us and we hope to see you again someday!
6415,98,"This is the most beautiful farm with Mountain View’s. It is so peaceful and perfect! The tiny house is so nice and we loved it. The animals are so cool ..so much fun to watch!
We will be back!!"
6416,98,You all are so fun and ethusiastic! Thank you for sharing your experience and we hope you will return for splendid Spring weather!
6417,98,"i absolutely loved this spot. me and my girlfriend have made a hobby to secluded a little air B&Bs that are worth their price point and everything about this airbnb hit it perfectly. for us it’s easily top 8 of the hundreds we’ve been too. It is such a perfect romantic getaway spot. with great views and awesome trails to walk. and don’t forget to bring your pups because my dog absolutely loved the area it’s fenced it very well so both your furry kids and the local wildlife are safe. the kitchen is a little hard to work with but you’ll manage as i was able to make some good breakfast, lunch, and dinner with what’s in the kitchen area."
6418,98,"We had an amazing time at the farm! We had some unexpected snow causing some frozen pipes, but Catherine and her husband were so hospitable and generous, helping us with everything we needed to make it the most relaxing and enjoyable weekend!! If you’re looking for a getaway that’s close to things, but also so secluded and cozy, this is it! We will be back :)"
6419,98,Everything was perfect. The view is incredible and the farm is very peaceful. We would love to book again in the near future.
6420,98,"Absolutely beautiful spot. Very private location, honestly an incredible getaway. First day we walked around the farm, fished right on the farm and explored Waynesville. Second day we drove to Great Smokey Mountains and Blue Ridge Mountains. The view just from the cabin was worth it."
6421,98,"Amazing!! I feel blessed to have found this location. The whole experience from the day of booking till the day we left was 10/10!! I would recommend this to everyone that is looking to truly have some peace and tranquility. The views are stunning day and night!

Relaxing on the hammock at night looking at all the stars was definitely something we enjoyed! Even napping on the chairs outside during the day was very enjoyable because of waking up to those awesome views.

We enjoyed seeing our neighbors (the farm animals!) from a distance. The mangalitsa pigs is something you have to see in person! Always learning something new, never knew pigs like that existed!

Everything was clean, comfortable and perfect! We didn’t walk around the farm and explore but next time we will for sure!!

Location is perfect. Decent drive to go on hiking trails or going to explore Asheville.

Catherine is GREAT!!!! She went out of her way to talk to us the day we left. She made it that much more special!!"
6422,98,"The host, Catherine, was amazing . She was very responsive and met with us on arrival and explained everything provided a map ( the property is massive) and provided her personal number so that you could contact her with any needs. The hospitality alone made it worth it

The actual listing is amazing . This is the perfect getaway to escape your adult responsibilities and just relax. Absolutely somewhere I would go again.

P.S they have curly haired pigs that look like sheep…. lol !"
6423,98,"There are no words to describe how beautiful, peaceful, & serene Catherine’s place, 17°N, is. The cabin was super clean and had everything we needed. The view from the cabin is just breathtaking—mountains, the Pigeon River, and all of the farm animals grazing. Catherine was super helpful and quick in responding to my many questions. She even hand drew us a map of the property. It was great having full access to explore the property and fish the river. Love that the place is pet friendly and we could bring our pup! She loved exploring the grounds. The farm is in such a great location, secluded and quiet, yet close to the interstate, gas stations, stores, and restaurants. We even brought some Mangalitsa sausage home with us. Catherine made this process super easy. Great place, would definitely stay again!"
6424,98,Catherine met us at the gate when we arrived. She is extremely kind and her property is beautiful. We were very grateful to be able to stay in such a peaceful location. It was fun to meet all the animals on the property as well.
6425,98,"This is a little slice of heaven! You will not regret your stay here, the nature and view make it impossible to not relax and be completely happy. Unheard of views, animals everywhere to see while still pet friendly for your own fur babies, wonderful vacation, wonderful host !!! Nothing negative to say, we will be back every year!"
6426,98,Amazing spot! Beautiful and very clean. Kind service and hospitality
6427,98,"We had a great stay at Catherine’s cabin. It was clean, and the bed and linens were really comfortable! The farm and grounds were absolutely beautiful. The farm animals were really fun to watch and the views were amazing. Catherine was friendly and easy to communicate with. Highly recommend."
6428,98,You all are a joyful mother daughter team and we are so glad you enjoyed your stay and had the opportunity to meet you too. You make hosting fun for us! We hope you will consider another visit soon!
6429,98,Super pretty place to say. Beautiful views!
6430,98,"Such a great stay! The place was very clean and very accurate regarding the listing. The view was beautiful, Catherine was very helpful, and overall we’d love to come back!"
6431,98,"Waking up to coffee with amazing views and camp fires, close to a town with good dining, bistros and quaint shops nearby is what we hoped our mother, daughter trip would be about. This place was all that! The horses just outside our cabin in the morning added to the beautiful view. The cabin in the sky is beautifully decorated and impeccable. The bed and bedding is better than what you find in luxury hotels and the place has everything you need. The only thing we didn't anticipate was the steep, gravel road leading up to cabin. Going up was a bit nerve wracking for my 84 yr old mom but after a few trips up and down, she was fine and then it was...Wow... what a view! You will love the host too, Catherine was personable and accommodating to us during our stay. We highly recommend this place!"
6432,98,My pleasure to help you all with your luggage and thank you for being so delightful! I am impressed by the adventure you and your mother were on up from Florida! Thank you for your kind and informative review and for helping support our farm. We hope you will consider another visit in the future.
6433,98,Beautiful spot and very clean!
6434,98,Pictures don’t do it justice. The home is beautiful and are perfect for a nice little getaway.
6435,98,Thank you for your kind review and we are thrilled that you enjoyed your stay! Please come back anytime!
6436,98,"We could not have been more thrilled with our stay. The views left us speechless, we loved having farm animals as our only neighbors, and the cabin was clean, spacious, and has great proximity to restaurants, breweries, and hiking spots. Catherine is a wonderful host and really thought of everything to make our experience enjoyable and relaxing. We have already recommended this place to so many of our friends and family and can't wait to book here again!"
6437,98,"Kyle you are all dream guests and it thrills us to share our farm and new cabin with folks who are firendly, excited and appreciative! Truly y'all are great and we would love for you to return for another visit some time soon! Thank you for staying with us and helping support the farm and for taking the time to write such a generous review!"
6438,98,"FANTASTIC! Beautiful views, excellent host, and impeccable cleanliness. Great location for sightseeing (Biltmore, Cataloochee Valley, Waynesville, etc.), but you may choose to spend most of your time at this lovely location. We are looking forward to returning soon."
6439,98,You all were amazing! We cannot thank you enough for taking such amazing care of the new cabin and for writing such a generous review! Thank you for taking the stress and worry out of hosting. We are so glad to meet friendly exuberant people; you make it fun! We hope to see you again soon Justin! Cheers!
6440,98,This place was absolutely amazing. Perfectly clean and had everything you needed for a cozy get away. Catherine encouraged us to explore the farm which was awesome. There are nice chairs around the property and the views are incredible. Would absolutely recommend and hopefully return !!
6441,98,Hi Allie! We are thrilled you enjoyed your stay and are honored to entertain the idea of hosting a wedding or private event! Simply reach out with details and we will work with you to tailor a custom event. Thank you for considering us! Come back soon!
6442,98,"This place is phenomenal! It was exactly what we needed. We wanted a view, seclusion and a place that we could just enjoy each other for our 5th anniversary. The view was unmatched. Catherine was so upbeat and pleasant when we arrived and did a full walk through explaining anything we may have had questions with. We walked the farm and went down to the creek/River and enjoyed all of it. There really are no words — go and see for yourself! We will be returning ♥️"
6443,98,You all were just glowing when you arrived and I am so glad to have played a special part in your 5th anniversary! Thank you for writing such a generous review and for taking such amazing care or our new cabin. We look forward to seeing you again!
6444,98,"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. Could not recommend more. Great host!"
6445,98,"Catherine was a wonderful host. Breath taking views, calm and peaceful property, and surrounded by animals. Don’t look any further, this is the perfect spot for a getaway!"
6446,98,Jason you all were so wonderful to trust our listing and book without any reviews! Thank you for taking such great care of the new cabin and for helping support our farm! Thank you too for taking the time to share your experience in a wonderful way! We loved having you and hope you will consider us again in the future. Cheers!
6447,98,Catherine was so amazing. The communication was perfect. The property is absolutely beautiful. Will definitely stay here again.
6448,100,"We stayed here while visiting family in Pittsboro for a long weekend. The accommodations where exactly what we were looking for. David & Alicia provide a fantastic get away with a beautiful location. It is easy to see how much care went into creating this perfect 1 bedroom home away from home. Everything was clean & tidy, and well cared for. David availed himself to us to reach out if we needed anything and his communication was thorough and timely. We will stay here again and recommend to anyone who is looking for a place close to Chapel Hill area to give it a try."
6449,100,"We stayed here for 2 nights and loved our time here! We came after a busy wedding weekend and it was a great place to relax. We enjoyed the short trail walk to the creek from the house and appreciated the quiet. Our dog loved being off leash and hiking around the property with us. The property is beautiful and in a peaceful, secluded area. The house is very easy to get to from Chapel Hill as it’s a straight shot down Jones Ferry Rd. David checked us in even though we arrived late at about 8pm. He showed us around the property briefly. David provided us with essentials such as good coffee, oatmeal, and tea. We will definitely be back!"
6450,100,Perfection!
6451,100,I really enjoy this spot and can't wait to return again! Amazing host and location.
6452,100,"This has to be one of the most beautiful settings for an Airbnb we’ve stayed at. Peaceful quite woods, big trees, bubbling fountains out the window. The architecture of the place is unique, everything was very comfortable and felt very private. Kitchen and bathroom had everything we needed, bed was comfy. The 10 acres of grounds were peaceful and we enjoyed a morning walk in the woods with our coffees. David was super friendly and welcoming and we were lucky enough to get to chat with him a bit and he had so much great info about the area and the property, it really made our stay there feel very special. Highly recommend and I suspect we’ll be back!"
6453,100,"This place is the definition of serenity! David is an integral part of the experience, and he was one of the best hosts I’ve encountered on Airbnb. The house is perfect for a getaway or even a one night stay. I was lucky enough to spend some time on the land and it was truly a wonderful experience. The architecture and engineering of the property is marvelous, so be sure to get into all the details. David is like a family member, I’ll definitely be back the next time I’m in town!"
6454,100,"Great location, beautiful house, wonderful host. This was a great experience and a perfect place to get away. Highly recommend!"
6455,100,"I cannot say enough wonderful things about David and Forest Garden! I came for rest, restoration, and to inspire more creativity in my work. Forest Garden is the most beautiful, magical place! David is so dedicated to stewarding the land and is probably the most wonderful and accommodating Air Bnb host I've ever experienced. I will most certainly be back!"
6456,100,"A little piece of Heaven! David greeted us, gave a tour of the property and lots of interesting history on the place. Our space was beautiful and peaceful, well appointed and comfortable in every way. Super comfortable bed!
The surrounding grounds are spectacular, lovely walking paths through woods.
Perfection! I wish we could have stayed longer !"
6457,100,"Lovely house, lovely garden, lovely host. Even on a cold, rainy day, this place felt warm and inviting. The host provided everything we might need, and then some. We loved the furniture, the art and well curated book selection, the architectural embellishments, the fields of blooming Lenten roses surrounding the house, the peace and quiet. Chapel Hill and its wonderful restaurants are just fifteen minutes down the road. We won't hesitate to book this Airbnb the next time we are in the area. Wish we could have stayed longer."
6458,100,"‘Forest Garden’ is a gem, nestled in a field of Lenten roses, with garden water features creating an experience for all the senses when entering the lovely cottage. The beautifully detailed interior spaces, with views of nature in every direction, are well appointed and include all the comforts of home. David is a generous host, welcoming and a joy to talk with. We look forward to visiting again for more than one night!"
6459,100,"Retreat is the right word for this beautiful cottage in the woods! If you are looking for a place to feel renewed and inspired, David’s cottage is a great choice. I loved the attention to detail and beautiful design, and David is a host extraordinaire. I came for a solo retreat, to journal and take space from my family life, and it was just the quiet and rejuvenation I was needing. My only regret was not booking for more nights!"
6460,100,Hidden gem! Can’t wait to return. Very peaceful place to disconnect and decompress. The host was great and the ground was beautiful! It has everything you need.
6461,100,My Fiancé and I had the best time at David’s place. We brought our Goldendoodle and David was super accommodating. My fiancé described this place and magical and the best valentines getaway. We will definitely be coming back.
6462,100,Absolutely stunning property and house! The pictures do not do this place justice. I will definitely be back!
6463,100,"If you’re looking for solitude and a quiet place to reconnect with nature and yourself, this is the perfect place. Beautiful setting for this architectural stunner. David was an attentive host; filling us in on the history of the property and the surrounding area. He immediately made us feel comfortable and welcome.
Our three day visit went too fast!
Oscar (our mini schnauzer) is going to miss those morning nature walks."
6464,100,Absolutely fantastic place! I found my 2nd home! Lol! Definitely plan to return in the spring or summer to take advantage of the trails and forest.
6465,100,"If you’re deliberating on booking, STOP! GO ahead and book!! Such a beautiful, artful, healing space. More than I could have ever imagined!!"
6466,100,Had a lovely weekend stay at the forest retreat.
6467,100,Both the guest house and the location were a dream. The house is spotless (and very tastefully appointed) and it abuts a beautiful and serene forest with trails alongside a stream. David was a fantastic host. A totally perfect stay.
6468,100,"David's listing was so inviting and relaxing from the moment we stepped out of our car. He was a wonderful host and was very quick in responding to us for anything we needed. The kitchen had everything one needs to make a meal and David was very thoughtful and generous with the snacks, coffee, tea and breakfast items left for us. The bed was comfortable and the shower much bigger than it looks in the picture and the entire home is clean, comfortable, surprisingly spacious, and aesthetically and architechturaly beautiful. The surrounding grounds and pathways through the woods are indeed magical and incredibly peaceful. It was a wonderful opportunity to stay in such a lovely and private home and still be close enough to explore all that the Chapel Hill and surrounding area offers. I would love to come here again soon!"
6469,100,Arguably the most beautiful and relaxing Airb we've been to. Thanks David!
6470,100,"All good, Jack. And I hope to have your and Grace’s company again. Also, thanks for the invite to visit when in Austin."
6471,100,An outstanding experience. David is an outstanding host and we very much appreciate the time he took to answer any/all questions we had about the surrounding area. David's dedication to the property shows in the attention to detail throughout the one bedroom retreat. Anyone looking for a quick escape for some quiet time with nature will appreciate staying here.
6472,100,"It’s always nice to get off the beaten path and David’s garden cottage gives you the rare chance to do so without sacrificing any amenities. Nestled into the woods, it’s akin to stepping into the pages of your favorite story book. Highly recommended and worth any extra miles it may add to your journey."
6473,100,We had a great stay! David was a wonderful host and the place was beautiful. Highly recommend!!!
6474,100,This quiet getaway is just as described/pictured! You can't go wrong if you're looking for a quiet getaway. The short trail down to the creek is so peaceful and it was a great way to relax and get out of the city for a night!
6475,100,"David was a tremendous and caring host for my family and me. He was inviting, proactive, and generous with his knowledge and time. The home was beautiful, with intriguing details and set in an idyllic forest. We will certainly be returning to this peaceful and welcoming place. Thank you, David!"
6476,100,David was so sweet and very accommodating. We can't wait to come back!!
6477,100,"An architectural gem with a touch of whimsy. Plus, it's DOG FRIENDLY!

First of all, David is a friendly host who responded to our inquiries quickly. The cottage is remarkable! The construction quality and interior mill-work are simply amazing! This is not an ordinary cottage.

The cottage is a nice size and very well equipped. David doesn't want dogs on the furniture, but he thoughtfully provides a sofa cover so you dog can snuggle with you on the couch while you read a book. The small kitchen has mini-appliances (stove/range, refrigerator, and dishwasher) plus all the necessary dishes, pots and pans. The bathroom is larger than it looks in the pictures, as is the corner shower.

Situated on a large wooded lot, there is walking trail on the property. Our dog enjoyed walking in the woods. Even though the cottage shares property with David's house (a short walk away and visible through the back windows), it is a quiet, relaxing, and private retreat."
6478,100,amazing place. amazing host. amazing stay.
6479,100,"What a magical place, and so wonderful for our two dogs too run around. It was perfect, and very close to restaurants and dog parks and shopping in a beautiful area of NC. Definitely returning!"
6480,100,Loved our short stay at David’s place! David was very communicative!
6481,100,"Though our stay was short, it was well worth the stop. Forest Garden is serene and picturesque, an artful delight surrounded by natural beauty."
6482,100,Very peaceful stay. David was an excellent host. We loved being so close to nature!
6483,100,"The cottage was beautiful and peaceful, with plenty of room for my dog to explore off-leash! David was a wonderful host."
6484,100,Best host we have had! So much better than a hotel. The place is beautiful and engineered to bring nothing but relaxation and a break from the noisy city. Our host was kind to supply everything you could want for coffee and a good breakfast which came in handy for us as we flew into town and didn’t bring anything like that. We slept very well being secluded and woke up refresh to take an easy hike around the property that was beautiful. We hope to be fortunate to travel to North Carolina and stay here again.
6485,100,"We simply must stay here again. Best air bnb experience we’ve both had. David is a spectacular and kind host, capable of being sociable or giving us space when we wanted it. The property is gorgeous and David did us the favor of giving us a tour of its various features and buildings. We were celebrating a birthday and he took this into account when greeting us at check in (very sweet) The space itself is peaceful and clean and the kitchen is fully stocked. Very quiet. The walk on the path through the woods was pleasant even with the rain. Perfect escape from family chaos during the holiday :-) 10/10"
6486,100,"Check in was flawless, cottage was cozy and quaint. Perfect for a romantic getaway."
6487,100,"David's Forrest Garden is stunning, spacious, and serene. The home has everything you need and more for a comfortable stay. We stopped for two nights on our way from FL to VA. We visited with friends nearby. I would love to return for a meditation retreat. The tranquility and surrounding nature were an uncommon treat from our city lives. There is a little nature trail on the property too. David is genuinely a hospitalitarian. He welcomed us in and checked to see we had everything we needed. All of these were already thought of and provided, such as tea, coffee, cream, and breakfast items. The kitchen and bathroom were fully stocked, and the home was clean and beautiful."
6488,100,"We live in the area and sought a retreat from our usual bustle/grind and this was a wonderful place to land. Incredibly unique and stunning details, lovely forest to walk in and a very quick jaunt to Carrboro and Pittsboro for delightful meals. Highly recommend!"
6489,100,"David was the consummate host. His property is gorgeous, with natural wooded settings and serene views from every window. The house is perfectly appointed with every necessity and thoughtful detail. Those who appreciate good construction and architecture will revel in staying here. The space affords peaceful contemplation and feels worlds away from the bustle of nearby towns. David offered us perfect recommendations for brunch and was so helpful in getting us settled in on our first night. He gave us plenty of privacy, but was always readily available when needed. We loved our honeymoon stay here, and would love to return in the future!"
6490,100,"This elegant, amazing stay is beautiful and peaceful!"
6491,100,"Very tranquil, very clean, very beautiful space. I came here for a solo retreat to do some writing, and it was really the perfect spot to do some focused work and get inspired by nature. The bed was comfortable and I slept really well. The kitchen had everything I needed- and more! If you are looking for a peaceful, quiet place that feels remote but is actually very close to many wonderful offerings in the triangle area, this is your spot!"
6492,100,"The Forest Garden is a beautifully built space on a beautiful property. We loved spotting the frogs before they jumped into the pond. Perfect getaway, but still conveniently located - easy to get around to nearby towns and events. Highly recommend!"
6493,100,"Wonderful, peaceful, magical spot in the woods between Pittsboro and Chapel Hill. We would be happy to stay there again!"
6494,100,Very clean and nice property. The craftsmanship inside the unit is impressive. This includes the hardwood floors and crown moldings. Nice amenities included. Our biggest concern is that if you stay in this unit be prepared to decompress from electronics. Satellite WiFi is poor and sporadic. No TV in the unit which is fine but cannot use tablets or phones due to poor internet. Cell service is one bar too at least on ATT. Host is great and very responsive to your needs.
6495,100,"Hello, Bruce. I'm checking in with you after investigating with HughesNet, my satellite-based internet provider, about the connectivity issues you encountered while staying at Forest Garden, Their answer was that the account had exceeded its data limits, and as a result connection slowed to a crawl. What they failed to do was message that I needed to purchase additional data to restore what speed their service can provide!!! I'm upset both for your inconvenience as well as mine. When the service runs at the allowable speeds (25+ MbS) one can readily send/receive email; Zoom; and run videos, albeit not in HD (high definition). At the time you reported the lack of access it didn't occur to me that it was a deliberate slowing of service, something that could have been remedied within a few minutes. My deepest apologies."
6496,100,"This place is magical! From David’s kindness and hospitality to the charming cottage, thoughtful details, and serene forest setting, you couldn’t ask for a more peaceful getaway. Just a short drive into Carrboro, Cary, or Chapel Hill if you want to take advantage of fun shopping and great restaurants. Or just stroll through the surrounding forest and keep an eye out for all the wonderful “Easter eggs” like the butterfly benches by the creek or the gathering of angelic figurines. I will definitely be back!"
6497,100,This place is absolutely idyllic and David was a wonderful host. Definitely would stay again!
6498,100,"An absolute dream of a getaway for myself, my husband, and our two dogs. Forest Garden is a magical space of healing, and David is a wonderful host. We hope to return!"
6499,100,Forest Garden is a beautiful and healing space! David is an incredible host. David has such a great attention to detail. I did not want for anything! Thank you so much
6500,100,Very cool place to stay. David was very welcoming and showed us around. The house was comfortable and the trail through the woods was a big plus for us!
6501,100,"Beautiful, Artistic and Peaceful jewel box of a cabin just outside of Carrboro /Chapel Hill - David was an exceptional host for our recent stay in the cabin and had great local recommendations for food in the area. The cabin was an easy drive from Carrboro where we enjoyed dinner, drinks and a walkabout. In the morning we had coffee and a nice walk on the trails and enjoyed the woods and gardens that surround the cabin. We had a terrific visit and will definitely return when our travels bring us back to the area."
6502,100,"If you're look for a tranquil retreat, you've found it. Out of all of the Airbnbs we've stayed at over there years, the serenity we found at Forest Park is unmatched. The home and grounds are perfect, and one can tell that David has put a lot of thought and care into making every guest's stay an incredible experience. He also has lots of great tips on things to do while you are in the area. This is definitely one to keep on your short list of Airbnbs to remember."
6503,100,It was a perfect stop on our weekend journey wish we could have stayed longer and really gotten to enjoy the beautiful home and area around. It was such a peaceful night David was a great host made sure we got safely to the unit since it was dark during arrival and had everything perfect and ready for us. Will definitely be trying to come back if we are in the area again
6504,100,"Quiet, clean, charming, incredibly well equipped. David is likewise incredibly easy and helpful."
6505,100,"The absolute best experience we’ve ever had with Airbnb. David was the most attentive and helpful host I’ve ever had. The location is absolutely stunning and a perfect place to just breathe and take a pause from the rush of every day life. We had the most relaxing and rejuvenating experience and will definitely be back as soon as we can. The house was well appointed, the linens and bed were perfect quality and we slept with ease and the with the sound of nature all around us. A perfect getaway."
6506,100,"We have hosted an Airbnb property for many years and stayed in dozens of Airbnbs. David's listing is sublime, a textbook example of property and hosting perfection and one of our best Airbnb experiences ever."
6507,100,"Wonderful. So glad you were able to meet Robert and explore the land a bit. And, thank you for the invite. Let’s stay in touch."
6508,100,"A true zen refuge…beautifully designed & immersed in a picturesque, peaceful wooded landscape. This is a perfect place to escape the chaos & reconnect and recharge. To top it off, David is truly a one-of-a kind host. He has a warmth & wisdom that perfectly accentuates the experience. If your looking for a peacefully rich experience, this is it! Thank you David!"
6509,100,"This stay is a gem, David is a very hospitable and respectful host who has thought of everything needed to make your stay as comfortable as possible. The house is well stocked, clean, and nestled in the woods away from the distractions of day to day life. We enjoyed our stay very much and loved seeing deer and frogs in the morning outside the house! I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a much needed break from the busy-ness of life to relax."
6510,100,"David's place was exceptionally clean and well kept, beautifully decorated, well stocked, and surrounded by a forest of trees with a small pond in the main garden. The host communication was impeccable.
It would be pertinent for other AirBnB customers to note, however, that the place is not quite as private as the pictures suggest. The overview of the place does not include the fact that the owner's workshop is located directly adjacent to the property and the main house quite visible from inside the living room (in the summer). I was a bit surprised when I arrived given the previous reviews and pics (none of which show the buildings around the house).
Nonetheless, if this does not matter to you then it's truly a gem of a place. I have given it a 5 star review anyway because others may not necessarily be looking for perfect solitude...."
6511,100,"Forest Garden is a beautifully curated, cozy and comfortable space. The surrounding woods and nearby fountain are comforting and serene. The house is tastefully designed and modern, with a great kitchen and wide porch.

David was a super accommodating and attentive host and I can say enough nice things about him or the stay. Truly a little oasis in the forest."
6512,100,"My partner and I were in town visiting family and thoroughly enjoyed our stay on David’s property. The home itself is the perfect size for two people, and was a quiet respite from our otherwise hectic schedule. I would absolutely stay there again if I were to come back to the area."
6513,100,"Cannot speak highly enough about both David and the house. The house is truly amazing - comfortable, beautiful, peaceful - really just a perfect time. David’s attention to detail is remarkable - everything was taken care of and he made sure we were as happy and comfortable as possible. Highly recommend!"
6514,100,"Could not pick a better place to unplug and relax in nature. Clean, beautiful locale, will be back!"
6515,100,"The Forest House is beautiful, nestled in the woods, with ample privacy and calm. David was an exceptional host, giving you space but quick to respond whenever you need him. I highly recommend this beautiful place to anyone seeking respite from a busy world!"
6516,100,"This place is magnificent, and David is a joy of a host. Only regret is not being able to stay longer!"
6517,100,Catch ya on the flip side!
6518,100,"What a peaceful and lovely house! The space is tranquil, open and inspiring, and David’s attention to detail made my stay feel so special. Will definitely stay again. Thank you!"
6519,100,This is an amazing property and we had a wonderful stay at David's Airbnb. Our host was very helpful and courteous. He went above and beyond the average host to make us comfortable. We will come back!
6520,100,"David, I’m counting on you all returning!"
6521,100,"I didn't actually personally stay here (my partner did), but setting up the stay, making an alteration, and the stay itself were all great according to my partner, and they plan to go again the next time they have time off from work.

They described it as peaceful and magical, so I'd say you're safe to stay here if that's in the ballpark of what you're looking for. Cheers!"
6522,100,"This was the perfect getaway! The house was just what I was looking for to reset my mind. There are plenty of air bnbs near my home, but they are all beach themed. So to find this gem was amazing. The house was inviting, had everything I needed. WIFI was dependable. And this may be weird, but as I was growing up, my grandmother's home was styled and designed very similar and she had an area that was almost like a library. When I walked into the forest house, that's the smell that I got and it was incredible. It was relaxing and a nostalgic blast from the past. I am already saving up money to come back!

The water features were right by the bedroom window so you get lulled into a comfortable sleep to the sounds of water trickling. It was extremely soothing. The bed was comfy too! The shower was the perfect size with an amazing amount of water pressure!

David was kind and courteous. He would check in on me to make sure I had what I needed, but was also very respectful of the reason I was up there, to just turn off my mind for a few days!"
6523,100,"A, the legacy of Forest Garden comes from its original use: Betty Phillips who passed away a few years ago was a psychologist that saw clients there, and her husband, Robert, who still lives here, built it for her. There’s close to twenty years of healing in that space and the surrounding land. Wishing you health and happiness."
6524,100,"Davis was beyond hospitable. The house was so peaceful, and the architecture was beautiful. The sounds of nature and his water fixtures outside were so tranquil, we didn’t want to leave. Would love to be able to go back and stay again!"
6525,100,A great interior designers dream. So perfectly put together. Wanted to stay for the rest of the summer. Was a perfect surprise for my lovely partner for her birthday.
6526,100,"Wonderfully decorated, lovely place. We truly enjoyed our stay."
6527,100,"And thank you, Amelia, for your sweet entry in “Woodland Notes”"
6528,100,"Forest Garden was amazing ! It was the perfect solo getaway destination to tune out and tap in. The trails were easily accessible and peaceful , the ambient sounds of the forest and fountains mingling together (plus a hot cup of tea) were everything to start off the day ! David was an awesome host , he made sure I was well taken care of for my stay . He was knowledgeable and kind and very accommodating . I don’t write many reviews but this was well worth it !"
6529,100,"Thank you, Delona, for your kind words. I hope to see you again."
6530,100,"The forest garden was a beautiful little guest house. Very relaxing, crisp with detail, and cozy. David was a gracious host who was very accommodating and accessible if needed."
6531,100,"I’ve experienced hospitality around the world and know from conversations with friends in the hospitality industry (Ritz Carlton and W Hotel guest experience designers) that it’s the little touches and details that make for memorable travel experiences. Forest Garden is an absolute gem and, coupled with David’s gracious hospitality, it’s a stay that will be memorable for all the little details. If you’re looking for a place to get away from the hustle and bustle of city life to recharge and recenter, look no further. The grounds, the trails, the water features, the books, the art, the porch, the summer lightning bugs, and the beautifully designed kitchen all create a sense of zen and flow. It’s clear David has spent time in Asia, particularly Japan. I felt whisked back to Japanese ryokans during my stay. Thank you, David, for a wonderful experience!"
6532,100,"Julia, I’m grateful for the privilege to host you and others at Forest Garden."
6533,100,"This is a very special spot. Nestled in rich woods, it's as magical as you think it will be when you read the description. Located about halfway between Carrboro and Pittsboro, there's plenty to do nearby AND you feel like you're away from everything. David is extremely thoughtful and pays attention to little details that make things all that more comfortable. He's also a really nice person who checks in to make sure you're doing great and also provides you with plenty of privacy. Highly recommend this place!"
6534,100,"Many thanks, Justin, and I hope you make it back this way."
6535,101,"The scenery was absolutely beautiful and very peaceful and the stream was perfect. The dome was a really fun experience and you’re only about 20 mins to downtown Boone so we were able to explore and eat at a couple of great restaurants! Downtown Boone was so fun to explore and INCREDIBLY dog friendly, which was great!

The only thing I would say is that the dome was not supplied with plates or body wipes as advertised but there is a store about 15 minutes away to get anything you may need.

Also I wouldn’t say it is super private if someone is staying in the other dome. With the way the domes are positioned (one at the top of the hill and the other at the bottom) you are in direct view of each other. We could see into the other dome from our deck. Which is fine but just so you know what to expect!

Overall a great experience!!"
6536,101,Ideal for camping with for those with limited camping experience. Very peaceful.
6537,101,"My husband and I are from the area and used this trip as a little getaway prior to our first child being born. We are very outdoorsy and enjoy regular camping I’m not pregnant. With that being said, at this cost, this is not “glamping”. The dome was clean, dry and warm but offered little “amenities”. Two small battery powered lights hung from the ceiling (they were dead and no power cord provided) so we wore head lamps the whole time after sundown. It is advertised as “private” but is hardly so. We stayed during an “off season” so other guests were not staying on the property but other camp sites are <100 yards away from you along with some teepee huts. The porta johns were clean but a stones throw away from the dome, also. Being an experienced camper who isn’t afraid of the “outdoors” that was looking for a more up scale experience - this is nowhere near worth the cost. Owners are very nice and this was a good experience but the cost ($293 with air bnb fees - $116 without) is too much"
6538,101,The Getaway Dome was not too far from parking and the wagon they provided was helpful to get down the hill. It was very peaceful and quiet. We had a blast and the wood burning stove inside provided plenty of heat. Would definitely go back!
6539,101,"PLEASE!!!!! read this review to save yourself and the hosts peace of mind.

To simply get to the AirBnb your vehicle has to make it past a muddy (yet fun) driveway full off deep and big holes. My truck was a 2WD and used momentum as my best friend the whole way. A AWD vehicle w clearance would have so much fun and get there without a problem. Cars will NOT make it at all.

My girlfriend and I met up at the Airbnb and she drove her Honda civic sedan and we left it parked at the where the muddy driveway starts. Parked properly and waaaaay out of the way of the road to get to the Airbnb. Her car was going to get towed and there was NO WHERE to park it. We parked her car in a 24 hour parking garage in Boone (25 mins away)

Other than that it was an amaaaazing experience. Super fun and enjoyed the quiet and tranquility of the spot. Close to blue ridge parkway and grandfather mountain. Would definitely come back again with NO cars.

(I had so much fun on the muddy driveway lol)"
6540,101,Great place to relax!! 4 wheel drive helps for sure. The road coming in could be tricky if you don't know what your doing. Beautiful quiet and relaxing!! My daughter loved the bunk bed and the bed was very comfortable.
6541,101,"The best experience ever!!!! Can’t wait to go back!!

Definitely be sure to check in right at 4 or so especially with the time change. It’s difficult to get to the dome at night with the steep hill. That was on us though!!

It was beyond peaceful and just relaxing to unplug after the holidays!"
6542,101,"We do recommend arriving before dark, FOR SURE! Its just nice to get your bearings, though it is also nice to wake up the next morning to not knowing where you are or how beautiful it is! Unplug to recharge!"
6543,101,"First day we got clear instructions; Welcoming environment; no electricity but battery pack available to recharge small electronics with usb cable.
Close to the small stream with clear water.
From our experience, approximately 6 cubic feet of wood kept the dome warm through the night-Bring enough firewood. Barbecue grill outside, bring your charcoal if you plan on cooking.
Beautiful view of clear skies!"
6544,101,"Thanks for the visit - in your private feedback you mentioned us needing a swimming hole, if you keep going around the bend, toward our only neighbor's house, there are some deeper spots in there for cleaning off :)"
6545,101,Amazing stay!
6546,101,Absolutely stunning! We stayed as a trial to see if this could be something we would do again and absolutely loved it! Would recommend traveling there in a truck or SUB no cars. Little rocky on the back roads to get there and I would also recommend getting there before dark as it could be a little difficult to find in the dark. Other than that absolutely gorgeous will definitely be recommending and coming back many more times alone and with friends!! Can’t wait until our next trip!!
6547,101,"It was super peaceful and my dogs loved playing free in the creek! The dome was clean, the bed was super comfortable, and they provide most of what you need. Make sure you know how to use the tent stove properly if staying on a cold night! Also, I suggest you arrive during the day. The drive in is a bit rough and bumpy, but I’m from Florida and not familiar with driving on hilly backroads."
6548,101,Awesome Serenity! We loved waking up to the pure beauty of fall!
6549,101,"My husband, our pups and myself thoroughly enjoyed our glamping experience, cooking on the wood burning stove, cooking on the grill, watching the leaves fall, skipping rocks in the crystal clear creek. Bring your dogs they are welcome almost everywhere in Boone and surrounding areas. We went to 3 breweries, 3 waterfalls - Cascade falls, linville falls, Elk River falls and the Linville Caverns Everything was great.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND COMING DURNING THE FALL. JUST WOW!!!

FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS GIVEN TO YOU!!! They are super easy to follow and very clear. Communication with our host was great.

Walking your stuff up and down hill to your dome was alittle tough. I recommend having a back pack for each person staying but you walk along the creek it’s peaceful.

10/10 will stay again."
6550,101,"Loved our stay at glamping unplugged! Close to Boone and hiking on the Blue Ridge Parkway but still secluded! We loved the dome, hammock, and creek for our dogs to play in!"
6551,101,"We had a really excellent time Glamping! Overall, the host is super responsive to any questions, the dome was clean and comfortable, and the site was beautiful. Loved that you could see and hear the creek from the dome. Having a bed at the end of the day was fantastic :)

A few things to consider if this is your first time staying in this dome: it is a bit of a hike from the parking lot, which is also where the port-o-potty is located, to the dome. Packing as much as you can in backpacks will make things much easier, and having a portable camping toilet was a lifesaver for the middle of the night. We stayed right when the weather was starting to cool and noticed some condensation forming in the dome, so keeping our fire materials dry was a challenge. Even though we rarely use them in our other travels, a pack of quick start logs was really helpful.

Overall, we had a great time and would love to come back soon!"
6552,101,Perfect way to connect with nature
6553,101,"Our Glamping experience was wonderful and unique. If you are looking for a cool getaway in the woods, I would recommend this place. It has a creek running nearby that you can hear very well and fish in as well. The bed was reasonably comfortable. I absolutely recommend you use a vehicle with high clearance and maybe 4WD as the last stretch of road to the camp site is unpaved and contains many big potholes. Once you get to the campsite though, it's all worth it!"
6554,101,"’m a rough and tough camper so staying in a tent that is already set up and having a king size bed was nothing short of luxury to me and my husband. However, the listing stated a half bath and that turned out to mean a port-a- potty IN THE PARKING LOT and we were pretty far from it so it was inconvenient to wake my husband up in the middle of the night just to use the bathroom. And there was no showers or even a tap with fresh water to wash our dirty hands we ended up purchasing a week pass at a local gym just to shower. But like I said We are used to the ruffer style of camping but if you not this might not be for you.

The town of West Jefferson was such a quaint small town full of dog lovers and all around good people, highly recommend you to visit especially if you have a fur baby. The Host were very prompt at answering messages and overall this was a much need break from our fast moving lives and highly recommended"
6555,101,This is a great way to camp. Loved the location right on the stream. Very peaceful and beautiful. The dome itself can get a lot of condensation build up and isn’t a breathable structure so I definitely recommend spending as much time outside for the fresh air. It was well maintained and a great getaway.
6556,101,"I would stay here again! Great for time away to nature-bathe and connect as a family or spend quiet time alone. My kids enjoyed playing in the creek (we came in August). They also loved the sleeping area and the toys they provide. I would definitely bring some extra toys and games for kids though.

The porto-potty was a bit far to walk to at night so I would recommend a camping toilet with bags for night time use. Otherwise the toilets were clean and we had no problem using them throughout the day.
Bring extra wipes and paper products, just nice to have for frequent cleanups or hand washing.

The battery charger they provide was charged and we were able to use it for two nights without it running out. We also had our own backup battery just in case.

They provide two lanterns, but I would definitely bring more light for nighttime. If you’re staying longer than two night, I would bring a solar light strand for the deck and the bunk bed area (that part was a little dark on a cloudy day).

Bring rain coats and mud boots/shoes!

We had cell service for calls and text and internet, but like they suggest, unplug and enjoy nature!"
6557,101,"Great stay, beautiful view."
6558,101,"This is about as comfortable as nature gets! The scenery was amazingly peaceful, and just the kind of retreat our family needed as our kids got into the “back to school” mode. Our favorite part was the proximity to the creek. And the parents especially appreciated having a comfy bed!!"
6559,101,"So fun!!!!! Road in is no joke though. Deep pot holes and steep. Followed their directions they posted and not my phone map so no problem finding it.
It is glamping but I suggest bringing all your camping items minus the tent and tarps - they have items left behind from other guest then their own fans and battery pack. Also absolutely no stores around so make sure when you come in you have your food and wood- it’ll add time to drive back to those things. Walk to tent is steep as well so I would suggest only guest who can handle a decent walk on rocky terrain. They have a wagon to help you get your stuff down which was great.
Location can’t be beat for being secluded and the river right outside the door. So fun to wake up in the trees. Felt safe. Quick responses too!"
6560,101,Fun stay!
6561,101,"Decent little place, just make sure to bring all necessities you may need"
6562,101,"This is a great option to get your family outdoors any time of year. The creek was a serene background to our stay. We enjoyed the surrounding areas of Boone, Blowing Rock, and the parks nearby."
6563,101,Unplugged Fleetwood is beautiful. The dome is in a ravine so it's well shaded and not overly hot mid summer. From our dome we could not see or hear the other unless outside and intentionally looking that way. The river was gorgeous and everything kept very clean for an outdoor set up.
6564,101,"Had a great stay very serene!
Location is very beautiful and had everything we needed.
Recommend bringing an AWD vehicle to this location the roads were a bit challenging especially if it’s raining or snowing. There is another Glamping dome near by so you’re not totally private just FYI."
6565,101,"We loved our glamping trip! To escape the hot weather we made a last-minute trip to the mountains and this was the perfect pick. We loved the privacy of being the only dome down by the stream. It was great to relax on the hammock, sit in the rocking chairs by the fire, and then get a great nights sleep in a comfy bed. A few small hanging battery powered lanterns are provided, but bringing your own definitely also helps. Also, since we visited in June, bringing some battery powered fans would’ve helped cool things off earlier in the evening. We had a hard time with the battery pack provided and could only get it to charge devices with lightning cords, but it could’ve been user error. Overall, we had a great stay!"
6566,101,Our stay was amazing! Very easy to understand the directions given. The location was absolutely beautiful and just what we needed to get away!
6567,101,"Some of the items specified to be there, were not there. However, I went out to Walmart (35 min) away purchased the items (cleaning wipes/pots/pans/grill utensils & accessories/lanterns that work) and left them there for the next visitors. #payitforward

I also went ahead and cleaned outside the dome (windows) b/c they were completely covered w/ leaves/dirt/sticks etc. so you couldn’t see out, which ultimately ended up being a waste of my time, b/c you are completely engulfed in trees/leave coverage anyhow. There is really no view to be had at this location during the spring / summer months.

All I can say whoever took the pictures for this AirBNB did an amazing job. It looks beautiful, but in reality it is not. Hats off to the photographer seriously!

The overall experience was good. Host was very informative, but they clearly weren’t aware that none of the items stated to be present, were in fact not present or not working properly.
Regardless, it was good time w/ great company, fun outdoor excursions (gem stone hunting/hiking/rock climbing), but to sum it up in two words, #FalseAdvertising.

I will not be returning, I believe there is far better locations out there for the cost."
6568,101,Love the place! Even the off-road drive to get there was fun.. definitely recommended 👍🏻
6569,101,The location is excellent and the dome was super clean. We loved our stay and so did our three kids and dog. We left feeling refreshed and connected.
6570,101,We had an amazing two nights here. Being so close to the creek was everything. We truly unplugged. The kids didnt even ask for their electronics. Success!! Our pup had a great time to. We will definately be back.
6571,101,Such a great spot and a nice break from my normal tent experience. Falling asleep to the sound of the creek was exactly what I needed. Would highly recommend to all nature lovers
6572,101,"Good location, however I messaged the owners about not being able to find the lock box (we found it) and they still have not read the message."
6573,101,Very great experience. Being by the river gave it a peaceful feel!
6574,101,"10/10 would stay here again! So quiet, so peaceful, so clean and well kept!"
6575,101,A must!!! Make it a bucket list item!
6576,101,Very pretty place to enjoy the nature. Very Beautiful in the morning! Do not follow Google maps and make sure to check in during the day time. The lockbox is a little bit hard to use
6577,101,My wife and I enjoyed it.
6578,101,Amazing experience! So peaceful and relaxing! The only way I’ll ever camp in the future! The creek provides the Most calming sounds! Although the bed is so comfortable and the glamp tent doesn’t feel like camping- it’s definitely still camping. No plumping or electrical so be prepared to cook/grill over a fire or charcoal! No sinks to wash up in and no bathhouses to shower. Overall it was a wonderful experience.
6579,101,Beautiful space! Loved it and would come back again. Creek right out side. A beautiful trail walk to the dome. Great clamping experience.
6580,101,"A fun getaway. The hosts are great at communicating. The space is just what the pictures show - an idyllic getaway. The road to the site was bumpy and pot-holey in early May, so you may want to make sure you have a 4x4 even outside of winter months. This spot is definitely worth checking out if you want to camp but have a few amenities."
6581,101,Absolutely beautiful! Would highly recommend especially if you love nature!
6582,101,"Perfect, amazing for couples and family’s!!"
6583,101,Great getaway to unplug from life and phone calls and focus on yourself or each other... So peaceful and relaxing and definitely out alone to yourself!
6584,101,"Great stay, beautiful location! We will definitely be back in the warmer months. We suggest bringing 4 wheel drive to get to the location, especially if it’s rained or it’s been cold. Can’t wait to come back!"
6585,101,Very cool location and unique glamping experience! Geodome was warm and inviting!
6586,101,Beautiful property. A nice place to get away
6587,101,Stunning scenery and a wonderful secret getaway! My pups had so much fun exploring the area. The Dome was clearly built by someone who takes pride in their work. Very clean and comfortable. If going in the winter season-pack warm! The mornings can be a bit chilly while getting the wood oven started. We definitely will be returning!
6588,101,"I was excited for our visit, but unfortunately I had a goat emergency the “day of” check in. I gave 5 stars due to the fact that the owner immediately responded and and had human understanding. I look forward to “glamping” there in the near future."
6589,101,such an amazing get away place !!
6590,101,Great glamping experience!
6591,101,We stayed with our Golden Retriever. The host does a great job providing a great a experience. I would recommend taking a 4x4 or a car with some ground clearance if visiting after it rained. The road was a bit muddy and almost got stuck. I would definitely recommend staying here. Host provided firewood for campfire and stove top heater. The dome was very clean as well.
6592,101,"If you’re thinking about doing it, just do it. It was a trek getting there, but a thousand times worth it. We had the most amazing time and we’re already planning days to rebook this summer. The perfect secluded, unplugged mountain getaway."
6593,101,"Beautiful place, perfect to disconnect from the world, enjoy with family and create the best memories."
6594,101,"Super cool experience, would definitely recommend staying. Although it doesn’t say anywhere how rough the terrain is especially if it has rained… luckily we had an suv but if you were to try and drive a regular car you would have not made it. It took us a few tries to get up steep hills and through the mud. The directions were clear, communication was great, and the views were perfect."
6595,101,"Perfect place for a relaxing weekend. We’re already planning a trip back!

Side note: a truck or 4-wheel drive is very beneficial for getting in and out!"
6596,101,"What a weekend! My husband and I took our two dogs for the weekend in early March. Everything we needed (and more) was provided. Know that the mountains are always colder than predicted. We brought a camping stove and our camping shower and honestly we could have stayed a month! My husband even caught a few trout. The area is so private, we didn’t hear so much as a neighboring dog barking. 10/10"
6597,101,Great place to escape and unwind for a few days!
6598,101,"Wow! Wow! Wow! Super cool trip. The dome was a very unique experience… It was right on the water so we heard the creek all night long. The stars looked like you could reach up and touch them. The surrounding area of the dome was beautiful and well-maintained. If you’re going in the winter, research how to use a wood-burning stove. Make sure that you have an all wheel drive because the roads are super intense but pretty fun to drive on if you know how. The Porta potties were clean and well maintained. They’ve thought of everything you can imagine and made arrangements to make it as smooth as possible."
6599,101,"Beautiful location, very well maintained tent. Had an amazing time! Like the other reviews mentioned, you thought about every single necessity of the guests. Thoroughly enjoyed the stay and will definitely come back!"
6600,101,"Beautiful remote glamping. Drive and directions are easy, check in easy and the views on creek are amazing. Would recommend reading up on a wood burning stove but can’t beat this experience."
6601,101,We had a fantastic time during our stay! The dome is cozy and wonderful and offered a perfect little getaway. The property is very private and relaxing. I just wish we could have stayed longer!
6602,101,Had the best experience here. It was so fun and my dogs had a blast roaming around the property and creek! Definitely bring extra blankets and firewood. 10/10 would recommend for a relaxing get away!
6603,101,Beautiful location and exactly what I was hoping for with my first dome camping experience!
6604,101,So incredible!
6605,101,Very good place !
6606,101,"This is the place if you are looking for privacy, majestic beauty and the sounds of running water with tons of amenities!! This dome stayed so warm(bring your own extra wood) and the bed was beyond comfortable! The built in net hammock is great and hiking the waterfront is serious God country! The owners are communicative, kind and so helpful! I drove an hour out of my way to stay here and I will be back for sure!!!!"
6607,101,"I love camping but my wife isn't so hot for it but she absolutely loved our stay. It was a great compromise you get the camping elements but you get to go to sleep on a king size bed. It was a getaway we needed and the disconnect from everyday distractions gave us some one on one time we haven't had in some time. It was a bit of a rediscovery for us as a couple. A dip or at least a cat bath in the stream in the morning is absolutely invigorating. The cold water is energizing and it is a must do. If you are concerned about meals there is no worries there. You can hop in the car and you will be in downtown West Jefferson in 10 short minutes where there is several great places to eat and grab an adult beverage if you choose. So go ahead and book it, you won't regret it."
6608,101,"Perfect for our relationship get better heal heart ! That helped our relationship without WiFi and No tv. Just workout together cook, fire pit and chat lots also take tons of photo and drone too ! This is owner is professional, communication as well quickly, easygoing ! Definitely come back again !"
6609,101,"We loved our stay! Such a unique experience. So secluded and peaceful, yet nice and very well-kept."
6610,101,This was an awesome experience. Definitely bring extra blankets and firestarters for the winter months. Prepared to be blown away by the view of the stars at night!!
6611,101,"The stay was great! This was the first time experiencing a dome and glamping! Would love to stay during warmer weather and spend more time outdoors.

Be sure to bring everything you will need for your stay as the nearest town is a drive.

If you’re staying during the winter months, brush up your wood stove operations to stay warm throughout the night."
6612,101,Amazing stay! Easy check in. Great communication. We were looking for a day away from home in the mountains but with a more comfortable sleep than throwing a tent in the car. We couldn’t have asked for a better stay! Would highly recommend and will definitely be back.
6613,101,"If you're looking for a unique getaway, this is the perfect place! We did exactly what their philosophy says...we unplugged. We basically took our teens hostage, leaving their cellphones at home, and headed for the mountains to reconnect as a family sans the constant distraction of their phones and social media. We didn't want to take them to another fancy hotel and entertain them with some activity nearby; we wanted them to get out of their comfort zone and come back to reality. One night probably wasn't enough; but when it was all said and done, they really enjoyed the experience! Parents....do this with your kids! It's what the universe orders!

The dome was perfectly equipped with what we would need for glamping. It's super modern and clean and over-the-top cozy, which says a lot when you're in a place with no water or electricity! I can't wait to go back when it's warmer because the little stream that runs nearby is beautiful and we'd love to do some trout fishing. We woke up to 29 degrees on Sunday morning, but having the indoor woodburning stove made sleeping very comfortable. And the leaves had all fallen so we fell asleep gazing up at a dark sky full of millions of stars. It was incredibly peaceful and tranquil.

This was a very last-minute stay for us (same day request) and the owners made it incredibly easy with their great communication and wealth-of-information FAQ sheet that helps prepare you for what you need and what you don't need. This place won't disappoint!"
6614,103,"Excellent response time, beautiful location, well stocked linens, thoughtful details"
6615,103,We loved Topsail! Condo had an excellent view of the beach and kitchen was nicely stocked. Joshua was so quick to respond to any of my questions. My family will definitely be going back.
6616,103,"Comfortable beds, great linens, towels and toilet paper. Everything you need in the kitchen and bathroom. Responsive host. Great water pressure in shower."
6617,103,"Out to Sea was just as advertised. Joshua was communicative even before we arrived, letting us know that there was some unexpected work happening on the beach. This is certainly a place that we would love to visit again."
6618,103,"I was super pleased with my accommodations and the attention I received from Joshua! Not only did our place look exactly as it does in the pictures, there were so many other details that weren’t listed, such as extra pots, pans, utensils, seasonings, etc., that I have never found in another Air BnB. Joshua was a wonderful host and so quick to respond to any and every question. He is so friendly and my stay was EXCELLENT! I can’t wait to come back and watch the dolphins again!"
6619,103,"We enjoyed our stay at ""Out to Sea"". Josh was a great host. Very responsive to questions, and gave very clear instructions for check in. Very comfortable place to stay and enjoy the beautiful beach.
Highly recommend."
6620,103,"Joshua’s place was a great place to stay on Topsail Island. Loved waking up to catch a sunrise and fall asleep to the sound of the waves. I was there during a cold spell in December and the heat worked great! Joshua was a superb host! Couldn’t ask for better check in instructions, was so easy to find his condo. Excellent communication throughout the entire process. Joshua is a wonderful host and the condo is perfect if looking for a beach getaway on Topsail."
6621,103,"We had a very pleasant and relaxing stay with a nice view of the beach. It was clear to see that the owners had recently upgraded the heating and cooling system as well as other equipment in the home. I wouldn’t be surprised if they continued to upgrade the experience for those that come after us. The hosts were polite, available, and helpful when we had questions. We would definitely stay here again."
6622,103,A nice little place to visit topsail.
6623,103,"Joshua lived up to the expectations based on all the positive feedback in the other reviews. Beautiful place, don’t hesitate!"
6624,103,"Great stay! We were in the area visiting a family member in the military at Camp Lejeune . We stayed the weekend and condo had all the amenities needed. It was great to sit on the porch with our coffee in the morning and take in the views. Easy access to the beach. Wonderful time looking for seashells and shark teeth during low tides. Hosts made it very easy to access entry, connect to WiFi etc. Joshua was very responsive!"
6625,103,"Wonderful stay. Great condo, right on the beach. Couldn’t have asked for more."
6626,103,"Out to Sea is a wonderfully roomy and inviting condo practically in the sand itself. It's location is simply fantastic. Warmly decorated and with many modern features, it was the perfect place for us to explore Topsail Island for the first time. The hosts not only provide detailed documentation of how to operate everything, but also a comprehensive recommendations for local things to do and see.
But the best part was how responsive Joshua was to our needs- he was always just a message away, if we had any questions or problems. A super-host indeed! We will definitely rent from this host again!"
6627,103,"This is the perfect beach getaway spot, to forget about your worklife for a few days and simply breathe!"
6628,103,"The condo was great, clean with a fantastic view right on the beach. Josh’s communication was amazing! We would definitely book with him again"
6629,103,"Perfect for us three ladies. Right on the beach. We were there during Hurricane Ian. So we stayed inside one day all day. Storm was amazing to watch and TV provided all we needed during that time. Beds comfortable. Kitchen fully stocked with all you will need. Tiki bar across street. Joshua very responsive with questions. If you want on the beach, this is your place."
6630,103,"Joshua is wonderful. So quick to respond, and helpful. Even questions about the locale were answered, and he didnt leave anything out if the welcome guide.( thats what im calling it )All the info you need isbright there handy. This is a beautiful place, fully stocked, right by the ocean. Plus its a great value for the size. I am so excited to come back with our whole family."
6631,103,"Terrific host. Answered all questions quickly. Lovely,clean well stocked condo. Great location. Beautiful view. Peaceful and relaxing. We had a wonderful visit here."
6632,103,"If you want to be close to the beach, this is the condo! It is next to the beach and stocked with chairs, umbrellas and beach toys to enjoy a day at the beach. Communication with Joshua is easy and open. We enjoyed our time at the condo and hopefully will be back. Thank you."
6633,103,"Beautiful condo and very accomodating. Love how close it is to the water. Lots of board games, cookware, sand toys, beach chairs, and places to sleep. Felt very kid/family friendly. Joshua was very quick to respond to any questions, comments, or concerns I had. Would stay here again in the future!"
6634,103,"Excellent location, super clean Condo. Everything you need is there. Fast answering from Joshua always there if you need anything."
6635,103,"It was a great trip and we stayed on the right place. Even from the beginning, when I reserved this condo, Joshua was very fast answering my messages about general questions for our future stay at his place. He always replied within 30 minutes or less. And when we got to the condo, everything was clean and well maintained. I just enjoyed so much this trip and Joshua’s place was just the perfect spot for me and my friends. I would go back to this condo 100%"
6636,103,GREAT location! Nice setup with some unexpected amenities. However condo was humid and the AC units were loud.
6637,103,"Hi Jessica,

Thanks for the feedback. We have a new AC system scheduled for install in a few weeks. So sorry it wasn’t in place prior to your stay. Hope everything else was good!"
6638,103,Wonderful people and they answered messages promptly. They made our vacation very memorable. Thanks again 😁
6639,103,"Joshua was excellent with his communication at all times! I was surprised to see he supplied a few items i didn’t expect such as paper towels , cleaning supplies etc. The condo was very nice inside , well kept and clean.. My family thoroughly enjoyed our stay!!!"
6640,103,This was the perfect place for our family vacation. Had enough space for all 7 of us.
6641,103,Excellent stay and great spot. Loved the board games and beach access. Couldn’t ask for much more out of this little beach spot.
6642,103,"Joshua and Michael were great hosts. The condo is older so there are some aspects of that that are unavoidable, but they’ve done a great job making some updates. They have all the amenities you need to enjoy your stay: kitchen appliances/utensils, vacuums for the sand, beach toys/chairs, etc. They were excellent at communicating and very interested in making sure our needs were met and we were happy."
6643,103,"Excellent location. Nicely decorated, very clean, kitchen was fully stocked which was awesome! Bring your own beach towels and sand toys if you have kids. Overall great stay. Thank you, Joshua!"
6644,103,Great place and fantastic views. Close to shopping and dining as well. Would highly recommend.
6645,103,Many wow moments especially the first time you step into Michael and Joshua’s beach front condo. They have spent a lot of time on details on decorating and making sure their guests meet every need possible from cooking supplies to enough towels. They are very good at making sure they answer any questions you have. We would definitely stay there again! Get ready for a great beach experience!!
6646,103,"Host was super nice and accommodating. I did have some trouble with the door upon check-in but I’m convinced it was user error. Don’t try to hold handle while door is unlocking, wait for the click. ;) With that said, host was very quick to respond and stayed with us on the phone until we could get in. The space was very clean and the perfect spot for a peaceful getaway!"
6647,103,"This was hands down the best airbnb that i have ever stayed at. It started with excellent communication and continued until yhe last day. Every detail was taken care of. Simple toiletries were taken care of. There was coffee, sugar, dish soap..... all the little things were provided by the hosts. I highly recommended staying here and will be rebooking myself!!!!!"
6648,103,This was the perfect place for my family and I! We absolutely loved it and can’t wait to go back!
6649,103,"This condo is ideally located on the beach, super clean, nicely appointed, logically organized, many thoughtful touches. Highly recommended!"
6650,103,it is very clean and new
6651,103,Loved this place. Only steps to the beach and Joshua was very responsive to any questions I had! I would definitely stay here again.
6652,103,Great hosts! Very responsible and beautiful place to stay. Highly recommend everything!
6653,103,"This condo is perfect. Excellent location, super clean, and the owners are beyond helpful down to the last detail."
6654,103,"Very clean, and the location can't be beat. Looks just like the pictures. Especially enjoyed the great view of the ocean and the direct beach access. Had everything we needed. We loved it."
6655,103,Great location super friendly definitely recommending this place. Great for kids and feels right at home.
6656,103,"We had an amazing stay! We stayed here for spring break and to see our Marine who is stationed at Camp Lejeune.

It was chilly, so we enjoyed hanging out on the deck looking at the beach, and we could hear the waves crashing in the main bedroom. The building’s stairs to the sand are are impacted by high tide, but that was easy to work around.

The beds were very comfortable, and the rain shower was luxurious. The kitchen is well-equipped for cooking meals. There is also plenty of seating in the living area.

Our stay was perfect, and we can’t wait to come back!"
6657,105,Me & my children enjoyed spring break at this beautiful and peaceful cabin. Equipped with everything needed ! Sunset/sunrise was everything !! Although getting up the mountain was a challenge (the kids enjoyed the laugh 🙄😂) . We had a great time ! And will def book again !
6658,105,Nick and Patrick have done a great job with this airb&b! The view is great! It’s super close to the little town of Franklin and they give great restaurant recommendations! The place was clean and had everything we needed. Highly recommend staying here.
6659,105,Nice place
6660,105,Great!
6661,105,Loved my stay and would highly recommend.
6662,105,I brought my girlfriend and it was incredible they host and the cleaning service got together decorated the entire home for her birthday. She was in tears and I really appreciate them for the hospitality and time they took out to do me that huge favor. If this host have any other location I would only like to both through them. I always use Airbnb when traveling and this is my favorite experience and accommodation I ever had. I give this a 20/10. Ps. You definitely need a truck or something that can fight through rocks and mud to reach this bnb.
6663,105,Property though was nice and clean
6664,105,"Patrick’s place was exactly as pictured, private and dreamy. My partner and I spent two nights here and had wished it was longer! The space is beautiful and the views are breathtaking. Like any cabin it’s a trek up, so make sure your vehicle is capable. The jacuzzi, fire pit, and grill were great touches and are what made us select this property! The jacuzzi could use a cleaning, but otherwise was enjoyable. Also the recommendations provided were helpful, we drove about 30 minutes out to Glen Falls and saw 3 additional waterfalls on the drive over. Overall great stay, I would love to return with a group!"
6665,105,"We had a wonderful time at Patrick's cabin! Everything was as pictured and described. We loved the beautiful view, hot tub, and fully stocked kitchen. The cabin was also close to downtown Franklin, which was great. Would love to stay here again."
6666,105,"Couldn’t have loved this space more. It was perfectly in between downtown Franklin and downtown Highlands with such beautiful surroundings. I absolutely loved that they had a book of things to do around town, but also gave instructions on any questions you would have. The drive up the mountain was definitely wild but it made coming home more of an adventure. We stayed in the house a lot, and it was a great space to relax. We will definitely be booking this cabin again!"
6667,105,"While we had a lovely time in Patricks’s home, there were a few issues with some of the amenities. Thankfully Patrick was quick to address the issues and make up for it! Overall, the home is a dream vacation spot for a mountain getaway."
6668,105,"Very nice place, host was always responsive in a timely manner"
6669,105,"This cabin was great. It was everything that was described. Have to echo the bit about 4x4 and steep road. Only “issue” was a tree fell on the road right before the cabin, but Patrick was quick to call someone and in no time someone with a chainsaw showed up and moved the tree! Would totally recommend this to anyone looking to get away for a few days in quiet with great views of the mountains."
6670,105,"Super amazing host, very beautiful home with an amazing view. Had lot of fun and was able to enjoy the house. Definitely recommend for a nice and peaceful vacation !"
6671,105,"Our stay at this AirBnb was wonderful! The home is very cute, cozy, and secluded. The hot tub was super nice and there is even a curtain on the side of the deck for extra privacy. The beds were very comfortable and the showers were fairly big and clean. The hosts also recommend we go over to Highlands. It is only 30 minutes from Franklin and there are 3 or 4 gorgeous waterfalls we stopped at on the way. There are lots of shops and restaurants there we enjoyed like The Ugly Dog Pub. I do want to note that the driveway is very steep. That is mentioned in the description but we are not from the mountains so we weren’t quite prepared for how steep it was going to be. It wasn’t an issue, but I would not recommend driving up it in a very large vehicle or one that lacks 4WD/AWD. Overall it was a great stay, my 3 friends and I really enjoyed both the AirBnb as well as Franklin and the towns around it. I highly recommend!"
6672,105,"Let me first start off saying Patrick was an amazing host! Property was pristine!! I’m a real estate broker in NC and it definitely felt like it was a staged show home! Then when I read the welcome packet in the kitchen I found out he’s an agent as well, lol makes sense!

Had a minor issue with the hotub and they were literally out to fix it in 15 minutes, I wasn’t expecting them that quickly. Overall it was a wonderful experience and would highly recommend!"
6673,105,The place was amazing and it was a great little getaway thanks to you
6674,105,"Amazing cabin! We had such a great time. The views are beautiful. Extremely comfy beds and the most equipped air bnb kitchen I’ve ever experienced. Big hot tub that we spent half of our time in.

Just a quick drive to downtown Franklin and waterfalls.

Four wheel drive is a must.

Only two cons: the fireplace was not working (though they let us know a day before we arrived) and you have to drive your trash down the mountain to a waste disposal company who wouldn’t recycle our recyclables."
6675,105,"Perfect mountain weekend getaway! Very cozy, updated and clean home. Has everything you could need. Highly recommend!"
6676,105,"Beautiful property with an amazing view! From firepit to hot tub to the endless blankets, they had everything you need to stay cozy in the cold season!"
6677,105,"Really nice cabin! Loved all the touches throughout. Super clean, comfortable and stocked with additional towels and toiletries."
6678,105,"Beautiful views from the decks and out the large windows, the cabin makes for a really nice stay.
Do heed the warning about the drive up to the cabin, it’s a steep one!
The accommodations and recommendations are awesome!!"
6679,105,Incredible A-Frame at the top of a mountain. Place was well-kept and the little details really added to an overall great experience. Has everything you need from coffee and kitchen wares to a hot tub and extra linens and blankets. Would stay here again.
6680,105,Amazing place!
6681,105,"This place was everything we wanted in a Smoky Mountain getaway for the fall leaves! Perfect views from both decks, cozy spaces, great cooking kitchen, and so close to many great hikes. We'd happily come back again!"
6682,105,My wife and I had a wonderful time on our honeymoon in this A-frame cabin! Thoroughly enjoyed the view from the balcony and from the hot tub. We were a bit disappointed that the fireplace was not functioning while we were there we were not notified in advance that there would be a problem with it. But overall or stay there was wonderful. The wonderful views and the peaceful quaint town of Franklin were absolutely wonderful to visit. All-wheel drive or four-wheel drive vehicle is very much needed for this location.
6683,105,"Gorgeous views and great decor. You definitely need a four wheel drive or SUV/truck to get up the driveway, even in the summer, car wouldn’t work. Overall great experience, I’ll be back!"
6684,105,This is a great place to stay to enjoy the mountains of WNC. The views of the mountains and cabin are outstanding. This place ticks every box for a mountain getaway.
6685,105,"This cabin was perfect for the relaxing mountain getaway we were looking for. It was clean, comfortable, cozy, and beautiful inside and out. We especially loved having the gas fire pit outside and wood burning fire place inside. The views are incredible, and we sat outside for hours every day just soaking them in underneath a blanket. We chose this cabin because we knew we would be staying inside and relaxing for a lot of our trip, so we wanted something cozy and comfortable, and it did not disappoint."
6686,105,Property matched everything I expected and had an absolutely fantastic view!
6687,105,"Beautiful home exactly how it appeared in the pictures the view was really the best! would definitely recommend to everyone, the stay was awesome everything was perfect! The host was great at communicating and answering questions made it really easy for us to check in. Definitely recommend"
6688,105,"This was by far the best Airbnb experience we’ve ever had! The property and the view are 10/10. The house was beautiful and had everything we needed. Fire pit, grill and hot tub enhanced the weekend as well. Location is amazing. The drive to highlands is under 30 min and on a gorgeous road. All 3 bedrooms are awesome and the decks are great for hanging out. A frame design is stunning. Can’t wait to stay here again."
6689,105,"Beautiful mountain A-frame with Million Dollar View! Spacious, clean, comfortable and stylish. Great location - close to waterfalls, scenic drives, mountain hiking and restaurants. A pivotal role in one of our most enjoyed vacations ever! Recommended to numerous family, friends and coworkers. Plan to come again and again. Thank you for great southern hospitality."
6690,105,Beyond all expectations!! STELLAR!!! Pictures do not tell the whole story.
6691,105,This A frame house is hard to beat for a relaxing weekend getaway. It is very secluded and peaceful. The pictures perfectly portrayed the beauty of this house.
6692,105,"Beautiful view! Private, comfortable, very clean, nice decor, great attention to detail. We will be back!"
6693,105,"Very beautiful clean cabin with exquisite views of the mountains . This place is very nice, has everything you need and a HOTTUB! We were made to feel right at home."
6694,105,"Great A-frame house to get away and relax in! The views were incredible and the house had everything we needed. Franklin is a cute town with great restaurants and interesting shops to explore downtown. Overall our trip was excellent and if you're looking for a getaway experience with comfort and amazing views, this is the place for you."
6695,105,"This place is fantastic, super clean and great cabin with a phenomenal view. The hosts are very friendly and respond quickly. We felt very welcome and super comfortable during our stay!"
6696,105,Patrick’s place was perfect for a secluded getaway! The house was literally stocked with every thing you need and was very clean! The area was very quiet and only one close neighbor near by. The only obstacle I had was getting to the property in my Dodge Journey. I did get stuck a couple times. The best advice to give is to go up the hill without stopping or going to slow if you do not have 4WD. I would def recommend this place and would love to stay again!
6697,105,Thanks for staying with us Alexsis glad to hear you enjoyed your stay. We do clearly state within the listing multiple times that a 4WD or AWD vehicle is strongly recommended due to the grade of the road up to the cabin. Unfortunate to receive a review based on this information but glad you were eventually able to make it up the road!
6698,105,"Amazing view, wonderfully clean space, solid internet, great hosts with quick communication. Would definitely recommend!"
6699,106,Great location and great host. I'm looking forward to coming back.
6700,106,Thanks Warren! You were a great guest! We'd love to have you back any time!
6701,106,There are no words except for breathtaking . Amazing views and the Dome was perfect
6702,106,Thank you Amber! We're so glad you had a nice stay in your Dome and enjoyed that awesome view!
6703,106,Great vacation spot! Pics don’t do it justice!
6704,106,Thank you Erica! It was our pleasure to host you! We're so happy you had a great time!
6705,106,Wonderful visit and spectacular views! Would love to come back for another visit.
6706,106,Thank You so much Ben! We would LOVE to have you back!
6707,106,Enjoyed our stay! Great views and hiking trails on the property! Everything was as advertised!
6708,106,Thanks Grant! We are glad you enjoyed the views as well as the trails! Come back anytime.
6709,106,"We really enjoyed our stay at the dome. The dome was spacious for 2 people with a great shower and gorgeous views.

Every message I sent to Matt received a prompt response from him. The location is great in terms of places to eat and grocery store.

Matt was a great host and we will definitely return to this place."
6710,106,Thank You Ami! We loved hosting you! Come back soon please and please be our guest.
6711,106,"Everything was nice. Bed was comfortable, towels were soft and thick. Beautiful, clean dishes. Everything we needed supplied. Beautiful views. Instructions on how to use things. Very specific. Never had to speak to anyone and all information needed was given in advance. Never ran into any problems. Very impressed with quality of all items."
6712,106,Thank you Toddra for the wonderful review! We’re so happy that you enjoyed your stay on the mountain and we hope that you come back soon!!
6713,106,Amazing ! Would stay again !!
6714,106,Thanks Mattalyn! We'd love to have you back!
6715,106,A perfect getaway weekend
6716,106,Thank You Amanda! We really enjoyed hosting you! Please come back and stay with us soon!
6717,106,"Great place to get away and rewind. I truly enjoyed this spot and would easily return for another stay! I recommend checking in before night, it’s the mountains."
6718,106,Thank You for being a wonderful guest! So glad you enjoyed our mountain! We would love to have you back!
6719,106,"Wow! What a great place to stay. We enjoyed the hiking, seclusion from the city, and how responsive our host was. We will be back!"
6720,106,Thanks Jordan! We'd love to have you to come back and stay with us! Come back this summer when everything is green!
6721,106,Beautiful place to stay. We will be back!
6722,106,Thank you Angela! We'd love to have you back any time!
6723,106,"Great stay, awesome location."
6724,106,Thanks Finn! We are glad you enjoyed the Dome and had a great trip!
6725,106,"We really enjoyed our stay. The setting was beautiful and the location was great for visiting the park, Asheville and other spots on the Blue Ridge Parkway. 100% would come back. Thanks for a great stay!"
6726,106,We 100% want you to come back and stay with us! Come back this summer when everything is green!
6727,106,"Place was beautiful, the view of the mountains from the dome, we were in was spectacular. You do have to walk up to your Dome, no front parking. Other than that this place is amazing and it’s worth the money to experience."
6728,106,Thank You so much Adrian! Come try a glass cabin next time! If you choose the accessible unit- the parking is right in front! Thank You for being wonderful guests!
6729,106,"Amazing!! We loved everything about staying in the dome! It was just as beautiful as the photos. Gorgeous mountains views. Loved the fire pit and grills outside to cook dinner! Matt & the Glamping Team sent everything we needed for instructions including information about the winter storm that came in our second night there. Even with freezing rain, lots of harsh wind and some snow the dome stayed so warm and cozy! Everything was perfect!! Can’t wait to come back. Thank you so much!!"
6730,106,Andrea! We are blushing reading your incredible review! We would love to see you again soon- perhaps this summer when the mountain is every shade of green?
6731,106,Beautiful and serene
6732,106,Thank You! Blushing! See you again soon!
6733,106,This place was absolutely gorgeous. The views alone are worth the trip but then tie in the elegance and peace of being on top of the mountain and it’s surreal. Great on site amenities and Matt was extremely fast getting back to us with any questions we may of had. I recommend this to everyone that loves the outdoors!
6734,106,Come back soon Joshua! Loved having you here!
6735,106,Matt was incredibly responsive and the dome was exactly how it looks in the pictures! Beautiful views and the dome has everything you need for a great weekend. 10/10 recommend.
6736,106,Julia we think you are a 10/10!!! Please come back next season when the mountain is green and the wild flowers are in bloom.
6737,106,Such an awesome visit!! Highly recommend this beautiful spot.
6738,106,"Wow! What an amazing escape this was. My wife, child and my self had a very relaxing getaway. The space feel extremely private and the view was spectacular. Book now and thank us later. Thank you Matt for an amazing stay. :)"
6739,106,We loved our stay in the glamping dome! Was a great experience and we will definitely be back. Nothing can beat waking up to that view!
6740,106,Awesome getaway!
6741,106,Amazing place! Will def be back.
6742,106,We would highly recommend the glamping domes and plan to return for another visit! You can tell there was a lot of thought put into the accommodations and entire property. We made use of the gas grills and community fire pit. Everything you need is provided for you. The views were also amazing. Well done!
6743,106,Great place to get away especially if you live in the city
6744,106,We really enjoyed our stay! The geo dome was just like the pictures and was tucked away so you could really escape into nature. Our favorite part by far was watching the sunrises/sunsets. My only advice for anyone interested in booking is to make sure when you first arrive there is still daylight. Even with their very clear instructions you forget how dark nature can be. We had a blast and are planning to come back again!
6745,106,Was an outstanding guest! Absolutely wonderful! We would be quite happy to host again in a heartbeat! In any season on the mountain.
6746,106,It was a great get away from the hustle and bustle. Would stay again
6747,106,"A wonderful getaway with gorgeous views and cozy accommodations. Matt was a great host, he was very communicative and helpful. He even went out of his way to overnight valuable items that we left behind back to us. We highly recommended staying here!"
6748,106,"Great stay, very peaceful. For sure will comeback in the summer."
6749,106,"We had an amazing time! The hiking trails are easily accessible from the property and the views are fantastic! We especially enjoyed grilling and hanging out by the campfire at night. The unit is so cozy and is the perfect size for a couple and a dog.

There was a lot of fog the night we arrived and it was difficult to locate the Glamping Collective as well as our unit due to the low visibility. Would highly recommend arriving during the day time if you can."
6750,106,"Our stay was absolutely perfect. The dome was clean and comfortable, with gorgeous views and surroundings. The bed was extremely comfortable, sheets were soft, and pillows were perfect. We will absolutely be back!"
6751,106,We're so glad to hear that you had a comfortable stay! We look forward to having you back!
6752,106,"We stayed in dome 17 and it was perfect, exactly as pictured. The views and surrounding areas are even better than in person! If this is available do not hesitate book immediately. We will definitely be back!!"
6753,106,"Great cozy spot, remote and fun drive up the mountains!"
6754,106,"We came up to spend our six year anniversary here! The dome itself was beautiful and so unique. Not to mention the trails that provided amazing views! Such a beautiful experience and we made wonderful memories on top of the Sunset Trail because it was the spot for him to ask for my hand in marriage. 10/10 recommend, especially if you want to propose!"
6755,106,Congratulations Tabitha on your engagement! We're so excited for you and I can't think of anywhere better to get engaged than the top of Sunset Summit Trail! Can't wait to welcome you back for your honeymoon or future anniversaries!
6756,106,"My husband and I spent a weekend for our 25th anniversary. Our first time “glamping” and we were amazed!! He didn’t even miss having a TV! We were in dome 16 and the pictures posted are exactly what the dome looks like. The bed and pillows were so comfy! The views are gorgeous and you can just stay in bed and enjoy the mountain view. Communication was so easy and response time was almost immediate. Matt has done a fantastic job of ensuring privacy, although other domes are near. Just such a a great weekend. Location is 25 minutes from the Biltmore so we did a candlelight tour there. The driveway up is steep with gravel but my Rogue didn’t have any issues. Thanks again for a great stay!"
6757,106,"Congratulations on your 25th anniversary, what an amazing celebration! So glad you first glamping experience exceeded your expectations and hopefully the no TV led to a little extra ""us time""!"
6758,106,"This place was great. Very cozy inside and the view from bedroom was spectacular. In the morning you’d see the view change hour by hour as the sun came up, when it rained the sound was very soothing. On a clear night you’d see the stars perfectly laying in bed above you. The bed was very comfortable, big bathroom and kitchen had everything you needed for a meal and coffee or tea. Dome was very comfortable temperature even in colder nights the heater worked great.
The summit hike on property was very nice and worth the view! The fire pit area has everything you need to make fires and grill food.
Host very responsive, we even had a water issue and they notified us immediately and fixed it promptly.
The location was nice and the town had everything very convenient to get to with easy access to highway going whichever direction you needed.
Overall I had a great trip and I’m looking forward to coming back and visiting my new spot Dome #17!"
6759,106,Thanks Micki for staying with us and so glad you had such an amazing experience! The star gazing is one our favorite things as well- I've never seen so many shooting stars as you do up there at night on the mountain! We look forward to welcoming you back soon!
6760,106,It was a perfect stay!!
6761,106,Thanks so much for staying with us Yongsuk! So glad you had an amazing stay!
6762,106,Beautiful views and the hospitality was great.
6763,106,Thanks Meagan! So glad you enjoyed the views and appreciate your feedback on our hospitality! We look forward to welcoming you back soon!
6764,106,"Absolutely amazing experience. I had the pleasure of staying in a dome as well as the glass house. Both are wonderful. You cannot go wrong either way, both are aesthetically pleasing. Each have all the essentials you need from cooking needs to towels, I felt the attention to detail was top notch! I would highly suggest the hot tub. The location has a lot right at the bottom of the mountain such as grocery stores and restaurants, extremely convenient. As far as getting up the mountain we rented a Jeep 4x4 but a lot of visitors were able to get up the mountain just fine in a car. I am happy we played it safe and rented a Jeep I could not imagine attempting this in a car if the weather isnt right. My spouse and I can’t wait to come back!"
6765,106,"My husband & I spent a weekend getaway at the Glamping Collective and it was truly an incredible stay, we even had a gorgeous dusting of snow on our check out day. The views were absolutely breathtaking and the aesthetic of the dome itself was 10/10. The Airbnb was clean and the grounds were well kept.

There’s plenty to do near by, but honestly the dome is so amazing you will not want to leave.

We highly recommend checking out Shoji Spa & Retreat (about 25 minutes away), The Asheville Pinball museum, Biltmore Estates, & the adorable downtown area of Waynesville."
6766,106,"Stunning views!!! My husband and I stayed here for our anniversary and we have no regrets!!! Definitely listen to the recommendation for a good car to get up to your destination as I’m sure in colder/freezing weather it can be dangerous. We have no complaints and were so pleased with our stay. The bed was very comfortable, everything was clean and welcoming. So happy with the location, being so close to nature but also the convenience of the city not too far away. Love love love!!!

Can’t wait to come back!!!"
6767,106,Great host. Everything was exactly as described. Great value and perfect place for peace and quiet and an incredible view both day and night. Will definitely go back in the future
6768,106,Absolutely amazing!!
6769,106,The Glamping Collective was an extraordinary experience for us newly weds! My husband and I enjoyed hiking the property and the dome accommodations were spectacular! It was relaxing and invigorating. The camp manager was kind and open to conversation and our needs. A wonderful experience!!! Thank you!!
6770,106,"we didn’t expect the view to be as spectacular as it is, nor the dome to be as luxurious. will be looking to return"
6771,106,Phenomenal location - highly recommend. Will definitely be returning!
6772,106,The place was perfect for a relaxation get away! The views were amazing!
6773,106,The views were amazing and the dome was an incredible place to soak the fall colors in.
6774,106,This location was amazing and only 30 min from Asheville. Definitely will be visiting again.
6775,106,"The views were amazing, the dome was great. Word of advice spend the money and get the hot tub!! Meeting people around the fire at night was great!"
6776,106,"Truly unique and beautiful experience. Well kept grounds and good signage. Classy and comfortable accommodations. There were some bugs in the dome and lots of critters around so although it is glamping, you're not totally removed from nature (and in my opinion that's a good thing). Would love to come back and explore more of the area."
6777,106,"Beautiful stay, looked just like the pictures!"
6778,106,Was absolutely fantastic would definitely recommend this experience and stay high
6779,106,"Definitely worth the trip - this was such a fun experience. The dome was well-equipped with everything we needed (nicely stocked kitchen and bathroom!) and certainly spacious enough for two. Incredibly comfy bed, and the view was breathtaking. We made s'mores one night at the communal fire pit (which also has plenty of grills available) and chatted with other guests who were all thrilled with their stay as well. The environment overall was so relaxed.

I will say the gravel road up and back is no joke, so plan accordingly with a car that can handle a steep grade and rough gravel terrain. The advance warnings were mostly about snow/ice, but I'd recommend an SUV no matter the season. I also wish they had been somewhat more explicit about how difficult parking an additional vehicle would be - that note is kind of buried in the pre-trip info and they make a general reference to ""overflow parking"" but you should note that overflow parking is extremely limited (really just 2-3 spots for the entire place - and it's not marked/noted anywhere, so we had to contact the host to find out where it even was). If you can swing it, I'd stick to just the one vehicle you're allotted a numbered spot for."
6780,106,Gorgeous view! We enjoyed our stay.
6781,106,This was one the most amazing places we've ever stayed. Our dome (16) was as beautiful as the pictures and the property was stunning! We can't wait to stay again. The bed was extremely comfortable and the tankless water heater was awesome!
6782,106,"Absolutely breathtaking! Coming from Florida we don’t have mountains, so to arrive to this gorgeous view was beyond words. We had a perfect view up high of the valley and mountains. The fog hovering over the valley and around the site was beautiful to watch on the first day. The dome was amazing to see in person after seeing it online. Large space to roam around, great kitchen setup, comfortable bed. Sleeping with the curtains open just to be able to see the stars was exciting. Seeing the sunrise from your bed just puts you in a good mood. The trails nearby were fun to explore.
On another note, Be aware there are small beetles (I believe) that are known to come to your dome window. They’re extremely harmless. Did not mind it after awhile but it is glamping for a reason!
As for the host, responded quickly and efficiently when needed. This experience is made to have you feel like you never need to leave!"
6783,106,Good view
6784,106,This Dome is at an amazing location with an amazing view. Lots of cool stuff to do around the area.
6785,106,Beautiful views. Nice finishes. Easy check-in/check-out. Communal fire pit and grills were nice touch. Would stay again.
6786,106,"This is absolutely the most beautiful location on earth, and the glamping is out of this world! The hosts demonstrated outstanding customer service and ensured all of the touches of a modern and luxurious camp ground…highly recommended and we will be back soon!"
6787,106,Beautiful space - absolutely stunning views!
6788,106,"This place exceeded our expectations. The dome is thoughtfully designed/decorated and clean. All of the necessary amenities were included. The location is absolutely gorgeous. I recommend leaving the curtains open at night, so you can wake up to the sunrise - It's amazing!"
6789,106,This was was one of the most beautiful Airbnbs I have stayed in. The views were amazing and you can see so many stars. It was a perfect little getaway for my partner and I!
6790,106,Everyone deserves a glamping dome vacay with the most breathtaking views!
6791,106,"Amazing place. All the details were right, and a magical location. If you want a mountain get away, I couldn’t recommend it more. Just an excellent property and experience. The view of the sunset from the summit trail is a must see, also!"
6792,106,"Great host, beautiful view."
6793,106,"Our stay here was fantastic. Beautiful views, great communication with the host, all the amenities needed, and more. We spent our days in Asheville during our stay and came back to the site to our own special getaway with stunning views. It’s well worth every penny."
6794,106,100% recommend staying here. The most amazing little retreat in the mountains with everything you need and nothing you don’t!
6795,108,"Great spot, beautiful water."
6796,108,"What a gem! Mark’s cabin was perfectly tucked into the woods and couldn’t be closer to the beautiful flowing creek. The movie library was great! Murphy is a 20-25 minute drive and had some really cute shops. We had a nice meal at Legends Steakhouse too. Mark was always responsive and helped make our stay very enjoyable. Thank you, Mark! We will be back!"
6797,108,"Fantastic stay. If you're looking to get away from the craziness of everyday life, then Mark's spot is the perfect place to unwind. The stream rushing by is the perfect background noise. So cozy and comfortable."
6798,108,"My husband and I enjoyed our very peaceful stay at this cabin. Private, clean, and the owner was easy to communicate with. Overall a wonderful stay!"
6799,108,we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Ferns Hollow. it was quiet and beautiful and Mark was very responsive.
6800,108,"Very nice cabin in beautiful, restful setting near a brook....would definitely return......"
6801,108,"The cabin snuggled down in a valley is right next to a active stream/creek that was absolutely gorgeous to watch and listen too.
In addition we arrived just in time before about 4-6” of snow.

Typical mountain cabin with a newer design shower, lots of outdoor light at night."
6802,108,Little weekend get away for me and my wife best place we have stayed
6803,108,It is a quiet quaint cabin in the woods. Enjoyed mostly indoors because of the rain the weekend we where there. It was exactly what we needed and asked for. Will return after researching the open Tellico OHV roads. This is an absolute gorgeous part of the state!
6804,108,It was exactly what our family needed. The cabin was just as it was described. The river right next to the front porch made this place so peaceful. We definitely will be returning to this cabin.
6805,108,The cabin was beautiful and exactly what we wanted for our stay. The location was perfectly secluded but easy to find. The proximity to the creek was maybe our favorite part. Mark put up a few nice Christmas decorations to add to the aesthetic. The propane fireplace made the space cozy and was much easier than a wood burning fireplace. The kitchen was well equipped. Nearby Murphy had plenty of useful amenities. We LOVED our stay there and would really enjoy a chance to go in the summer. Thanks Mark!
6806,108,"Fern Hollow is a very clean, tidy and well built cabin in a magical setting right on a babbling creek. We stayed 2 nights at the end of October 2022 and the foliage was bursting with colors. Do yourself a favor and take a left out of the driveway and drive appx 9 miles to the TN border and the ‘State Line Campground’ (vault toilets there). The hard-packed gravel road was easy to navigate in our sedan without AWD and lots of places to turn around for a normal sized car/truck despite the daunting sign as you leave pavement at the start of your adventure. The views were incredible - some of the best fall foliage I’ve ever seen. With so many rhododendrons in the forest
I think the spring bloom time would be excellent too. There is a waterfall on your left about 1.5 miles into the drive.

At the cabin, the creek was so nice to listen to. Buy firewood for the fire pit in Murphy since the wood around the cabin may be wet. We wish we could have stayed longer to linger. So much to do in the area, and just chilling on the porch rocking chairs would be sweet if we had enough time.

The Hanging Dog Mercantile you pass on the road to the cabin had live music on a Wednesday night, which was such a happy discovery. Not sure they do that on the regular. They don’t sell beer but are happy for you to bring your own to enjoy as you listen to the band. Our trip couldn’t have been better.

Mark’s check in and check out instructions were very detailed and the cabin was stocked better than expected. We would definitely stay here again."
6807,108,"Fern Hollow is a beautiful cabin set in a peaceful location. Mark, the owner, goes out of the way to make your stay as enjoyable as possible."
6808,108,"Mark's cabin was absolutely amazing! The property is beautiful and the cabin is very clean, spacious, and well stocked. Outside, we enjoyed sitting on the porch listening to the water, fishing, playing football, having campfires, & eating smores (thanks to Mark). Inside we had plenty of room to cook, eat dinner as a family, and play board games while enjoying the fireplace. The location was also perfect. We went to Amicalola Falls State Park; Leatherwood Falls; Deep Creek & The Road to Nowhere (both in Smoky Mountain Nat'l Park) while visiting. Mark was great with communicating every step of the way! I would highly recommend staying at this cabin!"
6809,108,This is an awesome place to stay and just reset into nature. The creek is so calming and the cabin is everything you could want and more. Mark has made this cabin super welcoming with all the little touches. The beds were super comfy and the shower had the best water pressure and hot water! The town is about 20 minutes away and it's so cute and friendly.
6810,108,"We loved everything about this cabin! It was the perfect weekend getaway spot for our family and dog. We enjoyed the fall weather, creek, and fire pit. Mark is an excellent host and communicator, and he ensured everything was OK when we checked in. We will be back."
6811,108,"Anyone looking for a restful retreat will love FernHollow. The cabin is neat, clean and has all you need. Just bring your food and toothbrush. You can even bring your well behaved family pet! Mark your host will walk you through the tv, Wi-Fi, and cabin key lock box. We loved staying at FernHollow and look forward to our next visit."
6812,108,Amazing place for weekend getaway.
6813,108,"Thank you for such a beautiful and peaceful stay. I would recommend to anyone needing some peace and quiet. The cabin, stream and surroundings were amazing. Thank you again."
6814,108,"Great experience! The house is such a cool log cabin and well stocked with everything we needed. Mark supplied lots of kitchen tools so we were able to cook in/ grill/ campfire meals every night of our week long stay. The house is so close to the river and the gushing water sounds amazing. The yard has awesome moss and ferns (so pretty) and our dogs loved running around with all the space. I’d recommend visiting the alpaca farm (Two Crows Alpaca Farm) 9 min away- super fun activity and nice couple runs the place. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to get away and unplug for awhile.

One thing to note was that this would not be a work-from-airbnb because there is no cell service and the wifi was coming on and off. texts/emails would not go through oftentimes. But if you want a true vacation without electronics distracting you (as we did!) then this is the perfect place to getaway and relax in the country!"
6815,108,"We enjoyed our stay here, it is definitely secluded and very peaceful! The cabin was clean and smelled great, they had everything needed to cook which we took advantage of since you aren’t close to town. We did go into town before the cabin and Murphy was cute and had some nice shops. They also had left s’mores ingredients on the table which was very thoughtful. Marks communication was great and he clearly cares that all goes well. When we got there there was a storm and the internet and satellite was out, because there was no cell reception I couldn’t call or text to say there was a problem. But Mark was already checking and knew there was an issue so it was resolved very quickly without effort on our part. Definitely recommend!"
6816,108,"Wonderful location and secluded
Nice creek we were very comfortable and will definitely come back."
6817,108,"Wow. This place is exactly what you dream of when trying to find a cabin in the woods. The porch overlooking the creek is so peaceful and the property is very well thought out. The cabin is fully stocked with necessaries as well as thoughtful touches! Mark is a great communicator and the instructions for the place are very clear and easy. I highly recommend this for anyone looking - and yes, it is very family friendly!"
6818,108,Wish we could have stayed longer
6819,108,"Awesome stay!!! Very welcoming and cozy cabin. The river right by it just tops it off. Loved all of the little extras like silk pillow cases, lush towels and wash cloths, beautiful shower and awesome gas stove. Will definitely be back here again."
6820,108,"The pictures don’t do it justice! It was paradise! It is definitely remote, so I recommend planning accordingly for food and supplies. The Hanging Dog general store has some surprisingly good options though. Also, if you turn left out of the driveway and drive a mile or so, you will see a beautiful waterfall."
6821,108,"Mark's place is fantastic! The location can't be beat. It's very beautiful, private, and serene. The cabin is very clean, comfortable, and cozy. You'll have everything you'll need at your fingertips. It's the ultimate retreat! The beds, linens, and towels are top notch. I highly recommend Mark's place! My family and I loved staying here! Mark is great with communication, too so if you do happen to need anything, he's able to help right away. Thank you, Mark! We hope to visit again soon!"
6822,108,"This was our third stay at the cabin and it never disappoints! Caught 4 trout, my family had a great time including our German Shepherd. The place is as advertised, it is quiet, really nice to step off your back porch and be able to fish. You will have a great time!"
6823,108,"This cabin and location is absolutely beautiful. We had so much fun playing in the creek, finding crayfish and salamanders and catching trout. The kitchen is well stocked. It was exactly the type of retreat we needed. Mark was very thorough with directions and easy to reach if we needed to communicate at any point. Wish we could have stayed longer than a week, hopefully we can make it back one day!"
6824,108,perfect little cabin in the mountains! the stream was beautiful everything was amazing! Mark was the best host!
6825,108,Do yourself a favor and book it. This is the place to disconnect and unwind. Very peaceful. We will be back!
6826,108,Easy paved roads. Nice and secluded so you can enjoy peace and quiet. The stream was so peaceful. Very easy communication with the owner. A great place to stay!
6827,108,"Good place to unwind and unplug. Perfect spot for fishing. I was a little put off by the cameras everywhere, took the charm out of being unplugged and away from everything. Cabin has a definate man vibe to it, good choice for guys fishing trip."
6828,108,"We loved our stay at Fern Hollow. The beds were so comfortable, the place was so clean, and the surroundings were amazing."
6829,108,Perfect place for peace and quiet away from reality
6830,108,"This is our second trip to Mark's cabin and this trip was just as good as the first! Beautiful cabin, beautiful private area, absolutely can not say enough good things. Our family of 5 and our very large dog were very comfortable and had a great time. We will most definitely be back again VERY soon!!"
6831,108,Great spot!
6832,108,Such a peaceful and beautiful place to stay to get away.
6833,108,"If you want peace and the ability to walk around in nature just out the front door, this spot is it. New kitchen items and newly remodeled shower. Propane fireplace and furniture in living room are comfy. Bunk beds were perfect for the kids. Front porch next to bubbling Brook was amazing. Firepit was great for hang time. Great host and fun small town of Murphy nearby."
6834,108,My husband and I (as well as our dogs) stayed at this cute little cabin. Lots of privacy and amazing spot right on the stream. Perfect place to relax and unwind. Mark was easy to communicate with and quick to respond.
6835,108,Great place!
6836,108,A great stay!
6837,108,"We loved our stay here and hope this becomes a regular getaway for us. I was a little concerned at first because there seemed to be a lot of rules, security and “red tape.” But once I got here I understood that this place is worth it. The cameras are there still, but they didn’t bother us. Rules are easy to follow and helpful. It has pretty much everything you’ll need. You’ll need to bring your own firewood for the fire pit."
6838,108,Had a lovely stay as always. Woke up or last morning to a few inches of snow. We were really sad to leave the winter wonder land. I'll definitely book again. So peaceful and relaxing.
6839,108,"Absolutely amazing place full of everything you need and want. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! Mark was an excellent host, communicating clearly throughout the trip. We had a fabulous time indoors and out! :)"
6840,108,"This is a super cozy, very clean, authentic cabin in a magical location. No cell service but the wifi was great for calls and e-mails. We tried like hell to stay outside all weekend, but the DVD collection made that impossible -- some of the best movies ever made are in this cabin! Everything is clearly marked (labels!), hooks galore (convenient!), great lighting, REAL candles (not common), clean and well-stocked kitchen, amazing fire pit right by the creek. Owner is a great communicator and can help with anything. Security cameras are fully disclosed, but beware -- there's no place outside or on the porch where a camera isn't watching. One is pointed at the cabin, and another tracks you while you walk! Feels excessive, but when you see this place, you'll get it. There's a lot more to protect here than privacy.

Pack a lunch and turn left out of the driveway. This cabin is right at the edge of heaven!"
6841,108,We had a wonderful experience and it was nice to unplug for a bit and enjoy ourselves and the surrounding locations.
6842,108,"This location was great, and the cabin was even better. I would recommend this stay, and look forward to returning. My favorite part was the outdoor fire pit by the river."
6843,108,"Great location right on the river, perfect for a quiet weekend away and very dog friendly!"
6844,108,Mark’s cabin is absolute heaven! We took our family there to celebrate our 10 year anniversary and were so pleased as soon as we arrived. The cabin is cozy and has everything we needed for a comfortable stay. The river and woods were so peaceful and soothing. We spent hours outside just taking it all in. The fireplace along with the cabins’ style and decor really made us feel as if we were in “the little cabin in the big woods.” We we’re sad to leave and plan to make another visit in the future.
6845,108,"Lovely setting, very relaxing. Enjoyed the trout stream and outdoor fire pit! Could use some updating……(furnishings, etc.)……but overall pretty good. We could see ourselves returning for another visit."
6846,108,Amazing property! It is worth it for the sound of the stream alone!
6847,108,"What a perfect place. Private, quiet, beautiful, cozy and settled off the road in the middle of Western Carolina's most gorgeous forests. Drives to hikes and waterfalls and ancient forests are under two hours or less. You can enjoy the lovely stream from the outdoor fire or from the porch. Mark makes everything easy and is very responsive to any questions you may have. This place is so special. We will be back!"
6848,108,Fern Hollow is a cozy cabin tucked away in the woods. The creek that runs behind the cabin is incredible! Mark does a wonderful job at making sure you have everything you need and answering all questions from the beginning until the end. It’s a wonderful place to get away!!!
6849,108,Scenic and beautiful. We enjoyed our stay very much.
6850,108,"This might be our favorite Airbnb stay ever! Mark has created a perfect escape at Fernhollow and we can't wait to return. The cabin is perfection, the creek is perfection, the proximity to both the town of Murphy and the National Forest...all perfection! Mark is also an incredibly thorough and helpful host. We would give it 6 stars if we could!"
6851,108,"Spent ten nights and had a great stay, despite a ton of rain. The creek is fantastic. To be able to fall asleep to that sound is truly amazing. Loved the porch. Rocking chairs with that view and soundtrack is so sweet. As other guests have mentioned, the cabin is clean and well-stocked. Shower water is nice and hot, though I might suggest replacing the curtain liner as well as raising the shower rod about 4"" so it doesn't get underfoot. Mark is easy to reach and very responsive.

One point I'd like to share with potential guests, as I did with Mark, is a camera on the outer facade of the porch...it points out to the creek. I noticed that as I moved, it followed me. Walked back, it followed me. When no objects are in view/moving, it returns to a centered position. Mark indicated he was unaware that it tracked this way, and that is a camera for security and for potential flood monitoring. He also stated he does not view activity notifications from cameras while guests are staying. Despite this, I can tell you it was very concerning to me when I first observed it.

It's a very special property. I do understand the need for owner security, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that level now that I've experienced it."
6852,108,We had a great stay at this cabin. It was clean and adorable. The internet worked great and it even had a home phone just in case you needed. The greatest part about this cozy cabin was the soothing sounds of the streaming water nearby. You could hear the water from the front porch rocking chairs which was my favorite part. Overall experience was perfect!
6853,108,"We had a nice relaxing time! GPS directions are spot on and checking in was very easy. We hiked a trail that was close called Grape smugglers Trail that was nice and easy. The brewery in town was a lot of fun, and pizza was great! Other then that we drove to Cherokee the rest of the time to hike there. Had a great stay, would recommend it."
6854,108,"Mark is great! We enjoyed staying at the cabin and unplugging, working on fly fishing skills (I caught 5 trout while we were there for 2.5 days), it was very relaxing. I recommend it!"
6855,108,Great Place! The entire place is well kept and clean. The stream and the property is amazing. Very quite and you feel like you have the area to yourself. The kitchen is very well stocked which is a huge plus when you never plan to leave (one of the best kitchens i have seen using air bnb). Highly recommend to anyone! It is a bit of a drive to get back to a store so it is best to get what you need on the way in. We never left once we arrived. Mark is great host and easy to communicate with. We hope to go back!
6856,108,"What an absolute find! I hesitate to write a glowing review as we want to keep this place our little secret! Perfect size for a comfy getaway complete with a cosy living room, huge windows, rocking chairs on the porch, extensive DVD collection (it was extra fun trying to choose!), and a stream that is literally right there outside your window. Nothing like cool air and white noise to relax every part of your body and mind. Our dog loved playing in the creek and snoozing on the porch. In all honesty, the photos don't do this rental justice; it will be even better than you think it is. Mark was an incredibly helpful and thoughtful host with lots of personal touches throughout the home. Additionally, the entire cabin was extremely clean, not an easy feat I'm sure for an outdoorsy, pet-friendly cabin. We are already trying to figure out how/when we can come back. Our only regret is we didn't book enough nights."
6857,108,"This is a hidden gem, a very nice and neat cabin, a good place to enjoy the mountains ⛰👍🏼💚"
6858,108,Mark is a great host!!
6859,108,Extremely nice! Had a great time. Would definitely stay there again.
6860,108,"This cabin is great! There were three adults in our party, and we all agreed that we could not
have found a better place. When you first leave your car, you hear the wonderful sound of the creek, which flows right in front of the cabin. There are several rocking chairs on the covered front porch so that you can sit and enjoy the sound effects! The cabin itself is well appointed with just about everything that we needed for our four-night stay. Mark provides good information before check-in, and he was readily available for the several questions that we texted him. Be sure that your phones are programmed for calling over wifi, because you will not get cell service. Murphy itself is a small community, and we had good food at the Red Brick Deli and at the Brewery. Don’t bother with the Chophouse, but do hit up The Sweet Tooth for some Mayfield’s ice cream!"
6861,108,This was exactly what we needed as a family. The cabin was stocked better than anyplace else we have stayed. Mark was great communicating with us. Unfortunately we did not catch any trout but my son and our dog had a blast playing in the creek. Overall it was a great vacation.
6862,108,"Mark’s cabin is a clean, comfortable place to stay about 15 minutes from town. The location right on a beautiful, fast-flowing stream is just incredible. You hear the rush of water as soon as you step out of your car. We spent much of our vacation fishing — and by fishing I mean standing by the water with fishing lines in a completely empty stream. The water is crystal clear and we saw no life the whole time we were there. But that was ok by us. Just standing out there was relaxing and restorative. My only issues with the cabin was that while the listing mentioned WiFi in the name and description of the cabin, I got a message the evening before check-in that we could not stream anything on his internet. That’s an important note that would have been nice to know when booking — not the day before arrival. I talked with him about it and he said he changed the listing to reflect that streaming is not allowed. Obviously, that’s not a dealbreaker in many cases, but if you plan to handle any work video calls while there or stream TV, music, movies, this isn’t the place for you. In that very lengthy note Mark also said he would only provide one roll of toilet paper and limited other items. That would have also been helpful to know beforehand as we are still trying to avoid going into stores now and had to stop along the way with a baby and two dogs. Not ideal. Overall, I would not book again because I feel the WiFi info was a bit of a bait and switch, but the location on the water is truly spectacular if you’re looking for a place to relax."
6863,108,Fern Hallow was absolutely perfect. Couldn't ask for more gorgeously secluded creek spot. Me and my dog hope to make this a regular getaway spot for us. Mark was an excellent host with great communication. You could really tell how much he cares for this beautiful cabin. Kitchen and cabin were well stocked with essentials.
6864,108,"Mark is an excellent host! The cabin was just as described! Clean, well maintained and fully stocked! We enjoyed our downtime watching movies and hanging out by the creek."
6865,108,One of the best furnished/decorated cabins I've ever stayed in. Great location and very clean.
6866,108,"Loved our stay at Mark’s cabin by the creek. Everything is as pictured and as described. Cabin was exceptionally clean with no visible bugs or cobwebs you might expect staying in a cabin. We enjoyed the charcoal grill, making a fire and roasting s’mores Mark left for us. The creek is great for wading and our dog loved it! Murphy is close by with a River walk and busy town square. Check out the new family operated Mimo’s for homemade ice cream! Would love to rebook this place in the fall!"
6867,108,Very beautiful and peaceful! if your looking for a quiet trip to just relax this is the place for you!
6868,108,This place is definitely a trip to remember. The cabin and stream were even better than they looked in the pictures.
6869,108,Great place for unwinding. The trout stream was a nice touch for this old fly fisherman! Quiet and nicely appointed. We will likely be back. Owner was great and made sure the cabin was clean and stocked with essentials.
6870,108,"We would definitely recommend this cabin and host. The place was spotless and very nicely furnished, and communication with Mark was always easy and helpful. Kitchen was well-equipped and the furniture and beds were comfortable."
6871,108,"Fern Hollow was nothing short of amazing!!! We traveled with small children and I was nervous, but there were even baby gates, board games & a sippy cup. The entire family thoroughly enjoyed this vacation and we would definitely stay there again!"
6872,108,"Great getaway! Cabin was very clean and felt very warm and homey. Perfect setting on a beautiful lot with a creek that has trout. Has all you need, private and so beautiful!!"
6873,108,"The cabin location is idyllic—-a true “gem”. Set well back from the road, through the woods, all with ease of access. We thoroughly enjoyed the sight and sound of the rushing stream throughout our stay—-so much so, we did not use air-conditioning so we could leave the windows open to enjoy the sound when in cabin. (Due to location- air would only be needed in late afternoon if the humidity climbs). With the exception of a brief trip to the quaint town of Murphy, we spent all our time at the cabin—either on the porch—-in our hammocks strung up right by the stream, or at the fire pit. We loved the setting of this cabin and did not want to leave—the stream and surrounding forest, the seclusion and privacy, were the best we have experienced of the many cabins we have stayed at in the mountains. The cabin was also very well stocked and the kitchen had everything we needed to cook all our meals—-we loved the gas stove. Cabin furnishings were comfortable, good lighting, ceiling fans and cozy decor. Great views from the very large, well placed screened and plentiful windows—brought the outdoors in. The choice of gas and/or charcoal grilling is a great amenity you don’t normally have (charcoal is ours), and was appreciated. We brought just one-of our pups, (even though Mark let us know we could bring both) and due to the clear and easy access to the stream —our senior doodle Annie was able to enjoy the area. Mark was an attentive host—wanting to make sure we enjoyed our stay and response was always quick. We would love to return someday! FYI: if you enjoy a scenic drive, turn left when leaving the driveway & head up the mountain, the road meanders along the stream, with small waterfalls, eventually turning into a well maintained narrow gravel road, if you take it over the mountain, (which we did) it becomes paved again and takes you into the Cherokee National Park, and the paved road is all along streams (eventually river) with incredible views and waterfalls. There are public restrooms along the way. It was a wonderful drive, that we took as we were headed home. The 3 hours it added to our travel home was well worth it!"
6874,108,Mark gives great details/directions about his home and Murphy. He responded quickly to some questions we had. The place is very cute and the stream nearby is very peaceful. Definitely recommend if you’re staying in Murphy!
6875,108,"This cabin exceeded my expectations. It was so comfortable and cozy! We loved the fireplace inside and all the cooking and kitchen supplies provided. The beds are comfortable and it was SPARKLING CLEAN!
We really appreciated how Mark left supplies for s’mores’ too! Our favorite part was the outdoor area with plenty of chairs, fire pit, and the creek. My 4 year old son spent the entire weekend fishing and playing in the water. It was exactly what we were hoping for and more!"
6876,108,The cabin was immaculate and the proximity to the creek was one of the best features. Mark was a great host with stellar communication and would always answer questions in a span of minutes.
6877,108,"This house is great! The spot on the creek is wonderful, I caught 2 brook trout there and it is a great spot to fly fish. Mark was a very kind host, thoughtful with many details, suggestions about what to do and the area. The internet is not made for streaming, but allowed access to phone calls, check email, web surfing, etc. It is very secluded and comfortable, a great spot to unplug and unwind. We will look forward to staying there again soon."
6878,108,This was a great secluded cabin. Mark was great about staying in contact in case we needed anything. The stream and outdoor space were beautiful and just what we needed for some relaxation. We didn’t want to leave.
6879,110,"Awesome location and a very cute place. Super responsive and helpful check in process. Great spot for two people, we would stay again!"
6880,110,I haven't had much experience with Airbnb but this was an awesome weekend. It was easy to find and for the price it was hard to beat this location. The fact that i had a great restaurant to my back and was 20 second walk to the beach was really nice.
6881,110,"My dog and I LOVED our stay here! When we arrived, the place was super clean and cute! I loved how close the dog area was and how we were right on the beach! The restaurant being so close was also super convenient. The host was super responsive and nice enough to bring me towels during my stay! I would definitely stay here again!!"
6882,110,"Hi Megan, in your private review you mentioned the WiFi being weak at times and that was the reason for 4 stars. We can only remedy what we control and WiFi all over the island is sometimes spotty. We have the highest available service and boost it as well. I certainly hope you will reconsider based on this being beyond our control. Thanks!"
6883,110,This was my second time coming here and I would go back again! The location is ideal- just a few steps away from the ocean and very close to lots of good restaurants. Everything was super clean and tidy; I had everything I needed. My dog and I had a wonderful weekend stay even with one day of rain. Looking forward to our next trip!
6884,110,We enjoyed a quick weekend away and being able to walk to the beach and bring our dogs was great!
6885,110,"First time using an Air B&B. This was so easy. All the things you worry about like bad actors and place not up to your standards were nothing to worry about. I must say this place was very nice. We slept like a baby and enjoyed the beach. Everything was easy. We could get into the place with an easy access code. Jeffery's team made us feel comfortable. The instructions were visible and easy to find within the Bungalow. When we walked into the Bungalow, our expression was WOW everything is crisp and in place and very appealing."
6886,110,"Wonderful stay in Surf City! Right on the beach, conveniently located near restaurants and stores. And our pup had just as much fun as we did!"
6887,110,Loved that it was next to a restaurant with live music. Had a great time and will be back again in the future!
6888,110,Perfect location. Beautiful place. Definitely stay here again.
6889,110,absolutely amazing place to stay! highly recommended!
6890,110,What a wonderful stay we had! Really close to the beach and it was nice having a restaurant right there too! The space itself is super updated and comfortable. We look forward to returning!
6891,110,"Small, but very nice place. The location to the beach is very convenient, music was not an issue and was done by 9:00pm both nights. Would stay again. Perfect beach stay for a couple wanting to get away."
6892,110,We enjoyed our stay at the Bungalow!! The place was clean and check in was easy! It just what we needed for a week at the beach. The beach was so close. It was a great location on the Island!!
6893,110,Great location. Great place with a dog. No freezer. Music next door was great!
6894,110,We had a great stay! Very cute studio! Great music from the bar behind.
6895,110,"Very nice, clean and right on the beach. Easy check in and perfect for us. Great AC too."
6896,110,Great place to stay and was very clean. We really enjoyed the location and would definitely stay again. Great suggestions of where to go.
6897,110,My wife and I had an amazing time while celebrating our wedding anniversary.
6898,110,"This is a good value and location for beach access. If you are a dog parent it’s perfect! No searching for a grassy patch for Fido, it’s right outside your door. Enjoy the bikes and walk steps to a restaurant!"
6899,110,"Hi Amy, definitely loved your suggestions. We've already been replacing the beach chairs as they seem to rust almost weekly! Thanks again and hope to see you back!"
6900,110,"You really can’t beat this location! It’s an easy walk to the beach and an easy walk to some bars and restaurants. The restaurant behind the house does have live music most nights so it could be a little loud inside, but it ended at a reasonable time each night. Well worth it to be so close to the beach."
6901,110,"My boyfriend, our pup and I stayed in the Turtle Bungalow for a long weekend Fri-Mon. The location is 10/10--right next to a public beach access on a quaint dead end. The parking was tight but plenty of spots available usually. Great grassy area right beside the house with plenty of trashcans for dog waste. The outdoor shower came in handy when coming in from the beach, but there was a broom and dustpan inside to get any sand tracked in. The unit was small but just enough room for us two and our pup for 3 nights. The kitchen and bathroom were stocked with the essentials and the shower was huge. Our particular unit faced the Surf City Line restaurant/bar next door, but it wasn't a problem at all. The music was nice to listen to from our patio and ended by 10pm. The restaurant was amazing. Definitely reccomend the shrimp tacos YUM! and 20 steps away. Overall, we had a great time and would come back next year."
6902,110,Nice place to stay
6903,110,Great location a few steps from the beach and right next to Surf City Line restaurant. Enjoyed the live music on the back porch and the nights on the beach!
6904,110,"beautiful place,beautiful beach,would definitely recommend."
6905,110,Great location. Loved listening to the live music and grilling.
6906,110,"This place was perfect for our beach stay in Surf City! The location was top notch being only steps from public beach access. It made our entire stay worth every penny! The unit specifically was just as shown and advertised. It was small, but perfect enough for a couple with a pup. The unit above us were early risers which kinda stunk as we could hear all movement, but the ear plugs left for us were a nice touch. It also just forced us to start our daily beach walks a bit earlier which wasn’t necessarily a bad thing! The fenced in yard right behind our unit was super convenient and our pup really enjoyed having a space to roam. He also met two other dogs during our stay which was so fun. Only suggestion would be to maybe replace the current tv stand with a dresser of some sort…with the unit being so small I would have loved somewhere to put clothes (and hide socks from our sock thief pup). There was a stand for us to hang some clothes which was awesome. Tip: bring a little pop up hamper to leave in the bathroom! It was a life saver and saved so much space in the actual unit. Live music behind us at the restaurant was great and we loved listening on our patio after coming back from dinner. Overall a wonderful stay and would recommend to anyone! Thanks for hosting us for our first Surf City trip, we already can’t wait to come back!"
6907,110,Perfect place and location for a long weekend at the beach. photos and description are accurate. The restaurant right behind the bungalow isn't a problem. It closes at 11 and isn't too loud.
6908,110,Skip this one
6909,110,"Great location, not far from beach access! Loved the music at night from our patio. The fenced in area for dogs was perfect. Would love to stay again some time!"
6910,110,My husband and I had a great time! The parking lot did flood because of the rain but we were close to the beach and right beside a restaurant/bar with live music and overall had a great time 😊
6911,110,Great location! Our pup enjoyed the fenced in yard and so did we! The bar behind the unit was a lot of fun we loved the music! Would definitely recommend for 1-2 people!
6912,110,Perfect spot for a getaway with our crazy pup on her first beach experience! We will definitely stay again! It was even better than expected and we walked over to the nearby resturant twice for food and drinks. 2 minute walk to beach access and the fenced area for our dog was great!
6913,110,Great location! Would book again! 10/10 :)
6914,110,"This place may be small, but it’s the perfect place for a small family or single traveler to get in their beach time. On site parking was great, the apartment is, no joke, a 2 minute walk away, and it was cleanly and comfy to stay in. My dog had a great time and like that he had a yard to do his business in just off the patio. I brought his 30ft lead and tied it to a post when I was out back so he could roam. The beach is very dog friendly as well as some of the local eateries."
6915,110,"Hi Jenn and thank you for the kind review! FYI, this week we're adding the fence so well behaved doggies have more freedom! We added that to our other location (Hideaway) and the guests love it!"
6916,110,"Location and view can’t be beat! This stay had everything I needed for a quick, affordable beach get-away. Loved that I had a bike at my disposal! Loved the restaurant a few feet from the bungalow—it was hard not to eat there every day! Check in was the easiest! The room was immaculate. Will be back!"
6917,110,"Perfect size for one or two individuals. Easy walk to the beach. Nice to have beach chairs provide. Wonderful shower. In the high season, the close by restaurant could get loud but the music was quite enjoyable during our stay; the food is good as well. For a getaway for one or two people, this is perfect."
6918,110,"My husband, pup and I had an amazing stay at Jeffrey’s studio in Surf City. It’s steps away from the beach and has a restaurant connected to it in the back with great drinks and food. The beach was very private and dog friendly as well. Great beach get away!"
6919,110,We had a great time staying at the Turtle Shell Bungalows!! We would like to thank Tiffany for her prompt response on taking care of our needs. We'll definitely book another stay in the near future.
6920,110,"This was a great dog friendly find located right on the beach, only separated by a dune. It is also located at the end of a private drive, so the only traffic were the renters who were staying there. We found sweet personal touches upon our arrival that included a basket with water, a doggie biscuit and ear plugs (we stayed in Unit G which is next to the restaurant, but did not find it to be too loud.)"
6921,110,Very clean and conveniently located.
6922,110,Perfect Location and getaway spot! Enjoyed waking up and having the beach just a few feet away! Also so nice that I was able to bring my dog with me and there was even a treat waiting for him :) There were also tons of restaurants and cafes close by that were so good and a live band played at thw restaurant directly behind the apartment which was awesome! Highly recommend booking if you are looking for a spot on the beach for an affordable price! Would definitely come back!
6923,110,"We had a great stay here with our pups. We needed to escape to the beach after holiday so our dogs could have a little fun. We loved waking up and walking to the beach. Awesome location, steps away from the access.
After our long morning and afternoon walks, we enjoyed relaxing on the porch with lunch and dinner. Great restaurant right across our unit. We had all the necessities needed for a quick trip.
We are keeping this place in our back pocket for the next visit"
6924,110,"2nd stay at this cute bungalow - and just as great as the first time. It is an extremely clean, large studio space with a king size bed, large shower, & smart TV/internet, coffee pot, fridge, etc. Units F & G, & B face the totally cool Surf City Line Pub & Restaurant & the unit opens to a nice grassy area our 2 pooches loved. The beach is on the other side where you have your own parking space. The place is exactly as advertised & commo with the owners was super easy. If you & your pups want a great value, super location & upgraded space, this is it."
6925,110,This property was perfect for us and our pups. The location and amenities made our stay. The hosts even provided dog treats for the pups and they were very excited about that. The property itself was cute and practical for us and our needs. Having The Line restaurant right behind the property was great for dinner options. Will absolutely stay again when we are back in town!
6926,110,"Amazing place to stay! Brought my dogs, we had a great time! Great location, very quite and pleasant place! Will definitely come back again!"
6927,110,My husband and I (along with our pup) really enjoyed our stay. It’s perfect for a weekend getaway for two. The room was well equipped and everything was VERY clean. No “wet dog” small you may encounter at some other pet friendly stays. Within steps to the beach which was awesome. We stayed at the back of the unit closer to the restaurant behind the bungalows and like the description says it can get loud due to the band in the evening but it was usually over by 10:30. If you want something quieter maybe a unit in the front is best but we enjoyed the music. If you have a pup with some anxiety related to noise/larger groups of people may not want to stay in a back unit. Overall we really enjoyed the stay. Room and location was great. Super dog friendly. Hosts were great as well! I would definitely recommend.
6928,110,Great location. As described nice and clean
6929,110,This place was extremely convenient! It is just steps from the beach. On Friday and Saturday there was a band playing at the backyard bar and we sat to listen. It was so easy to have our dog here and definitely want to come back!
6930,110,"Wonderful place, location great! Will return again
Restaurant that is right behind Airbnb is wonderful food and drinks."
6931,110,"Super place EXACTLY as advertised. VERY clean & updated. Super location to Surf City, the beach, & surrounding area. Great beach getaway for a mature couple with/without a dog. We’ll definitely choose this place again."
6932,110,Great Great location! Loved having live music at night from the restaurant behind us. Having bikes available to ride at whim was awesome. Loved how dog friendly this place was! Overall we had a great stay!
6933,110,"A lovely stay yet again! Perfect little getaway for a girl and her pups!! Hosts are very helpful and responsive to needs. This was my 2nd time at the bungalow, different unit. Loved the patio table and enjoyed listening to the music from the restaurant behind. Will be coming back again for sure. Thank you!!!"
6934,110,Jeffreys place was such a wonderful trip to the beach. The proximity to the water could not have been better! Would highly recommend this place for a spectacular beach getaway. We will be back!
6935,110,"This is an amazing place. It’s within steps of the first public access to the beach. The hosts are so great and welcoming. Lovely beach home. The restaurant next door has live music, but it’s not loud and ends by 9pm on weekdays and 11pm on weekends. Great spot for dogs too. I definitely recommend staying here!"
6936,110,"Great little spot, close to the beach!"
6937,110,Enjoyed our stay! Loved the proximity to the beach.
6938,110,"Loved your place.
Perfect for two.
Enjoyed the neighborhood Surf City Line club.
Great Music every evening. (Note: Music is quiet at very reasonable hour)
I'll definitely go back."
6939,110,AMAZING LOCATION!! The fact that we could get a place so close to the beach where we could bring our dog for such a great price is still unbelievable. Very clean. Hosts were very responsive. Perfect for a quick beach getaway!
6940,110,"We had a great time. Location was great, restaurants nearby were great. Definitely recommend staying here."
6941,110,"There is live music in the evenings, but we were provided earplugs. Parking is not always available near the bungalow. We had to park across the street in the lot available for most of our stay. Overall, we had a great experience there!"
6942,110,"Perfect little spot right on the beach. Close to Surf City and attractions, and easy to get to north Topsail for excellent bird watching. Nice size for two people."
6943,110,Fantastic place on the beach. Highly recommended.
6944,110,"Stayed here for a weekend, place was just as described, steps away from the beach. Host was very communicative, will definitely consider for future bookings."
6945,110,Communication on day of check-in was good. Place was as described.
6946,110,Absolutely amazing location and a wonderful place to relax after a long day on the beach. The live music we could hear from the restaurant next door was an added bonus. Would recommend to anyone!
6947,110,"I've been to Topsail several times and love the area. Jeffrey's place was great! Perfect for a few nights. It's right on the water, you can walk about 20 feet and you'll be on the sand. The airbnb itself was super clean, and they provide clean linens and towels that come wrapped. Bed and pillows were more comfortable than most airbnbs I've stayed at. Directions were clear, no issues with check-in or check-out, and you're only about 5 minutes from the main bridge area. A little bonus is that they provide beach chairs which were great since we forgot one of ours. Also, Jeff's restaurant right behind the airbnb was so good, I ate there three times."
6948,110,"It was our first time here and loved the area. The place was close to the beach, restaurants, and dog friendly. We will definitely be back!"
6949,110,"My husband, our dog Remy, and I enjoyed our time at the Turtle Bungalow. The location can’t be beat (right on the beach) and the host provides all the necessities for you to enjoy your days on the beach. The drinks and view at the restaurant directly behind the bungalow was very nice."
6950,110,We enjoyed our stay! This studio is a great fit for one person or a couple. Grassy area in the back was perfect for our dog! There is a restaurant directly behind the bungalow with delicious food and live music however can also get loud at night. We would be happy to stay here again
6951,110,"We enjoyed our stay at the Turtle Shell Bungalow. It was very enjoyable! We were so close to the beach. The bungalow was decorated perfectly with so many beachy touches. The white noise machine was a nice touch & was set to ocean sounds. The bed was very comfortable. Together they provided a nice oasis while sleeping.

The bungalow is well equipped for a day at the beach. The beach toys and beach chairs were a nice surprise and thoughtful.

Surf City is a beautiful beach area. We loved the easy access to the beach and enjoyed our stay very much. We would definitely return."
6952,110,"This place was great for the two of us and our dog. It's basically on the beach! There were nice personal touches for a small efficiency like Poo-pouri in the bathroom, coffee supplies, plenty of paper products and even a couple of dog treats. Be sure to bring your own beach towels and since it is a multi-unit building with dogs, you'll probably hear barking."
6953,110,"If you are traveling with a dog perfect. close to the beach fantastic area, be sure to take towels Not a lot of traffic and fun for all"
6954,110,"Great location. Pet friendly. Good value for the beach location. Renters should be aware the unit is right next to a bar with live music. Great if you love live music, not so much if you are looking for peace and quiet on the patio."
6955,110,We enjoyed our stay here! The only negative was that there is a bar with live music right next door and bands are setup right beside the backyard to the room. It was pretty loud when trying to wind down after a day at the beach. Other than that it was a nice place to stay and the location to the beach was perfect!
6956,110,"Super close to the beach and restaurant. Quiet dead end road makes the street less traveled, except those staying at the Bungalow. Great for a quick beach trip!"
6957,110,"We came to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary and it did not disappoint! We loved being able to bring our puppy.
It is a wonderful location right across from the beach! loved the sound machine at night:) We definitely would love to come back and stay again!"
6958,110,"We went for a couples getaway and couldnt be happier that we found this hidden gem. This little condo was not only cozy but had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. We had such a relaxing time sitting on our patio with a cold drink or walking only 100 steps to the beach. The communication with the host was outstanding and they responded promptly with any questions we had.

We will be back!!"
6959,110,Wonderful location and stay! Communication with Jeffrey was very easy and quick! Can’t wait to come back!
6960,110,"Everything about this bungalow from the time I walked through the door was outstanding. The direct access to the beach and walking distance to local establishments was spectacular. If you’re looking for the perfect, well appointed place to stay look no further. I will definitely be booking again."
6961,110,Very clean condo with a great location to the beach. Lots of privacy and very comfortable. We would definitely stay here again.
6962,110,"We loved our stay, steps from the ocean was just what we were looking for!"
6963,110,"This is the perfect spot for two travelers, everything you need in one spot! Convenient location, just pop over the dunes (using the stairs of course) and the beach is all yours! If you are looking for great food, you will be in luck since this spot is close to everything Surf City has to offer or you can drive further south to Topsail Beach or to North Topsail for some great options! Jeff was a great host and always responsive to messages, and super helpful anytime a question came up. I can’t wait to stay here again!"
6964,110,Such a lovely spot. I love the simplicity cleanliness and location to the beach is awesome. I will be back!
6965,110,Great location! The home was so clean and perfect for a weekend getaway! Highly recommended ... and you can bring your fur baby!!
6966,110,"This is a prime location! The whole place is so comfy and safe, you will never want to leave! The beach is a short walk up to the ramp and the area feels so private. I love this place so much and you will too!"
6967,110,"Incredible location (right on the beach). Phenomenal hosts, very clean, have zero complaints and would absolutely recommend this bungalow to anyone visiting!"
6968,110,A great place to stay! The location is hard to beat.
6969,110,Great location! We brought our dogs with us and there is a very nice grassy area where you can walk them. Very clean and comfortable place!
6970,110,"Hi Megan and thanks for the review. FYI, I'm going to put in ""baby gates"" so outside of your unit you'd be able to let the doggies relax w/o having to be with them 24/7. I am adding them on the 4 studio units (the top floor units already have gates). Thanks!"
6971,110,"Nice, quiet little complex at end of dead end road. Had to work but enjoyed the change of scenery for sure! And everyone in Topsail/Surf City is so nice!"
6972,110,A perfect spot for a weekend getaway! Steps away from the beach and a short distance to local bars and shops. The room was super comfy and well furnished with thoughtful touches throughout. We’ll definitely be back!
6973,110,great place. had everything we needed. was very pet friendly my 2 elderly dogs had a wonderful time also
6974,111,"Such a comfortable and peaceful place! We were able to relax and enjoy the outdoors with our family. Our kids loved fishing in the pond and we enjoyed watching the serene river from the porch. It was so nice to be able to make a fire on the cool mornings and to have coffee on the porch everyday! This is an absolute gem of a place, from every small detail to the whole architecture of the cabin. We hope to return again soon!"
6975,111,"Absolutely beautiful place to stay
Great hosts
Would highly recommend"
6976,111,"This place is magical!! We were able to unwind & relax, walk the beautiful property, go fishing, & get a tour of the farm while we were there.

Janice was such a great host! She responded right away, provided recommendations for things to do & provided great directions for accessing the property. The cabin is beautiful extremely comfortable. We loved being able to just sit on the porch & watch the cows grazing and also look at the river.

This was a perfect escape & exactly what we needed. Thank you!!"
6977,111,"My family and I LOVED our stay at Janice and Tom's place. I did get a chance to talk to Tom while there, and he was very friendly. The cabin was so pretty and felt like home. We will definitely be back!"
6978,111,Back to the Earth Farm was more like ‘Heaven on Earth’! I didn’t think this cabin could actually be better than the stunning pictures- it was amazing!! A great place to unwind and relax but also be within a reasonable distance to our friends in Greensboro and Raleigh. They were the most gracious hosts with wonderful communication. We will be back again!
6979,111,"Beautiful place, loved it!"
6980,111,Thank you Natalie!!!
6981,111,A fantastic cabin in a great location!
6982,111,"The cabin of our dreams, serene surroundings and kind hosts. What more could you ask for?"
6983,111,"Back To Earth Farm is a peaceful place to “get away from it all” while providing all the comforts for a life well lived.

I loved all of the subtle luxuries such as the kitchen countertops, the buck stove, the gorgeous handcrafted dining table, the hanging bed and I especially appreciated the soothing sounds from the Uwharrie River right next to the cabin.

Hope to visit again soon."
6984,111,"This was our third trip to this cabin, and there are many reasons why we keep coming back! Not only is it an amazing cabin in a beautiful, peaceful, serene setting where we are able to truly relax and de-stress, but Janice and Tom are wonderful hosts who are friendly and responsive. We definitely want to continue to visit this wonderful retreat!"
6985,111,Beautiful cabin in a beautiful location. We had a great time during our stay and would love to visit again. I would recommend to anyone looking for a peaceful place to relax.
6986,111,We had a lovely stay including a farm tour. Tom and Janice were wonderful hosts.
6987,111,Thank you! You were wonderful guests.
6988,111,"Went to the retreat with some girl friends for a chance to relax and reconnect. It was the perfect spot! We relaxed on the porch next to the creek, walked the paths around the farm and enjoyed the cozy feel of the modern but rustic cabin. The directions were very clear and if we needed help or suggestions they responded right away! We want to go back!"
6989,111,"We were left speechless with this location, the amount of peace and calamity is out of this world, they provide such good service and they are really friendly people. We enjoyed every single moment we were there."
6990,111,We had a great time! the cabin is awesome and very well equipped. The surroundings are very nice.
6991,111,Absolutely beautiful space- very gracious hosts and wonderful escape from the business to this quiet cabin. Every family member enjoyed their stay.
6992,111,"This was a very cozy, clean cabin. We had a wonderful time. Peaceful and serene. Such a relaxing vacation. Tom and Janice are amazing hosts. The sound of the River was so nice. Can’t wait to return."
6993,111,Beautiful cabin and peaceful environment. We didn’t want to leave the cabin to go anywhere!
6994,111,"Quiet, beautiful, homey cedar cabin with all the fix’ins. Best AirBnB option in the area."
6995,111,"The cabin is excellent, clean and as presented in the pictures! Janice and Tom were very communicative during our stay. Also, the scenery and the river next to the cabin made this one of the most relaxing places we have stayed. My family cannot wait to go back!"
6996,111,A nearly perfect stay at an adorable cabin! The pastoral setting is perfect for decompressing from the busy city life! They are absolutely wonderful hosts and thought of everything! I have already told my family and friends about this place! Love love love it!
6997,111,"The cabin is gorgeous and so cool! My friends and I stayed there for just two nights, unfortunately. We could have just spent all our time at the cabin or walking around the farm and it would have been a lovely trip by itself. Sweet personal touches made us feel welcome. There were only four of us, but it could easily have been a larger group, sleeping and loving comfortably. We loved sipping coffee on the porch in the rocking chairs, looking out over the creek, cooking dinner over a campfire, warming up with the wood fire stove. There were plenty of useful supplies in the kitchen, making it feel like more like we were in a well-stocked home than a sparse hotel room. The hosts were easy to stay in touch with when we had questions. We wish we had more time there!"
6998,111,"Our family of four really enjoyed our stay at Janice and Tom’s cabin. The cabin was very clean, comfortable and very well stocked. I didn’t need to use half the stuff I brought as the house provided more than we expected. Our boys enjoyed the creek and the fire pit and we all enjoyed hanging out on the wrap around porch with hammocks and rockers. It was a short but relaxing trip!"
6999,111,"In a word, restorative. Janice and Tom’s cabin on the Uwharrie River is an idyllic getaway that delivered on all the enticing images that compelled us to make the reservation. Don’t worry about forgetting to pack an essential, because your hosts have thought of every amenity. The local pastries were a treat, and the well-stocked firewood cut perfectly for fire pit or indoor buck stove. The natural cedar details in this well built and finely crafted cabin are charming and aroma-therapeutic to boot! We hope to return soon."
7000,111,"Everything was as exactly described or pictured! Our family had a great time while staying at the cabin, and we will be repeat visitors."
7001,111,"This was our fourth stay at Back to Earth Farm, and we loved every moment. Our hosts are fantastic, and the setting is spectacular. We will continue to return to this piece of heaven."
7002,111,"If you're looking for a place to stay near the zoo with kids, this is it! Our six year-old loved the cabin, swimming in the pool, kayaking in the pond, and relaxing in hammocks on the porch by the river. The cabin itself was really unique and had very neat features, not too mention extraordinary wood and stonework throughout. Can't wait to come back next time when our littlest ones are a bit bigger, and stay longer! Huge thanks to Janice for her warm hospitality."
7003,111,"This is a spectacular location and Janice and Tom have gone above and beyond. The home was extremely comfortable, clean and loaded with everything we needed for our stay down to shampoo and conditioner.
Besides the pool, fire pit, trails, water fall, ponds, animals, bird houses and bee pit stops (thats what I call them) the deck by the water is mesmerizing. There is so much more to see that I did not have a chance to see. There is no doubt I will be back for the peace and relaxation their home has given me. I highly recommend Janice and Toms home."
7004,111,"Wonderful cabin, wonderful property, lovely owners, fantastic communication! Thank you"
7005,111,"Janice and Tom's cabin makes for a perfectly relaxing retreat. It is everything seen in their listing and more. Incredibly hospitable and helpful, the property is beautiful, the cabin is amazing. We enjoyed everything about the cabin, especially sitting out on the porch listening to the creek. I would love to return for another getaway with my family. I found this listing looking for a place close to the zoo, which is in close proximity and very convenient."
7006,111,"Wonderful experience! Great cabin, welcoming hosts, and a property with everything. Loved every minute."
7007,111,This beautiful cabin is exactly as described! I was looking for a peaceful getaway to surprise my husband with to celebrate our 18th wedding anniversary. I'm confident I could not have found a better location! We will visit this hidden treasure again. Janice and Tom are wonderful hosts!
7008,111,"Where does our family begin? We traveled to Janice and Tom’s beautiful cabin and property to celebrate our daughter’s 11th birthday. It was perfect! The cabin itself was in a great location—easily accessible to the property/road but also private. The quiet and peaceful back porch overlooking the creek was exactly what we needed to unplug. Our kids loved the loft area and the side-by-side beds. And of course the pool (which itself has a great view of the farm!).

Janice was kind enough to bring us eggs and local bakery sweets the day we arrived, and Tom expanded our knowledge on sustainable farming for a few hours (also a kid favorite) one morning. Our family enjoyed exploring the property by foot everyday. After one particularly long day visiting the zoo, we were happy to sit on the back porch, listen to the creek, rock in the rocking chairs, and listen to cicadas. We will absolutely come back again."
7009,111,"The home was absolutely gorgeous. The hosts were very friendly and responsive. We received a full farm tour and even got to pet the animals. During our stay the ac went out, and the hosts could not find anyone to resolve the problem, so it was a tad warm until the middle of the night with the windows open. Also, there were a few palmetto bugs that would crawl about at night. But overall, the experience was lovely, the home was unique, and the hosts were very nice."
7010,111,"The cabin was absolutely gorgeous. It was clean and everything you could possibly need was furnished. We enjoyed the farm tour, swimming, fishing and walking trails. We live local but while we were there, we felt like we were far away from home. We will definitely stay again."
7011,111,"This was an amazing mini family vacation ❤️ Janice ans Tom went above and beyond to make sure everything we needed was provided! The house was beautiful and spotless. The appliances were top of the line quality, the beds and sheets were so comfortable 😌 and the amount of love I felt they poured into their cabin was astonishing. I would totally go back! Don't forget to ask about the beef they have for sell its AMAZING! Also pet a cow ( with their permission)."
7012,111,"Absolutely fantastic property! Our girls really enjoyed the farm experience, nature, the pool, and the cabin itself. We loved our time there and hated to pack up and leave. I highly recommend this property to anyone who is looking for a great getaway! While you are there, buy some of their steaks and ground beef for some grilling...you will not be disappointed!"
7013,111,Absolutely beautiful stunning relaxing awesome log house can’t even call it a cabin spacious and Hall mark movie worthy .. Stunning views amazing laying in bed at night listening to the roaring River.. the wrap around porch seals the deal watching cows graze in the morning and turtles and river otters on the bridge !
7014,111,"As always, this place is beyond beautiful!
No matter what the weather is, this is such a special place. My family and I enjoyed the river while it was sunny and then we relaxed on the porch while it was raining. Watching the fireflies post rainstorm was beyond magical!! We look forward to visiting the cabin time and time again!"
7015,111,"⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️
We loved our stay. Janice and Tom made sure they thought of every detail for their guests. The place was clean, plenty of towels, dishes, utensils, and the pots and pans were of great quality.
Communication was amazing and the farm tour was so informative.
They have meat available for purchase and a manual with information which we found valuable for our stay. It had local dining options and fun things to do.
This really is such a gem of a property and it’s beauty will make anyone happy to stay! I appreciated having a covered carport and the Bluetooth speakers were perfect for listening to music while sitting at the fire pit.
The river was so relaxing to hear, the porch wraps around the whole house, and they have kayaks and fishing poles available for use! It had more than enough room for our family of 4. The kids loved the “loft” area and so did we since it allowed us to have our own space while they had theirs. ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️"
7016,111,"This was hands-down one of the best Airbnbs we've stayed at - beautiful, spacious, clean, and completely set up to let you relax and joy the nature around you.

The cabin itself is quite large, very clean, and comfortable. The wrap-around porch is awesome, and the porch swing and hammock were favorites of both kids and adults. We had a great time watching the bunnies and lizards from the porch, and checking out the turtles from the bridge over the river. The pool at the main house is also amazing (!), and Janice and Tom were super welcoming and helpful throughout our stay!

Asheboro's downtown is only about 15 min away, and there were loads of antique stores and food options to take advantage of.

In short, we loved this cabin, and will definitely stay here again when we're in North Carolina!"
7017,111,"This place is gorgeous. We enjoyed the pool and walks around the farm. To he cabin has everything you need, Cornhole, fishing gear and a hammock and much more, a very relaxing and quiet place. Janice and Tom made this farm very special. Thank you for a wonderful week."
7018,111,"We absolutely loved our stay at Back to Earth Farm. The cabin was just as described and the perfect amount of space for our family of 5. We spent hours just sitting on the porch listening to and watching the river, so peaceful! Our kids enjoyed fishing/kayaking in the pond and swimming in the pool. We also loved watching the cows and calves and looked forward to them switching pastures each morning. Tom and Janice were excellent hosts and always very quick to respond to any questions we had. They have truly thought of everything! If you’re thinking of booking this cabin, do it!"
7019,111,"Words cannot describe how great our trip to Tom & Janice’s ""Back-To-Earth"" farm was. From the cabin, to the pool, to the river and pond, the porch and everything in-between, all details were immaculate. The town of Asheboro itself was also amazing! Our memories of this trip will last forever. We plan to be back ASAP!"
7020,111,"Janice and Tom were so accommodating - amazing hosts. We lost power for a bit during a summer storm and Janice brought down battery lanterns and offered anything else we may need - but we were content grilling out steaks and red potatoes with the farm's grass fed beef and weren't phased by being without power.
The beef was delicious. The pool was perfect and was a great place to relax, but we equally enjoyed the creek by the house. Our daughter was thrilled with the ""moving of the cows"" from one pasture to the next and we even got to participate in weighing the young cows which was super cool to see. They take great pride in how they raise these animals and it showed with how calm they were. We had fresh farm eggs in the fridge and delicious pastries when we arrived. We spent a day at the NC zoo, but the highlight of our trip was the cabin stay and exploring the charming downtown area. We can't wait to go back and our friend's who saw our posts on social media asked for the link to book as well."
7021,111,"The cabin is simply stunning! It was the perfect escape for our family to unplug and unwind. Our favorite things were relaxing on the porch with coffee, walking the trails by the river and to see the cows, and watching the wildlife all around us. The pictures do not do this beautiful home justice. If you’re looking for a cozy place to relax and enjoy some quality time with friends and family…look no further!"
7022,111,"Both the location and the lodging were amazing! I rarely give 5 stars to any lodging experience, but the cabin and its owners, Janice and Tom, deserve all 5 of them.

This weekend was a perfect retreat, beginning with the stress-free checkin to the yummy free breakfast / desert surprise on the dining table. The incredible swimming pool, free firewood for the fire-pit and BBQ, the rustic yet VERY comfortable and modern amenities, free farm tour, and the most relaxing river-front porch setup we've ever enjoyed, made this trip truly special.

Janice and Tom literally thought of everything possible for our visit. We did not have to purchase any additional supplies to make amazing meals in the fully-stocked kitchen. We were even able to purchase an amazing steak from their farm, which was delicious.

Don't forget to ask for the farm tour! You will learn a lot about farming and the very special approach they take to caring for their livestock."
7023,111,Hi highly recommended staying here. Janice and Tom have created a wonderful country getaway but yet close things that you may need. Our family has stayed here four times and plan on keeping our tradition going at this relaxing cabin in the country
7024,111,"Our second visit to Back to Earth Farms! Location on the river is incredible, the serene sounds are wonderful. Great place to stay if going to the zoo or uwharrie state park. Janice and Tom always leave delicious pastries as a welcome gift. We’ve stayed in many airbnbs, but this one is our favorite!"
7025,111,"Our stay in the cabin was only 2 nights and we left wishing we had more time. The cabin's craftsmanship is amazing. The location next to the river is mesmerizing. We enjoyed our coffee in the morning and our dinner in the evening on the wrap around porch listening to the river. The kids swam in the river and enjoyed walking the trails of the property spotting wildlife. If you want a place to enjoy nature, look no further."
7026,111,"This is a beautiful, rustic property. I am from this area and was visiting relatives, so we were away from the property a lot and never got a chance to explore the features listed. Check-in was effortless, pastries from The Table (coincidentally my favorite restaurant in Asheboro!) were left to welcome us, and the place was stocked with coffees and teas, a snack jar, games, generic shampoo and bodywash for the guys. This is a working farm, so we had no problem accommodating when the property owner contacted us to make sure it was okay to be working in the area. Communication with the property owners was positive and responsive. This is a very rustic cabin, set back into a wooded area, so be prepared to have to wipe down porch seating daily. Our one complaint was that the toilet, which is attached to the downstairs bedroom, was shockingly loud and guaranteed to wake up the entire house at night."
7027,111,"The cabin at Back To Earth Farm is beyond amazing! 💕 the covered porch on the river total enchantment, the cozy cabin, wildlife, nature walks, Wow! Do yourself a favor and snag this one! Can’t wait to be back!!!!!
Scott and Terri Haynes"
7028,111,"This place is magical. A perfect getaway on a farm with beautiful pastures, a pond, a running steam with a beautiful sound. Peaceful, private and hand-crafted luxury. The house is a wood-crafted gem with lots of personal touches. The hosts are super great at communication and clearly want you to have the best stay possible."
7029,111,What a perfect experience! the location is serene and the hosts are spectacular! The sounds of the river will soothe the weariness of any traveler.
7030,111,We had such a good time at the cabin! We had everything we needed and more. It was so serene and relaxing. Janice and Tom were so kind. We will def be back!
7031,111,"Serene vacation to Asheboro! Clean, cozy, and quiet. Loved the sound of the river. Host were very courteous and respectful of our privacy. Wouldn’t stay anywhere else in Ashboro."
7032,111,"This cabin was even better than the pics and the description. It is a truly amazing place. Private, serene, with all the amenities…we’ll hopefully be back here again!"
7033,111,"Janice and Tom were great hosts. Communication was excellent. The cabin was as advertised- clean, well kept, and a great place to unplug and unwind."
7034,111,Secluded and scenic. Great place to escape and plenty for a family to do near by.
7035,111,"What a wonderful weekend at the most perfect place! Tom and Janice have a beautiful and private piece of property…the cabin is hidden in the woods overlooking the river and the cow pasture. It truly was home away from home with so many amenities…we loved all the thoughtful extras (pastries from a local restaurant, cold beverages, snacks, coffee , and toiletries) the hosts provided along with the thorough explanations about how everything in the house worked. There was plenty of space for our family of 4 and we hope to come back in the spring or summer to enjoy all the warm weather activities at the cabin!"
7036,111,"Such a beautiful and well-stocked cabin with gorgeous views from every window! You have to be vigilant if you bring little kids (mine are 1 & 4), but we still had a great time and definitely plan to come back."
7037,111,Amazing stay !!! Five stars for sure
7038,111,"Tom and Janice were such welcoming hosts! We were able to communicate with them throughout the entire week! And my hubby loved how Farmer Tom educated him on cows and the land! The property is absolutely beautiful and you can walk the trail they have provided around the farm. The steaks we bought were FABULOUS! The cabin was EVERYTHING AND MORE! It’s private and secluded which is what we loved! You CAN NOT beat the views from ALL sides of the wrap around porch (as well as the porches upstairs!). The river was such a wonderful bonus with its views and soothing sounds. The cabin was immaculate and equipped with EVERYTHING you could need and want! The king bed was so comfy and we spent every night cozied up on the couch with a fire as well as outside by the fire pit. We were able to grill out most nights when we were not checking out the local breweries, wineries, hiking trails (all over the Uwharrie National Forest), zip lining in Fayetteville! (SUPER FUN) and checking out the small town of Gold Hill (which I highly recommend!) Needless to say 7 nights was NOT enough.😩
We were heartbroken to have to leave this wonderful getaway!"
7039,111,"What a wonderful place to stay. The hosts stayed in touch and have thought of everything. I had two young kids with me and in addition to the pastries left as a welcome gift, the snacks were a life saver. The boys loved the “tree house” and the beds upstairs. Please bring a kids gate for the stairs but otherwise a perfect way to get back to nature!!"
7040,111,So relaxing! The perfect getaway!
7041,111,A beautiful home. So peaceful. Great location for a family or a quiet getaway. Cabin had everything we needed. Highly recommended!
7042,111,"This is one of the best cabins in NC. Very clean, private with great views of the river. (especially at sunset) Comfortable beds and fully stocked kitchen (pots,pans, Etc.) with everything you need. Janice and Tom were great hosts, and we will definitely be back. Kids had a blast watching the river, hiking around the cabin and making s'more over the firepit. It's 10-15 minutes from the NC Zoo, so it's a great spot to stay while visiting the zoo and makes the whole trip an adventure and will provide memories that will last a life time.Thank you, Janice and Tom, for sharing such a magical place."
7043,111,"Excellent communication; great hosts. A little less to do in the heart of winter but a warm and beautiful, relaxing place for sure. Can’t wait to return!"
7044,111,"If you are looking for the perfect place to unplug, this is the cabin! It's off the grid and very peaceful. Janice & Tom have gone above and beyond to create a relaxing environment."
7045,111,"The cabin is absolutely beautiful. Just what we needed. Loved walking in to the smell of Cedar. The walking trails are nice and it was so relaxing sitting by the creek. Great fire pit for chilly nights. The kids loved Farmer Tom and the tour. ( ages 8, 6 and 2). Would definitely recommend."
7046,111,Janice and Tom had excellent communication and showed their hospitality skills by leaving fresh eggs and an extra Christmas blessing of fresh pastries. We slept so well with just the sounds of nature all night. It was peaceful and a perfect get away to restore your soul. Highly recommend and look forward to coming again!
7047,111,Janice & Tom’s place is extremely peaceful. I literally slept 11 hours without waking up which is unusual for me. My husband and I enjoyed relaxing on the sofa with a fire every evening. We also relaxed on the porch listening to the sounds of the river. This place is perfect to get away from it all & let your mind rest.
7048,111,What a fabulous weekend getaway! I didn’t think that we would be able to find something this secluded and relaxing without driving for hours from our homes in Winston-Salem and Greensboro. This was ideal - a short drive yet completely off the beaten path. The cabin is so quaint and cozy - with a really pretty loft overlooking the living room. The kitchen is perfect for home cooking. The most delightful part of the cabin is the wrap around porch - with wooden rockers overlooking the river. A hammock adds to the comfort. We were only there for 2 days and didn’t take advantage of all the property has to offer - we were too comfortable in this charming cottage! But we will definitely return!!!
7049,111,"So hard to leave a review for something you'd want to keep a secret, for fear of always being booked. This place is amazing. It's just what our family needed. The owners are fantastic. The location is serene, private and great for outdoors people. The only complaint, the downstairs bed is hard. I recommend a memory foam topper. Also, if you have young kids, a couple of collapsible bed rails for crazy sleeping littles in the upstairs beds. We'll definitely be back there again!"
7050,111,Peace and quiet with all the comforts one might reasonably expect. Clean. Attention to detail.
7051,111,"The cabin is warm and welcoming with a cedar scent. Enjoyed exploring the property and relaxing on the porch. Easy access to the NC Zoo. The only non-stellar aspect for us was the firm downstairs mattress, but everyone likes something different when it comes to that. A farm tour would have been interesting if we would have had the time."
7052,111,This is a beautiful cabin and a fun place to explore.
7053,113,Super close to Asheville! Great private place and the trails close by we’re super fun. We will for sure be back!
7054,113,"This place was amazing. The cabin itself is pretty small, but perfectly sized for myself and my son. The shelves are filled with an incredible book selection. The location is just fifteen minutes away from several great restaurants and trails. The trail the cabin sits on was surprisingly beautiful and long. The water is also really clean and clear. I hope to return during warmer weather when we might can enjoy the water more."
7055,113,Such a cozy space! Make sure to check out the trail in the back before you leave!!!
7056,113,My husband and I loved the cabin. it was so cute. I loved looking through all the books. the trail was so beautiful. we hope to stay again the next time we go on a trip to Ashville.
7057,113,"Fantastically beautiful surroundings; you'd swear you're on a movie set. the cabin is cozy, and perfectly sized! the back patio is the real reason to visit: built in seating to watch Bull Creek, or sit a chair in the gazebo and watch the Ivy River flow by. the tree limbs have been cleared away so the dark night sky flourishes with star light, and the bats keep the mosquito population from being a bother.
Also, the drive to and from the highway is pretty fun."
7058,113,"clean, nice place, too quiet everything is very nice thanks"
7059,113,"Can’t say enough good things about the cabin, it’s adorable and RIGHT on the river."
7060,113,A nice little cabin right by the river. The ivy river trail was great! Although no tv but it kind of just fit the setting without one. We enjoyed the peace and quiet and the sound of the river flowing. Would love to come back in summer to get in the water!
7061,113,"This is our third stay here! As always, everything was just right, and we were able to unplug for a few days and hit the ""reset button."" Thanks for being such great hosts, and we can't wait to come back!"
7062,113,"my fiance and I absolutely loved our stay at Ceeva's cabin. it was exactly what we were looking for, a place to unwind and relax from the hiking and bustle of the city. 10/10 we recommend this place and we will definitely be back durng the summer months!"
7063,113,"In a word, the cabin was COZY. It is the perfect size and accommodated all our needs. The surrounding area was gorgeous with the rushing creek right outside that can be viewed from most windows. This was our first cabin experience and it was amazing!"
7064,113,We had an amazing stay in this cabin. We would honestly love to come back again! They have a covered deck where we enjoyed our coffee in the morning while listening to the river. There was firewood ready for the fire pit and a great selection of books inside. We felt right at home and had everything we needed. It was also a quick 20 minute drive to Asheville. Can’t recommend enough.
7065,113,The cabins was a nice experience. We enjoyed every moment we shared. We were able to enjoy the outside and even decided to have a nice dinner to enjoy the nice view of the creek. The cabins is very romantic and would definitely recommend to couples.
7066,113,"The rustic cabin was exactly what we were looking for. It was quite, reletively secluded, and offered all the peaceful nature connections we were looking. We definitely hope to come back."
7067,113,"Long story short, this Airbnb says “no Pets” because there is a “free roaming” dog. My husband and I have service/working k9s and the host gave us kind of a hard time about it. Was pretty rude and required that we check in and give them a “timeline” of our coming and going so they can ensure their “free roaming” dog and ours would not meet. (Which our dogs are certified, go with us whenever we leave and wherever we go and apart from that, stay in a kennel.) additionally, the cabin is NOT “secluded” as it is right next door to the owners and right off of the road. Lastly, the cabin was moderately clean, however, I did clean up quite a bit of crumbs all over the counters. There was no vacuum in the cabin but there was carpet and the shower tile could’ve been cleaner. Lots of lessons learned. Overall, a decent place for the price but I think next time we will find a different stay."
7068,113,It was a great little place to stay. The area around it was so pretty and the outside sitting area alone was worth it.
7069,113,"A gorgeous spot surrounded by the sound of running creeks. A cute, rustic cabin which has everything you need to relax for a few days."
7070,113,The cabin was great! It was perfect for our mini-moon. Communication was on point and the process was so easy! A great first experience on Airbnb!
7071,113,Very Nice Location
7072,113,"This quaint little house was a perfect getaway from city life. It was the perfect size for me and my partner. The gazebo deck area is situated by a creek and the sound of the water is great to have a cup of coffee by. The bedroom was comfortable and kept cool with the fan provided. The living area and kitchen suited all of our needs, and the lack of TV added to the rustic getaway feel. There is a trail through the property you can walk that is well kept and beautiful. We also utilized the fire pit, which the owners provided wood for. We will definitely be back if we’re ever in the area again!"
7073,113,"Such a great find! So peaceful and relaxing. The river in the background was wonderful to listen to, and it was secluded enough from the city that we truly felt like we were in the mountains. Will definitely be coming back."
7074,113,Nice place - cabin is as described with a nice sitting area at the back. Peaceful with the sound of running creek. We loved our stay and will hopefully come back again! :)
7075,113,My sister and I were in awe of this quaint little cabin on a beautiful river and a creek in front of the cabin as well! It was peaceful and quiet but yet only a few miles to town. We so enjoyed the deck that was lit at night and a fire pit too. Everything was clean and orderly. Ceevah and her husband were very accommodating. I will definitely refer friends and family to this sweet country cabin!
7076,113,"Beautiful location, so quiet and serene! The outdoor spaces are gorgeous, and the location is convenient for Asheville, Blue Ridge Parkway, and many miles of hiking! The cabin is the perfect size for a couple, and there is a wonderful collection of books there to enjoy. Don’t miss visiting the town of Mars Hill, it’s a very welcoming community!"
7077,113,The property is amazing. The deck out of the bedroom makes the cabin feel like a tree house hugged by the river. Fresh zinnias in artist vase were such a sweet welcoming touch. The bed was comfy and roomy for me and my husband. The shower was fantastic. We plan to come back - and have already recommended this cabin to friends.
7078,113,"This cabin is a quiet location, although it is right on a road. The trail along the river is great as is the private deck. There is a nice selection of books and games in the cabin.

The cabin could use a deep clean (for example, there was some grime around light switches and dust and debris in corners). You may be out of luck if you want to stream a movie - the Wi-Fi is super spotty."
7079,113,"With an over 90% occupancy rate in our cabin over 4 yrs, we’ve had just 2 guests in the last 6 months mention issues of connectivity with the WiFi. I’m sorry that Catharina was one that had a problem. In response, we have installed a new, faster router with more bandwidth capability. Our internet provider, French Broad Fiber, claims the fastest speeds in NC - 1GBPS upload and download. I can confidently assure guests that our network is indeed capable of handling your streaming or work related internet needs."
7080,113,we stayed here for 4 days and it was unbelievably peaceful. her and her husband were do responsive to our questions and just so nice. going to bed listening to nature was beautiful along with the trail behind the cabin. we will be coming back. do yourself a favor and stay here!
7081,113,"Perfect place for a weekend getaway! The cabin is tucked away by a river and creek, so you feel like no one is around even though Ceevah is close by and very helpful, if needed. Only a short drive to downtown Asheville. We would definitely stay here again!"
7082,113,We had a wonderful stay at Ceevah's cabin! The creek trail was so nice and the cabin so cute. We ate out on the deck when it was warm. Close enough to Asheville to see the sights but far enough away to have some peace and quiet. The little sign they did for us was a super nice touch!
7083,113,Secluded location by the river with an amazing deck. Responsive hosts just minutes away. Great place to stay while exploring the Asheville area.
7084,113,Great hidden get away ! Nice quiet & peaceful. Will definitely book again .
7085,113,Would recommend. Great cabin in the woods.
7086,113,Great owner response and willingness to provide anything needed.
7087,113,"I can’t say enough of great things about this Airbnb! It’s so cute, quiet, and only 25 minutes from downtown Asheville!"
7088,113,Amazing location in between two creeks! Nice rustic little cabin with the basic necessities you need and Internet. Beautiful deck and patio. And an awesome secluded waterhole less than a 10min hike from property. Owners are wonderful people and very nice and helpful. Thanks again David & Ceevah!
7089,113,We enjoyed our stay at Ceevahs cabin! It had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. Our favorite part was the porch! We also love how secluded it felt. Can’t wait to come back for another stay in the future!
7090,113,wonderful location. perfect for a weekend summer retreat and great hosts!
7091,113,The cabin was very clean and cozy. Only a short drive to downtown Asheville!
7092,113,Great space. Lovely sound of the river and creek running right outside... Like camping but the benefits of a house. Super responsive host. Hope to rent again next summer
7093,113,Peaceful place to stay enjoyed the river and even caught a few fish and listening to the running water.
7094,113,Comfortable cabin. Not super fancy but a nice place to stay that’s quiet. The stream that runs right out back is very relaxing and enjoy awhile sitting on the covered deck.
7095,113,"The setting at Ceevah’s was peaceful and beautiful. With the nearby river trail, the gazebo in the woods, and the river and creek sounds there is almost no reason to leave!"
7096,113,Incredible place with even better hosts. Had fun hiking the trails and enjoying the river. Ceevah and David were extremely helpful on multiple occasions. Will definitely be back soon
7097,113,Our stay was lovely. The area is beautiful and the porch looking over the creek was a wonderful setting for a morning cup of coffee. Would absolutely recommend and looking forward to staying again in the future.
7098,113,"We had a lovely stay at this sweet, simple cabin. Highlights are the lovely covered deck overlooking Ivy Creek, a well-appointed kitchen and bookshelves, excellent vintage wallpaper, cozy bedding, and plenty of great lamps/task lighting. We were thrilled to discover Bailey Nature Preserve nearby. Ceevah is a thoughtful and responsive host."
7099,113,Great little rustic spot on the river with easy access to town. The cabin is on a nice bike route too! We enjoyed the river & outdoor deck overlooking the river. You can Walk down the path near the bridge & across the street to see some little waterfalls too.
7100,113,"We absolutely loved this cabin. The decked areas cannot be beat, and we spent a lot of time out there. The location was beautiful right on the creek, a very relaxing get away!"
7101,113,"This place is fabulous! Back deck and gazebo and fire pit and Riverwalk are spectacular! the secluded cabin becomes less secluded on a hot day when the locals come to the swim hole, but the happy noises from people swimming are not a bother to me at all."
7102,113,Great place!
7103,113,"Our stay at this lovely cabin cabin above the creek was splendid!
Ceevah is doing everything right in this lovely getaway!"
7104,113,"A wonderful secluded cozy cabin in beautiful surroundings in nature. Ceevah and David were wonderful hosts and we really enjoyed our swim in the river pool and the lovely outdoor deck. A great getaway from a busy lifestyle and a good location for nature lovers, fishing enthusiasts and bird watchers!"
7105,113,"Its a badass place. Some bugs at nighttime ,but its private and relaxing."
7106,113,The cabin was amazing! The back deck was wonderful. We listened to the creek run all night. It was a wonderful getaway and we will be going back!
7107,113,Very rustic cabin. Very quite and peaceful. No traffic and nothing but the sound of a small stream across the road. The creek/ river below the cabin is shallow and clear. It is fairly wide and easy wade and to fly fish. Very few trout but there are small mouth bass that can be caught. There is a nice trail along the river that is an easy walk. I suggest some tick spray and a good check after a walk. It’s very pretty and there’s a good chance you will see a deer along the trail.
7108,113,I gave my parents a trip for Christmas! They absolutely loved it! They just enjoyed nature and wonderful eating not to far. Absolutely love this little cabin and will be coming back! Perfect reset!
7109,113,Amazing place and an amazing host! You cant go wrong at all with this cabin!
7110,113,"we had a great weekend in this cabin. it's in a good location, close enough to asheville but a nice secluded spot by a river. would definitely come back. the host was great."
7111,113,"This cabin is warm and welcoming. Very comfortable and communication with the host was timely, easy and very congenial. The setting is beautiful. I watched geese glide onto the creek from the kitchen window. I wish our stay could have been longer!"
7112,113,very private and beautiful setting!
7113,113,Superb setting. Awesome cabin. Pleasant People.
7114,113,Quaint and peaceful. Nice decks and views of the river on each side. Also enjoyed exploring the trail by the river.
7115,113,"A true getaway and close enough to Asheville to have access to anything you want.

Be warned, there is no cell reception starting about 0.5 miles from the destination so make sure you know your route before getting to the dead zone.

Well worth it as the wifi is solid so you have it if you want it once you arrive."
7116,113,.
7117,113,"An amazing location with flowing water on multiple sides, a super cozy cabin, and a host that went above and beyond. Can't recommend it highly enough, only about 15 mins to Ashville you get the benefit of seclusion and nature without being far from the city. Knowing it was our anniversary there was even a little bottle of bubbly and card waiting for us."
7118,113,"It was a lovely home, in a place to enjoy a bit of solitude. We walked the trail behind the house by the river, which was a very neat little path. We didn't mind there not being a TV, the wifi was good enough!"
7119,113,This is such a lovely spot. The sounds of the river so calming. We’d stay there again if in the area.
7120,113,Beautiful place to stay if you enjoy simplicity and nature. Very close to downtown Asheville only about a 15 minute drive. They have two bookcases so if reading is your thing this place is the spot to be. Perfect place to disconnect from technology for a while and relax.
7121,113,"absolutely loved the place, and the stay. it's a super nice little cottage. the trail next to the house is public, so there may be some passers-by, but everyone is super friendly, and the hosts were very helpful and accommodating."
7122,113,"A perfect place to rest and walk along the Riverbank, I recommend it without hesitation."
7123,113,"Great little spot, tons of nature around, and very private. Will come back!"
7124,113,Great place to rest and relax.
7125,113,Our trip was amazing
7126,113,"This is our second stay here and we hope to make it a regular spot for us to just get away.

If you want luxury this isn't your place. If you want simplicity, peace, quiet, and a chance to unplug - jump right in! You have everything you need! You're close enough to Asheville to eat at great restaurants and get provisions, but far enough out to enjoy a little solitude.

I highly recommend walking the trail near the house. It's not difficult and the meadow is quite lovely. The outside deck is such a great place to just sit and enjoy your surroundings."
7127,113,"a cabin so peaceful and serene, you won't want to visit Asheville. Use Uber Eats if you want food delivered."
7128,113,This house is amazing. It was absolutely adorable. My S/O and I loved the trail along the River. Everything is provided and Ceevah is quick to respond with any questions or concerns you may have. You should definitely check this place out if you want to stay somewhere quiet but not too far from downtown.
7129,113,We loved our stay here! The cabin is so cozy and warm with a great back porch. And their bookshelf is stocked with an awesome selection of books and coloring books. It is in a beautiful location and not too far from downtown Asheville. Would love to come back in the spring or summer to enjoy the porch and river view more!
7130,113,"So we didn’t actually get to stay because I royally messed up the booking! This was a Christmas gift for my husband and his brother to go an experience together and have a “guys trip”. I booked the wrong dates!! Ceevah was very understanding and accommodating!! Even though it was my mistake they were kind enough to fully refund the first nights stay without question! My husband and I were so appreciative and will definitely be planning a stay in the future. Highly recommend planning your stay here, just be sure and double check your dates!!"
7131,113,"We stayed while it was snowing and while it was harder to travel and there wasn’t much open, I still think it was worth it. The mountains are absolutely breathtaking dressed in a blanket of snow! The cabin was nice and cozy too, I hope to come back soon!"
7132,113,"Such a cute, rustic place. It is very much out in the middle of nowhere. There are a few houses, but this one sinks down below a wall for added privacy. The bedroom is on the opposite side of the house and has a private entrance with sliding glass doors and a view. A bottle of sparkling wine was cold in the fridge. It was quiet and peaceful. Not having TV was an added touch. It gave us time to connect. If you like puzzles, bring some. We loved doing them and listening to music. Hosts were always quick to answer and very accommodating. We would definitely consider coming back!"
7133,113,"This was our third stay at the cabin and we love it more every time we stay. We love the connection to nature there. It’s easy to get to, easy to check in and the rustic little cabin is warm and comfortable. Plenty of space for my husband and I. We enjoy the outdoors so much and the new deck and gazebo are the perfect extension into nature. The two creeks meet at the edge of the property so the sounds of those lull you to sleep at night. The hike up the river to the swimming hole is beautiful and easy. We plan to rebook for this summer, we will always stay at Mars Hill cabin when we are in Asheville if they’ll have us back!"
7134,113,Great place to stay! Very quiet and calm. Perfect distance from Asheville. You are in great hands with Ceevah.
7135,113,"Amazing weekend, beautiful cabin!"
7136,113,"Peace, quiet, and relaxation are what you will find here. Hearing only the birds and the river was a perfect way to get away from the everyday and reconnect with yourself and your loved one. You are close enough to everything bust still far enough removed that it's a perfect location."
7137,113,Had a great stay at the cabin. Very cozy and a great way to disconnect from technology.
7138,113,This cabin is beautiful & just as advertised. It has such a beautiful trail right off the back of the property and close to both Asheville and a lot of great hikes. Highly recommend!
7139,113,"clean, quiet, and serene. a nice getaway for a couple or a small group of friends. close to everything you could possibly want."
7140,113,The cabin was nice and the host was accommodating. We were surprised there was no TV in main living area or bedroom. Outdoor deck gazebo area was awesome. The cabin need a dusting and shower could have been cleaner. But overall it was a good experience!
7141,113,"I booked the location for a birthday getaway with my boyfriend, and it was the most relaxing place to stay. We were welcomed with gifts and a clean cottage. It was perfect and private, yet whenever we needed something, the hosts were fantastic and helped up! Absolutely loved it."
7142,113,"The cabin is nestled perfectly in the mountains. A beautiful view everywhere you looked. We loved hearing the creek/river so relaxing and peaceful. The pictures do not do it justice. The cabin has everything you need and the location was not too far from the Blueridge Parkway, Ashville, and hiking trails. Ceevah was responsive and helpful about where the grocery store and other places were. This was my family's first time in North Carolina and we fell in love with it here. We will definitely stay here again. Thank you for the most amazing Thanksgiving."
7143,113,This was an awesome stay! Exactly what I was looking for. The hosts were kind and helpful and the property is beautiful. I hope my travels bring me back one day!
7144,113,"This was one of the best stays we’ve had. Ceevah and crew were very responsive, and treated us very well. We were celebrating our honeymoon and my birthday, and our hosts gave us a small bottle of wine and chocolate in honor of that. When we asked about board games, they didn’t have any in the cabin, but David brought some down for us from their own place. It’s about 20-25 minutes from the hot spots of Asheville, and secluded enough to enjoy the peace of nature. Amazing."
7145,113,"This is a lovely stay! The cabin is lovely and there are so many personal touches. Best collection of books I have ever seen at a Bnb and the outdoor deck is gorgeous. You can head down to Asheville or into one of the parks, or you can hike down to the river and kick back here at your home away from home."
7146,113,"We had an absolutely wonderful time at this cabin. It was quaint and clean and was the perfect relaxing get away to finish off our honeymoon. We loved sitting and reading outdoors and listening to the rushing water. There’s a coffee machine and coffee and tea—enjoying a nice hot cup in the morning was a treat.
Also don’t miss out on the nearby “downtown” Mars Hill.
We’re already looking forward to a return trip!"
7147,113,"We had a great stay in this cabin. The personal host touches were very thoughtful and the creek flowing outside the window made it extremely peaceful. It was our first Air BnB experience, but it won’t be our last."
7148,113,"It's a great little vintage cabin. The deck out back and the surroundings are beautiful. We love walking along the river path, and it's within distance from many of the spots we want to see when we travel to the area."
7149,113,"This hidden gem is nestled in the mountains only 20 minutes from downtown Asheville! It had everything that we needed plus a fantastic view of the clean, clear river! The covered deck was perfect for hanging out to enjoy the view!"
7150,113,Lovely cabin - exactly what we were looking for.
7151,113,"Wonderful little cabin, with a nice easy ride to Asheville and surrounded by wonderful views. The deck outside is perfect for people who like to sit outside and relax."
7152,114,"We stayed here while visiting family in Pittsboro for a long weekend. The accommodations where exactly what we were looking for. David & Alicia provide a fantastic get away with a beautiful location. It is easy to see how much care went into creating this perfect 1 bedroom home away from home. Everything was clean & tidy, and well cared for. David availed himself to us to reach out if we needed anything and his communication was thorough and timely. We will stay here again and recommend to anyone who is looking for a place close to Chapel Hill area to give it a try."
7153,114,"We stayed here for 2 nights and loved our time here! We came after a busy wedding weekend and it was a great place to relax. We enjoyed the short trail walk to the creek from the house and appreciated the quiet. Our dog loved being off leash and hiking around the property with us. The property is beautiful and in a peaceful, secluded area. The house is very easy to get to from Chapel Hill as it’s a straight shot down Jones Ferry Rd. David checked us in even though we arrived late at about 8pm. He showed us around the property briefly. David provided us with essentials such as good coffee, oatmeal, and tea. We will definitely be back!"
7154,114,Perfection!
7155,114,I really enjoy this spot and can't wait to return again! Amazing host and location.
7156,114,"This has to be one of the most beautiful settings for an Airbnb we’ve stayed at. Peaceful quite woods, big trees, bubbling fountains out the window. The architecture of the place is unique, everything was very comfortable and felt very private. Kitchen and bathroom had everything we needed, bed was comfy. The 10 acres of grounds were peaceful and we enjoyed a morning walk in the woods with our coffees. David was super friendly and welcoming and we were lucky enough to get to chat with him a bit and he had so much great info about the area and the property, it really made our stay there feel very special. Highly recommend and I suspect we’ll be back!"
7157,114,"This place is the definition of serenity! David is an integral part of the experience, and he was one of the best hosts I’ve encountered on Airbnb. The house is perfect for a getaway or even a one night stay. I was lucky enough to spend some time on the land and it was truly a wonderful experience. The architecture and engineering of the property is marvelous, so be sure to get into all the details. David is like a family member, I’ll definitely be back the next time I’m in town!"
7158,114,"Great location, beautiful house, wonderful host. This was a great experience and a perfect place to get away. Highly recommend!"
7159,114,"I cannot say enough wonderful things about David and Forest Garden! I came for rest, restoration, and to inspire more creativity in my work. Forest Garden is the most beautiful, magical place! David is so dedicated to stewarding the land and is probably the most wonderful and accommodating Air Bnb host I've ever experienced. I will most certainly be back!"
7160,114,"A little piece of Heaven! David greeted us, gave a tour of the property and lots of interesting history on the place. Our space was beautiful and peaceful, well appointed and comfortable in every way. Super comfortable bed!
The surrounding grounds are spectacular, lovely walking paths through woods.
Perfection! I wish we could have stayed longer !"
7161,114,"Lovely house, lovely garden, lovely host. Even on a cold, rainy day, this place felt warm and inviting. The host provided everything we might need, and then some. We loved the furniture, the art and well curated book selection, the architectural embellishments, the fields of blooming Lenten roses surrounding the house, the peace and quiet. Chapel Hill and its wonderful restaurants are just fifteen minutes down the road. We won't hesitate to book this Airbnb the next time we are in the area. Wish we could have stayed longer."
7162,114,"‘Forest Garden’ is a gem, nestled in a field of Lenten roses, with garden water features creating an experience for all the senses when entering the lovely cottage. The beautifully detailed interior spaces, with views of nature in every direction, are well appointed and include all the comforts of home. David is a generous host, welcoming and a joy to talk with. We look forward to visiting again for more than one night!"
7163,114,"Retreat is the right word for this beautiful cottage in the woods! If you are looking for a place to feel renewed and inspired, David’s cottage is a great choice. I loved the attention to detail and beautiful design, and David is a host extraordinaire. I came for a solo retreat, to journal and take space from my family life, and it was just the quiet and rejuvenation I was needing. My only regret was not booking for more nights!"
7164,114,Hidden gem! Can’t wait to return. Very peaceful place to disconnect and decompress. The host was great and the ground was beautiful! It has everything you need.
7165,114,My Fiancé and I had the best time at David’s place. We brought our Goldendoodle and David was super accommodating. My fiancé described this place and magical and the best valentines getaway. We will definitely be coming back.
7166,114,Absolutely stunning property and house! The pictures do not do this place justice. I will definitely be back!
7167,114,"If you’re looking for solitude and a quiet place to reconnect with nature and yourself, this is the perfect place. Beautiful setting for this architectural stunner. David was an attentive host; filling us in on the history of the property and the surrounding area. He immediately made us feel comfortable and welcome.
Our three day visit went too fast!
Oscar (our mini schnauzer) is going to miss those morning nature walks."
7168,114,Absolutely fantastic place! I found my 2nd home! Lol! Definitely plan to return in the spring or summer to take advantage of the trails and forest.
7169,114,"If you’re deliberating on booking, STOP! GO ahead and book!! Such a beautiful, artful, healing space. More than I could have ever imagined!!"
7170,114,Had a lovely weekend stay at the forest retreat.
7171,114,Both the guest house and the location were a dream. The house is spotless (and very tastefully appointed) and it abuts a beautiful and serene forest with trails alongside a stream. David was a fantastic host. A totally perfect stay.
7172,114,"David's listing was so inviting and relaxing from the moment we stepped out of our car. He was a wonderful host and was very quick in responding to us for anything we needed. The kitchen had everything one needs to make a meal and David was very thoughtful and generous with the snacks, coffee, tea and breakfast items left for us. The bed was comfortable and the shower much bigger than it looks in the picture and the entire home is clean, comfortable, surprisingly spacious, and aesthetically and architechturaly beautiful. The surrounding grounds and pathways through the woods are indeed magical and incredibly peaceful. It was a wonderful opportunity to stay in such a lovely and private home and still be close enough to explore all that the Chapel Hill and surrounding area offers. I would love to come here again soon!"
7173,114,Arguably the most beautiful and relaxing Airb we've been to. Thanks David!
7174,114,"All good, Jack. And I hope to have your and Grace’s company again. Also, thanks for the invite to visit when in Austin."
7175,114,An outstanding experience. David is an outstanding host and we very much appreciate the time he took to answer any/all questions we had about the surrounding area. David's dedication to the property shows in the attention to detail throughout the one bedroom retreat. Anyone looking for a quick escape for some quiet time with nature will appreciate staying here.
7176,114,"It’s always nice to get off the beaten path and David’s garden cottage gives you the rare chance to do so without sacrificing any amenities. Nestled into the woods, it’s akin to stepping into the pages of your favorite story book. Highly recommended and worth any extra miles it may add to your journey."
7177,114,We had a great stay! David was a wonderful host and the place was beautiful. Highly recommend!!!
7178,114,This quiet getaway is just as described/pictured! You can't go wrong if you're looking for a quiet getaway. The short trail down to the creek is so peaceful and it was a great way to relax and get out of the city for a night!
7179,114,"David was a tremendous and caring host for my family and me. He was inviting, proactive, and generous with his knowledge and time. The home was beautiful, with intriguing details and set in an idyllic forest. We will certainly be returning to this peaceful and welcoming place. Thank you, David!"
7180,114,David was so sweet and very accommodating. We can't wait to come back!!
7181,114,"An architectural gem with a touch of whimsy. Plus, it's DOG FRIENDLY!

First of all, David is a friendly host who responded to our inquiries quickly. The cottage is remarkable! The construction quality and interior mill-work are simply amazing! This is not an ordinary cottage.

The cottage is a nice size and very well equipped. David doesn't want dogs on the furniture, but he thoughtfully provides a sofa cover so you dog can snuggle with you on the couch while you read a book. The small kitchen has mini-appliances (stove/range, refrigerator, and dishwasher) plus all the necessary dishes, pots and pans. The bathroom is larger than it looks in the pictures, as is the corner shower.

Situated on a large wooded lot, there is walking trail on the property. Our dog enjoyed walking in the woods. Even though the cottage shares property with David's house (a short walk away and visible through the back windows), it is a quiet, relaxing, and private retreat."
7182,114,amazing place. amazing host. amazing stay.
7183,114,"What a magical place, and so wonderful for our two dogs too run around. It was perfect, and very close to restaurants and dog parks and shopping in a beautiful area of NC. Definitely returning!"
7184,114,Loved our short stay at David’s place! David was very communicative!
7185,114,"Though our stay was short, it was well worth the stop. Forest Garden is serene and picturesque, an artful delight surrounded by natural beauty."
7186,114,Very peaceful stay. David was an excellent host. We loved being so close to nature!
7187,114,"The cottage was beautiful and peaceful, with plenty of room for my dog to explore off-leash! David was a wonderful host."
7188,114,Best host we have had! So much better than a hotel. The place is beautiful and engineered to bring nothing but relaxation and a break from the noisy city. Our host was kind to supply everything you could want for coffee and a good breakfast which came in handy for us as we flew into town and didn’t bring anything like that. We slept very well being secluded and woke up refresh to take an easy hike around the property that was beautiful. We hope to be fortunate to travel to North Carolina and stay here again.
7189,114,"We simply must stay here again. Best air bnb experience we’ve both had. David is a spectacular and kind host, capable of being sociable or giving us space when we wanted it. The property is gorgeous and David did us the favor of giving us a tour of its various features and buildings. We were celebrating a birthday and he took this into account when greeting us at check in (very sweet) The space itself is peaceful and clean and the kitchen is fully stocked. Very quiet. The walk on the path through the woods was pleasant even with the rain. Perfect escape from family chaos during the holiday :-) 10/10"
7190,114,"Check in was flawless, cottage was cozy and quaint. Perfect for a romantic getaway."
7191,114,"David's Forrest Garden is stunning, spacious, and serene. The home has everything you need and more for a comfortable stay. We stopped for two nights on our way from FL to VA. We visited with friends nearby. I would love to return for a meditation retreat. The tranquility and surrounding nature were an uncommon treat from our city lives. There is a little nature trail on the property too. David is genuinely a hospitalitarian. He welcomed us in and checked to see we had everything we needed. All of these were already thought of and provided, such as tea, coffee, cream, and breakfast items. The kitchen and bathroom were fully stocked, and the home was clean and beautiful."
7192,114,"We live in the area and sought a retreat from our usual bustle/grind and this was a wonderful place to land. Incredibly unique and stunning details, lovely forest to walk in and a very quick jaunt to Carrboro and Pittsboro for delightful meals. Highly recommend!"
7193,114,"David was the consummate host. His property is gorgeous, with natural wooded settings and serene views from every window. The house is perfectly appointed with every necessity and thoughtful detail. Those who appreciate good construction and architecture will revel in staying here. The space affords peaceful contemplation and feels worlds away from the bustle of nearby towns. David offered us perfect recommendations for brunch and was so helpful in getting us settled in on our first night. He gave us plenty of privacy, but was always readily available when needed. We loved our honeymoon stay here, and would love to return in the future!"
7194,114,"This elegant, amazing stay is beautiful and peaceful!"
7195,114,"Very tranquil, very clean, very beautiful space. I came here for a solo retreat to do some writing, and it was really the perfect spot to do some focused work and get inspired by nature. The bed was comfortable and I slept really well. The kitchen had everything I needed- and more! If you are looking for a peaceful, quiet place that feels remote but is actually very close to many wonderful offerings in the triangle area, this is your spot!"
7196,114,"The Forest Garden is a beautifully built space on a beautiful property. We loved spotting the frogs before they jumped into the pond. Perfect getaway, but still conveniently located - easy to get around to nearby towns and events. Highly recommend!"
7197,114,"Wonderful, peaceful, magical spot in the woods between Pittsboro and Chapel Hill. We would be happy to stay there again!"
7198,114,Very clean and nice property. The craftsmanship inside the unit is impressive. This includes the hardwood floors and crown moldings. Nice amenities included. Our biggest concern is that if you stay in this unit be prepared to decompress from electronics. Satellite WiFi is poor and sporadic. No TV in the unit which is fine but cannot use tablets or phones due to poor internet. Cell service is one bar too at least on ATT. Host is great and very responsive to your needs.
7199,114,"Hello, Bruce. I'm checking in with you after investigating with HughesNet, my satellite-based internet provider, about the connectivity issues you encountered while staying at Forest Garden, Their answer was that the account had exceeded its data limits, and as a result connection slowed to a crawl. What they failed to do was message that I needed to purchase additional data to restore what speed their service can provide!!! I'm upset both for your inconvenience as well as mine. When the service runs at the allowable speeds (25+ MbS) one can readily send/receive email; Zoom; and run videos, albeit not in HD (high definition). At the time you reported the lack of access it didn't occur to me that it was a deliberate slowing of service, something that could have been remedied within a few minutes. My deepest apologies."
7200,114,"This place is magical! From David’s kindness and hospitality to the charming cottage, thoughtful details, and serene forest setting, you couldn’t ask for a more peaceful getaway. Just a short drive into Carrboro, Cary, or Chapel Hill if you want to take advantage of fun shopping and great restaurants. Or just stroll through the surrounding forest and keep an eye out for all the wonderful “Easter eggs” like the butterfly benches by the creek or the gathering of angelic figurines. I will definitely be back!"
7201,114,This place is absolutely idyllic and David was a wonderful host. Definitely would stay again!
7202,114,"An absolute dream of a getaway for myself, my husband, and our two dogs. Forest Garden is a magical space of healing, and David is a wonderful host. We hope to return!"
7203,114,Forest Garden is a beautiful and healing space! David is an incredible host. David has such a great attention to detail. I did not want for anything! Thank you so much
7204,114,Very cool place to stay. David was very welcoming and showed us around. The house was comfortable and the trail through the woods was a big plus for us!
7205,114,"Beautiful, Artistic and Peaceful jewel box of a cabin just outside of Carrboro /Chapel Hill - David was an exceptional host for our recent stay in the cabin and had great local recommendations for food in the area. The cabin was an easy drive from Carrboro where we enjoyed dinner, drinks and a walkabout. In the morning we had coffee and a nice walk on the trails and enjoyed the woods and gardens that surround the cabin. We had a terrific visit and will definitely return when our travels bring us back to the area."
7206,114,"If you're look for a tranquil retreat, you've found it. Out of all of the Airbnbs we've stayed at over there years, the serenity we found at Forest Park is unmatched. The home and grounds are perfect, and one can tell that David has put a lot of thought and care into making every guest's stay an incredible experience. He also has lots of great tips on things to do while you are in the area. This is definitely one to keep on your short list of Airbnbs to remember."
7207,114,It was a perfect stop on our weekend journey wish we could have stayed longer and really gotten to enjoy the beautiful home and area around. It was such a peaceful night David was a great host made sure we got safely to the unit since it was dark during arrival and had everything perfect and ready for us. Will definitely be trying to come back if we are in the area again
7208,114,"Quiet, clean, charming, incredibly well equipped. David is likewise incredibly easy and helpful."
7209,114,"The absolute best experience we’ve ever had with Airbnb. David was the most attentive and helpful host I’ve ever had. The location is absolutely stunning and a perfect place to just breathe and take a pause from the rush of every day life. We had the most relaxing and rejuvenating experience and will definitely be back as soon as we can. The house was well appointed, the linens and bed were perfect quality and we slept with ease and the with the sound of nature all around us. A perfect getaway."
7210,114,"We have hosted an Airbnb property for many years and stayed in dozens of Airbnbs. David's listing is sublime, a textbook example of property and hosting perfection and one of our best Airbnb experiences ever."
7211,114,"Wonderful. So glad you were able to meet Robert and explore the land a bit. And, thank you for the invite. Let’s stay in touch."
7212,114,"A true zen refuge…beautifully designed & immersed in a picturesque, peaceful wooded landscape. This is a perfect place to escape the chaos & reconnect and recharge. To top it off, David is truly a one-of-a kind host. He has a warmth & wisdom that perfectly accentuates the experience. If your looking for a peacefully rich experience, this is it! Thank you David!"
7213,114,"This stay is a gem, David is a very hospitable and respectful host who has thought of everything needed to make your stay as comfortable as possible. The house is well stocked, clean, and nestled in the woods away from the distractions of day to day life. We enjoyed our stay very much and loved seeing deer and frogs in the morning outside the house! I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a much needed break from the busy-ness of life to relax."
7214,114,"David's place was exceptionally clean and well kept, beautifully decorated, well stocked, and surrounded by a forest of trees with a small pond in the main garden. The host communication was impeccable.
It would be pertinent for other AirBnB customers to note, however, that the place is not quite as private as the pictures suggest. The overview of the place does not include the fact that the owner's workshop is located directly adjacent to the property and the main house quite visible from inside the living room (in the summer). I was a bit surprised when I arrived given the previous reviews and pics (none of which show the buildings around the house).
Nonetheless, if this does not matter to you then it's truly a gem of a place. I have given it a 5 star review anyway because others may not necessarily be looking for perfect solitude...."
7215,114,"Forest Garden is a beautifully curated, cozy and comfortable space. The surrounding woods and nearby fountain are comforting and serene. The house is tastefully designed and modern, with a great kitchen and wide porch.

David was a super accommodating and attentive host and I can say enough nice things about him or the stay. Truly a little oasis in the forest."
7216,114,"My partner and I were in town visiting family and thoroughly enjoyed our stay on David’s property. The home itself is the perfect size for two people, and was a quiet respite from our otherwise hectic schedule. I would absolutely stay there again if I were to come back to the area."
7217,114,"Cannot speak highly enough about both David and the house. The house is truly amazing - comfortable, beautiful, peaceful - really just a perfect time. David’s attention to detail is remarkable - everything was taken care of and he made sure we were as happy and comfortable as possible. Highly recommend!"
7218,114,"Could not pick a better place to unplug and relax in nature. Clean, beautiful locale, will be back!"
7219,114,"The Forest House is beautiful, nestled in the woods, with ample privacy and calm. David was an exceptional host, giving you space but quick to respond whenever you need him. I highly recommend this beautiful place to anyone seeking respite from a busy world!"
7220,114,"This place is magnificent, and David is a joy of a host. Only regret is not being able to stay longer!"
7221,114,Catch ya on the flip side!
7222,114,"What a peaceful and lovely house! The space is tranquil, open and inspiring, and David’s attention to detail made my stay feel so special. Will definitely stay again. Thank you!"
7223,114,This is an amazing property and we had a wonderful stay at David's Airbnb. Our host was very helpful and courteous. He went above and beyond the average host to make us comfortable. We will come back!
7224,114,"David, I’m counting on you all returning!"
7225,114,"I didn't actually personally stay here (my partner did), but setting up the stay, making an alteration, and the stay itself were all great according to my partner, and they plan to go again the next time they have time off from work.

They described it as peaceful and magical, so I'd say you're safe to stay here if that's in the ballpark of what you're looking for. Cheers!"
7226,114,"This was the perfect getaway! The house was just what I was looking for to reset my mind. There are plenty of air bnbs near my home, but they are all beach themed. So to find this gem was amazing. The house was inviting, had everything I needed. WIFI was dependable. And this may be weird, but as I was growing up, my grandmother's home was styled and designed very similar and she had an area that was almost like a library. When I walked into the forest house, that's the smell that I got and it was incredible. It was relaxing and a nostalgic blast from the past. I am already saving up money to come back!

The water features were right by the bedroom window so you get lulled into a comfortable sleep to the sounds of water trickling. It was extremely soothing. The bed was comfy too! The shower was the perfect size with an amazing amount of water pressure!

David was kind and courteous. He would check in on me to make sure I had what I needed, but was also very respectful of the reason I was up there, to just turn off my mind for a few days!"
7227,114,"A, the legacy of Forest Garden comes from its original use: Betty Phillips who passed away a few years ago was a psychologist that saw clients there, and her husband, Robert, who still lives here, built it for her. There’s close to twenty years of healing in that space and the surrounding land. Wishing you health and happiness."
7228,114,"Davis was beyond hospitable. The house was so peaceful, and the architecture was beautiful. The sounds of nature and his water fixtures outside were so tranquil, we didn’t want to leave. Would love to be able to go back and stay again!"
7229,114,A great interior designers dream. So perfectly put together. Wanted to stay for the rest of the summer. Was a perfect surprise for my lovely partner for her birthday.
7230,114,"Wonderfully decorated, lovely place. We truly enjoyed our stay."
7231,114,"And thank you, Amelia, for your sweet entry in “Woodland Notes”"
7232,114,"Forest Garden was amazing ! It was the perfect solo getaway destination to tune out and tap in. The trails were easily accessible and peaceful , the ambient sounds of the forest and fountains mingling together (plus a hot cup of tea) were everything to start off the day ! David was an awesome host , he made sure I was well taken care of for my stay . He was knowledgeable and kind and very accommodating . I don’t write many reviews but this was well worth it !"
7233,114,"Thank you, Delona, for your kind words. I hope to see you again."
7234,114,"The forest garden was a beautiful little guest house. Very relaxing, crisp with detail, and cozy. David was a gracious host who was very accommodating and accessible if needed."
7235,114,"I’ve experienced hospitality around the world and know from conversations with friends in the hospitality industry (Ritz Carlton and W Hotel guest experience designers) that it’s the little touches and details that make for memorable travel experiences. Forest Garden is an absolute gem and, coupled with David’s gracious hospitality, it’s a stay that will be memorable for all the little details. If you’re looking for a place to get away from the hustle and bustle of city life to recharge and recenter, look no further. The grounds, the trails, the water features, the books, the art, the porch, the summer lightning bugs, and the beautifully designed kitchen all create a sense of zen and flow. It’s clear David has spent time in Asia, particularly Japan. I felt whisked back to Japanese ryokans during my stay. Thank you, David, for a wonderful experience!"
7236,114,"Julia, I’m grateful for the privilege to host you and others at Forest Garden."
7237,114,"This is a very special spot. Nestled in rich woods, it's as magical as you think it will be when you read the description. Located about halfway between Carrboro and Pittsboro, there's plenty to do nearby AND you feel like you're away from everything. David is extremely thoughtful and pays attention to little details that make things all that more comfortable. He's also a really nice person who checks in to make sure you're doing great and also provides you with plenty of privacy. Highly recommend this place!"
7238,114,"Many thanks, Justin, and I hope you make it back this way."
7239,115,"Jason and Robyn were very responsive and kind hosts! They made sure that we had plenty of instructions for the home and things around the area. The tiny home was very cozy and peaceful, which was exactly what we were looking for! There was plenty of land between homes so it still felt reserved. The hot tub, fire pit and swings were a great addition! This location is also only 30 minutes from Asheville, so we had plenty to do! Overall, we highly recommend this tiny home and these hosts. If we get the chance, we would love to book with them again for future trips! Thank you for making our 1 year wedding anniversary so special!"
7240,115,Gabriel-That truly makes our day! So glad we could help you celebrate and would love to host you again for anniversaries to come.
7241,115,"My wife and I stayed here and absolutely loved it. The back of the tiny home backs up to a small bit of trails, enough to allow your dogs to run like maniacs and enjoy the outdoors. The hot tub was fantastic. The outside of the tiny home has a lot of great seating, swing, propane fire pit, grill. The deck was really nice. Inside the home the mini split worked great. There are some DVD/Blue Rays, games, and books.

Overall it was a wonderful stay and we enjoyed unplugging from the world for the weekend."
7242,115,10/10!! Please please please please stay here. This was the most perfect place for us to vacation. It was clean and relaxing and beautiful. Jason and Robyn were great hosts. This adorable tiny home had everything we could have needed and more. Surprisingly a lot of space and storage as well. This was so much fun and we cannot wait to come back.
7243,115,"Beautiful little retreat spot! You can tell there was a lot of love poured into this home with all the finishing touches that made it special - amazing outdoor space with hot tub, propane fire pit, reclining swing, and a super cozy interior with books, videos and fully stocked kitchen. I airbnb a lot, but this was definitely one of my favorite spots that I'm hoping to frequent often! Any <5 star reviews didn't read the thorough instructions they sent ahead explaining all you needed to know to have a seamless stay."
7244,115,"I needed to get away for a few days and the tiny home was perfect! Nice and quiet with a fabulous hot tub, gas fire pit, a super comfortable swing for two and a gas grill. Everything was provided… just grabbed a few groceries and we laid-back and relaxed!"
7245,115,"Loved loved loved my visit! Can’t say enough great things about Jason and Robyn’s place. The location was perfect, close enough to downtown Hendersonville but still far enough in the country to be away from the city. The hosts thought of everything, my favorite was the hot tub! 10/10 recommend"
7246,115,"Thank you so much, Melissa! We love hear that you enjoyed your time. Come back soon-"
7247,115,"blue bird tiny house is a perfect place to hang out, location is great, and the host r so helpful and very friendly"
7248,115,"This was one of the best airbnb experiences I have ever had. The tiny house is perfect for a couple getaway. The space might be tiny, but it is the perfect size for 2. Everything was a great quality and very neat/ clean. Jason and Robyn are awesome; they reached out to us on multiple occasions just to make sure everything was going well. Reception wasn’t great, but they fully disclose that. The lack of reception wasn’t a big deal either because there are so many things to do other than be on your device. Our experience was 10/10, and I strongly recommend!"
7249,115,Beautiful place! Wish we had more time to stay! Would love to book again in the future!
7250,115,"Thank you, Tabitha! We would love to have you back!"
7251,115,Jason and Robyn were very nice. They responded quickly to questions I had and were willing to go out of their way to make my stay the most enjoyable one. Amazing people and an even better property!
7252,115,"The BNB itself was very cute and comfortable. However, we never had warm water for showers and had no cell service or wifi to let the host know. Total cost was pricey for the size of the space."
7253,115,"Lakin-We are sorry to hear about your experience. As we stated in the check in instructions, the cold/hot water in the shower are reverse from what you may be accustomed to. The water heater is a new unit and we feel confident that hot water should be available for all guests. And as stated, while we do not offer Wi-if and cell phone service can be spotty, we have found communication by text to be possible with other guests while they are staying in our tiny house. We hate we did not hear about the issues as they came up or have the opportunity to address them in the best manner possible."
7254,115,"This tiny home was everything we wanted and more packed into a compact package! We loved the location—it was a good distance to both Asheville and Hendersonville. Jason and Robyn were super accommodating, and we loved our stay overall."
7255,115,"The tiny home listing was accurate based on the provided description. Everything was clean and tidy with available instructions on navigating the home and it’s amenities. Overall the host was very responsive and courteous even allowing me to check in approximately an hour early. The location was nice but not much to do; however, a binder was provided with fun events and locations to visit - would probably stay again."
7256,115,My wife and I stayed here for a little get-away and absolutely loved it. We would definitely go back! The place was exactly as pictured.
7257,115,We had a great time! Jason and Robyn were wonderful hosts and communicated very efficiently. The place was very cutely decorated and cozy. We felt right at home. Wish we could have stayed longer!
7258,115,Jason and Robyn were so attentive and the attention to detail with all of the amenities was great! I was so impressed. The tiny home was very cozy and really a good central location to lots of sight seeing and things to do.
7259,115,"This tiny home was comfortable and has everything you need for a more private, quiet getaway! My favorite thing was the selection of movies and just cozying up with my partner and just relaxing 😌 definitely want to come back during the spring! Highly recommend."
7260,115,This tiny home was absolutely stunning! Perfect place for a weekend getaway!
7261,115,This little Air BnB was perfect! Very clean and convenient. Close to town with Jason and Robyn’s excellent recommendations on things to do. Lovely setup will recommend to anyone coming to the area!
7262,115,"This was our first time staying in a tiny house and the experience was definitely worth it. The home is put together very elegantly and there was ample space for my husband, me and our 2 little dogs. The house also sits on a very wooded property that is amazing for hiking. The cell service is very limited and Wifi is not provided so that is the only issue if you need to stay connected. But if you don’t mind falling off the grid for a few hours this is a fantastic little spot."
7263,115,So glad you you were able to get some hiking in and unplug! We are waiting on the cable company to complete the lines for Internet that they have placed—hopefully we will be Wi-fi connected in the new year. We would love to see you back the BlueBird.
7264,115,"Such a cute, sweet place! Really enjoyed our stay! Place had all the essentials and was very quiet and cozy!"
7265,115,"We absolutely loved staying here! We were only able to stay for one night, but this was the cleanest AirBnB we have ever stayed in. Everything was beautiful & updated, and the hosts were really great about helping us understand how to get there. Would definitely stay here again if we are ever back in the area!"
7266,115,Had an amazing time on our trip and staying in the tiny home was just perfect! Everything was clean and the house was decorated so cute! Our hosts were great with communication and supplying a guest handbook.
7267,115,"It was a very nice and cozy place to stay in for a getaway weekend. Jason and Robyn were amazing, making sure we felt right at home. They made the tiny home feel very spacious and included everything we have at our own home. Great selection on movies, games and even had a book that included recommendations of things to do that were nearby. I loved the fact that they checked in and were quick to respond to any questions or concerns we had during our stay."
7268,115,"Thank you so much, Jeanette!"
7269,115,"Excellent location, very cozy and clean home. We loved it!"
7270,115,Absolutely amazing!
7271,115,"Thank you, Rosaly!"
7272,115,You will not go wrong if you rent here. Its quiet cozy and peaceful. The owners were fantastic to work with and the place was exactly as listed.. maybe even better. Super close location for Hendersonville and lots of shopping and restaurants. Couldn't have ended our year better! We'll be back for sure!!!
7273,115,It was great!
7274,115,"We truly enjoyed our stay in Jason and Robyn’s tiny house! It was just as described, super clean, and had everything we needed for a little weekend getaway to Asheville. We would definitely love to stay again! It was raining all weekend, so we didn’t get to use all the outdoor amenities, but everything looked great. Loved our time here."
7275,115,"it was adorable. we could have stayed in all day. great movie selection, and a fun experience. cannot recommend more!!"
7276,115,"This place is every bit as cute, clean, and put together as advertised! The location is nice: in the wilderness, but still close enough to town. And Jason and Robyn were very helpful to us. Would definitely rent from them again!"
7277,115,Loved the place. Very clean. Just as described. Would definitely stay again.
7278,115,Very relaxing and not a lot of traffic on the nearby road
7279,115,Wonderful stay. Very close to Hendersonville and Asheville. The vineyard just down the road is awesome. It was a perfect getaway to unplug and relax!
7280,115,We enjoyed staying in this tiny house. It’s conveniently located about 20 minutes away from Asheville. Jason and Robyn communicated very well and made sure our stay was as satisfying and to our expectations. We highly recommend the hosts and this Airbnb.
7281,115,This place was so great! Loved the location and the hosts were great. So clean and cute!
7282,115,"The Bluebird is a magical and happy place 😇✨👌. I took a trip to stay here while the leaves were changes and the colors popped. You will not get service but the place itself is in the middle of all the bikes hikes, cleaned with no sign of dust and dirt and set up to enjoy the outdoors and beautiful mountains. BEST AIRBNB I HAVE EVER STAYED AT!!

Robyn and Jason were wonderful hosts providing local suggestions and clear and concise instructions. Don’t sleep on booking this and I cannot wAit to book next year."
7283,115,"A very quiet, comfortable and well stocked Tiny Home. Many interesting parks and waterfalls very close to the home."
7284,115,"Fantastic stay, adorable house and exceptional outdoor area!"
7285,115,This tiny house was a perfect relaxing getaway. Jason and Robyn were great at communicating. I would definitely stay here again.
7286,115,We loved our stay in the tiny house! It was very clean and had everything that we needed. It was a great location to everything that we wanted to go to. We loved the area it was in and it was a great time to disconnect and spend time with my husband!
7287,115,Loved seeing the first colors of Fall in this cute area of western North Carolina. Definitely will be back!
7288,115,Great place to stay. Lovely outdoor area.
7289,115,This tiny home is the perfect getaway. We loved the outside area with a swing and fire pit. Jason and Robyn were super great with communication. The home was super clean!
7290,115,"If you are looking for a cozy, quiet, beautiful and accommodating getaway Bluebird is the place! It was only 20min from Asheville and honestly a place that is so comfortable you don’t want to leave. The space is perfect and has everything that you need inside! The front yard is the place to be in the morning and in front of the fire pit at night! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and Robyn and Jason are super responsive and helpful! Highly recommend!"
7291,115,"Our tiny home stay was everything we could imagine & more! Perfect area, super quiet, and still not far from amenities. The perfect place to relax and unwind. Will for sure be back!"
7292,115,We throughly enjoyed our stay from start to finish at Jason and Robyn’s amazing tiny home. They were very communicative and had a lot of helpful insight about the “must-do’s” in the Hendersonville area as we were traveling from out of town. They were very prompt in communication but made the stay super easy as they put a lot of thought and information in the welcome booklet at the tiny home. The tiny home it self was very clean and had all of the essentials and made my husband and two pups feel right at home. We also loved the cozy feel of the home and area with having the the option to take a quick drive to downtown Hendersonville or Asheville for breweries and restaurants. Our two pups loved their stay and enjoyed all the new smells amongst the trees and trails surrounding the tiny home. Staying here was just what we needed to relax and recharge. We definitely look forward to our next stay!
7293,115,"Jenn! We are so glad you chose us and would love to host you anytime you are this way. I am delighted that you were able to put our ""25 Places"" list to good use. We are so fortunate to have so many fun options within so few miles! Thank you again for being such a gracious guest."
7294,115,cute house with everything you will need. great location.
7295,115,Awesome place! Will definitely come back.
7296,115,"Jason and Robyn’s tiny home is a true gem in the hills with everything you could ever want. If you’re looking for a quiet get-away in the mountains, look no further. I was traveling by myself and felt completely safe with lovely neighbors and goats. Communication was prompt and super friendly, despite me locking myself out. Book this while you can!"
7297,115,"Thank you, Johanna! We are always glad to help and would love to host you again!"
7298,115,It is a beautiful place and Jason the host is awesome I would highly recommend this place and would stay here again
7299,115,"This was a great get away. This was a nice place to stay. It had everything you needed inside the home that you will need. The home was very clean. We sat by the fire as well, very nice."
7300,115,"Everything was perfect. Excellent communication and clear instructions. Wonderful location and a peaceful, spotless and cozy house. We will be back as soon as we can."
7301,115,"Thank you so much, Chris! We are so glad you enjoyed your stay and would love to host you again sometime soon."
7302,115,"This spot was perfect for our time around Hendersonville. It was clean, quiet, and welcoming."
7303,115,"Or

Loved this place! We felt like we discovered the perfect hide away to unwind and relax after our long day in the mountains. The Bluebird had everything we needed and more. Drinking our coffee and watching the sun come up by the fire pit was special and such a peaceful way to start the day. The space was just as promised and so cute. And the bed was incredibly comfortable! We will be back!"
7304,116,The place was beautiful and we really enjoyed ourselves ❤️
7305,116,Thank you molly. It was a pleasure to host you and your family.
7306,116,"Amazing place to celebrate my birthday and anniversary w/ my fiancé , area was great Antoinette and Phil were very responsive! Great last minute vacation! Beautiful beaches and very private . Would consider booking again ❤️"
7307,116,Thank you for the wonderful review. You are welcome back any time.
7308,116,"We had a fantastic stay at Phil and Antoinette’s beautifully decorated condo. The oceanfront deck is a great place to enjoy morning coffee, afternoon snacks and evening drinks. The beach at this part of the island is wide and flat at low tide - perfect for long walks. The hosts were responsive and quickly answered the few questions we had. Beautiful place to stay at our favorite beach!!"
7309,116,Thank you for the great review Carol. And thank you for replacing the coffee pot.
7310,116,What a wonderful experience! I love this island and this placed was lovely. My wife accidentally broke a coffee pot and they were so gracious with us. Thank you for allowing us to stay at your beautiful place!
7311,116,We are so happy you enjoyed your stay. We hope to host you again.
7312,116,"Beautiful beachfront location. Close to all the shops and restaurants in Surf City, and super convenient to the bridge if you want off island."
7313,116,Thank you for the great review David. We are glad you enjoyed your stay.
7314,116,Beautiful views from the balcony! Could see the ocean from the kitchen and living room. Perfectly clean and comfortable beds! Would highly recommend!
7315,116,Thank you Tiffany.
7316,116,"What a wonderful condo! The view from the balcony is amazing. The unit is very comfortable, pretty & clean. The owners are so nice & responsive. Thank you to Phil & Antoinette for sharing their beautiful home!"
7317,116,"Had a wonderful stay in Phil & Antoinette's place. They checked in and made sure we made it in town and that we got into the apartment. The apartment has a beautiful view and in a good location - you won't want to leave the view! The apartment is pretty close and within walking distance of the islands main business center. The only issues we had was 1). getting into the gate on the first day, for some reason the code wasn't working, but it worked the next day and every day after and 2). the fob to the pool gate wasn't working either - my daughter was really looking forward to the pool because its so big, but we had to skip it. Overall it was a great place for the two of us."
7318,116,"If you are looking for a very comfortable beachfront vacation spot, you won’t be disappointed visiting Bella Mare. The condo is very comfortable and has everything you need to feel at home. The home has a very “beachy” vibe to get you in the right frame of mind. You are close enough to restaurants and shopping if that’s your thing but it is far enough away that you don’t have a crush of people at the beach. The best part though is the private balcony that overlooks the beach and ocean. It is made for spending hours sitting in high, comfortable adirondack chairs watching the surf and surfers. The water temp was perfect, even in late September, for swimming and surf casting. Return trips are on the agenda"
7319,116,"Phil and Antoinette’s “Belle Mare” was spectacular. The space is exactly as listed: clean, cozy beach decor, well appointed kitchen and supplies. Communication was excellent from hosts and check in was effortless. The ocean sounds and view from the comfortable patio were the icing on the cake. We hope to return soon."
7320,116,"I really don't want to leave a great review because I want to keep this gem to myself but that wouldn't be fare. This was by far the best place. Affordable, great amenities, and oh the view. I wish I could have stayed longer. This set the bar for me. Family friendly."
7321,116,Thank you for the wonderful review. You are welcome back any time.
7322,116,Wonderfully located condo on the beach and has pool access as well. Our hosts are fantastic!
7323,116,The location was perfect. we will book again in the future. Clean and comfortable stay. the owners were very responsive.
7324,116,The place was very clean and nice the view is wonderful best ever and very convenient location from the beach . I really recommend it Phil and Antoinette are really attentive and very quick to respond.
7325,116,We loved staying at Phil and Antoinette’s beach front condo. It was right on the beach and had a perfect deck where you felt like you were sitting on the beach. It was very clean and in a perfect location!
7326,116,"Wonderful condo, great location, clean and tastefully decorated.
The only problem with this stay is your standards will now require ocean front lodging:)"
7327,116,"If you are looking for a picture-perfect oceanfront condo with countless amenities, look no further!From the moment we walked in, we were in awe of the pleasant smell, top-notch cleanliness, lovely decor, and priceless location. From the fully stocked kitchen, to the linens for the beds, Phil and Antoinette have truly thought out every beautiful detail. The beauty and peace that come with this condo: priceless."
7328,116,We enjoyed our stay here for the second year. It is a great location. The condo is clean and well kept. They are very quick to respond to any queations you may have. Keep a look out on the beach you may just see them and the grand babies playing by you. :)
7329,116,"Antoinette was responsive and checked in via the app to wish us a fun trip and safe travels! The condo was absolutely beautiful!!! It was fully stocked with anything you can think of. The view was breathtaking! We sat many nights and mornings on the balcony just listening to the waves!
This was our first AirBnB and we couldn’t have been happier!!!"
7330,116,I’m gonna make this really easy for anyone who is considering visiting Surf City and booking this Airbnb. Go ahead and do it. This home is absolutely perfect. Comfy beds and a wonderful balcony. We managed to see dolphins and other marine life during our stay here. If you on considering traveling here let me give you some free advice. If you are not a seafood person stop at good lion on your way in and only plan on eating like one time while you are there. This is not a touristy location and we went during a very busy time. Stores and restaurants are very busy and it’s the only thing we would have done different. It’s not the hosts fault by any means but I just thought I should let newbys know.
7331,116,Very nice. Clean and view off deck is great. Phil and Antoinette respond quickly.
7332,116,"This condo was perfect for our family of 4. Our young kids loved spending time in the pool. We loved being able to relax on the balcony and enjoy the ocean at sunrise and while the kids napped. The beach access and pool were both very close when we enviably forgot something in our room. The beach was pretty clean, even when it was busy there was plently of space. Close to Surf City restaurants and the Pier. Parking is a little tight for larger vehicles, but just fine if you don't mind walking a little after you unpack right near your stairs."
7333,116,"We enjoyed our stay at this wonderful condo! It is beautifully decorated and comfortable. Located right on the beach, we had spectacular sunrise views every morning. We loved it!"
7334,116,"Y’all!! Look no further, this place is it!! Views for days!!! This is how to vacation!! The location is perfect, the views are gorgeous I could seriously live on the balcony!! The hosts are so super friendly and helpful and they respond quick! Thoroughly enjoyed our stay, super easy access to the beach which having a little one was key for me! The community there is so friendly and helpful. The place was immaculate and the hosts set you up very well for a great stay it was top notch, we are already planning our next stay!!"
7335,116,"Great location and an even greater view of the ocean! Close to the heart of Surf City, but we still felt like we were the only ones on the beach."
7336,116,"We arrived to a welcoming beach themed home that instantly takes your breath away with a true ocean front view. At high tide the water is virtually right underneath the balcony. Slept like a baby to the sound of the waves right outside.

Great hosts with clear instructions and prompt communication.

We rented this location as a couples’ retreat and it offered true tranquility. The beach is within steps, and feels very private. Even on peak weekend hours we got a spot right in front of our balcony; and during the week you feel like you own the beach it’s so quiet. You could walk about a mile+ down to the pier with most of the centrally located food and shops.

The only gripe we had is that this island is NOT pedestrian friendly in the least. Limited or no sidewalks, about two main roads with speed limits of 35-45mph. We came in hopes of possibly going on trail walks or longboarding to transit the island but it isn’t really feasible or safe. This has nothing to do with the amazing host experience but a good piece of info for travelers like us who can only take so much laying in the sun before we go stir crazy.

EXTRA NOTES:

Odd floor plan. comfortable stay for 2 in the master bedroom although it’s located on the back side of the floor plan farthest from the beach which was a bummer. Comfortable bed. A hallway twin bunk was there. We didn’t need it but would be good if you had a few kids. The couch pulls out but you can feel every single spring so don’t even try it. Great water pressure in the kitchen and bathrooms.

There was a lot of construction going on with the neighboring houses; and a lot of construction in general which took away from the island vibe and made me feel like I was back in Michigan.

Would Recommend. Would stay here again."
7337,116,"This was our families favorite stays. we ended up booking an extra night before we even got there, and all the tears she's by the weeks end made us so thankful we did! Antoinette was amazing at keeping in touch with me all along the way, checking in and being responsive! The view is breath taking, me and my little ate every meal every day on the deck. Words will never descriptive bonds I made with my family that week. Listening to the sounds of the ocean waves crashing, while making meals for my family was paradise. Thank you again for opening your beautiful home to us, for sharing your actual piece of paradise with my family. It is missed by us so much already!!!"
7338,116,Great location to everything on Topsail!
7339,116,"Amazing place, even better than it looks. The town is so quaint with still a good amount to do, I’d recommend it to everyone."
7340,116,"Clean, comfortable and excellent location! Ocean views are spectacular! Owners are quick to respond if you message them. Decor is beautiful!"
7341,116,Great 11 nights! Thank you!
7342,116,"Beautiful view from the balcony, private beach, and you can’t beat the price! My friends and I had a great experience here"
7343,116,Great place with a wonderful view!
7344,116,"Stayed from 3/3 - 3/10/22.. overall experience was great.
The condo development was very clean and very quiet. we heard absolutely no noise whatsoever from any of the neighboring units.
Within minutes of arriving i noticed a very minor damage to a refrigerator shelf. I quickly snapped a pic and sent it to the owners. The owners responded back within minutes stating that they were just made aware of it the day before ( it occurred from the previous renters ) *the owners prompt reply was nice.
I recommend that you bring a pair of binoculars.. from the balcony you can see miles up and down the beach.. out on the water is distant maritime traffic, Dolphins, Porpoise, Pelicans, and totally awesome V22 Ospreys and H53 Sea Stallions!
My only 1st world problems are as follows:
#1 The condo could use a few small lightweight foldable beach chairs.
#2 Only two bath towels were provided.. *maybe one or two more would be nice.

Aside from those two very minor issues, the condo was clean, well kept, smelled good, fantastic views, beautiful and very clean beach, the complex security gate and front door lock access codes were accurate.. owners were easy to communicate with. Highly recommended 9.8 out of 10."
7345,116,We had a great time at Bella Mare. We stayed here while we looked for a house to buy nearby. The view is amazing and the access to the beach was quick and easy. It was off season so things were very quiet. The unit was very clean and had everything we needed for a weeks stay. Hopefully we will return.
7346,116,"What a great place!!! The listing photos are great, but the view is almost overwhelming you are basically on top of the ocean. beds are comfy, the unit is well stocked, just wonderful!"
7347,116,Hands down one of the best Airbnb’s. Listening to the ocean waves crash as you sleep was amazing. Our stay was amazing. Don’t pass this one up.
7348,116,Condo was just as advertised. The owners responded very quickly. They let us check in and out when we wanted (was the off season but still extremely nice of them) They had everything you needed. I Would definitely recommend staying here.
7349,116,Our stay was perfect and the condo was exactly as advertised. The owners responded quickly to our emails prior to our stay. ❤️
7350,116,"This lovely beach condo is right on the water, and the view is awesome! We saw dolphins!"
7351,116,"Our family felt right at home at this oceanfront getaway, and the hosts were super responsive to questions when they came up. Fabulous view from the balcony, right over the beach. Kitchen was well stocked for cooking vacation meals, with a solid selection of spices & cooking oil as well as pots & pans & such. Our son loved the top bunk!"
7352,116,"Got the wrong check in details, so ended up at the wrong unit. But the owners were very responsive and got me to the right place quickly. The place was clean and in a great location. Would stay again."
7353,116,"Great place to stay! Beautiful view of ocean, very clean. Had everything you need available. Owners were accommodating and wonderful to work with!"
7354,116,Just as the photos depicted. Lovely stay.
7355,116,"We had a wonderful time at Phil and Antoinette's cozy beachfront condo. They were responsive hosts to any questions we had and even had snacks and bottled water for guests. Their balcony is the ideal spot to watch the sunrise or just to relax and listen to the waves. It was very easy to access the beach since their condo is located in one of the buildings closest to the beach. Early October was a perfect time for our visit - it was still in the 80's and lots of room at the beach and the condo's pool. Definitely would recommend. The unit is on the second floor so be prepared for steps- not a problem for us, but may be for anyone with mobility problems."
7356,116,No real problems. We just had a little trouble learning how to operate the TV.
7357,116,"This place is spectacular! Truly beyond my expectations. Normally places look better in photos than they do in person but this place looks just as great. I loved being able to use all the kitchen stuff as we cooked a lot during our stay. The view is just gorgeous. I will be back next year for sure! Parking was also great, there was always a spot for us close to the building."
7358,116,"I couldn't have asked for better place to stay for my birthday ""staycation"" than Belle Mare. This adorable condo comfortably accommodated my little family of 3 perfectly, and we wish we could have stayed longer! The views from the balcony were spectacular, as promised, the furnishings were comfortable and the decor was just enough ""beachy"" to remind you that you were on vacation, even when youre sitting on the couch checking emails. We had no issues with parking, and the codes provided worked every time. It was a literal 45 second walk to the beach, and the pool was very nice as well. The value of this beaitiful condo, given the beach front location, is absolutely amazing, and we would stay here again a million times over! Thank you, Phil and Antoinette, for being fantastic hosts and opening up your home to us.

Alisha Kilby"
7359,116,"Incredible place! Great view, beautifully decorated, the host are over the top accommodating and communicative!"
7360,116,"This is such a wonderful little coastal paradise to visit!
Phil & Antoinette have thought of everything, and are so considerate in the way they've stocked their home for guests!
I hope you all enjoy your vacation as much as we did!"
7361,116,Thank you so much
7362,116,The perfect place to rest and recharge! Sitting out on the balcony overlooking the ocean anytime of the day or night. Very clean and decorated very nicely. Another family left some sand toys that my youngest daughter enjoyed! Bring a headlamp and go ghost crabbing at night! If you like fishing go to the pier down the beach and grab some pre-made rigs.
7363,116,"We loved to stay at Phil and Antoinette condo.
We loved to be steps away from the beach, wake up every morning and have breakfast while looking at the ocean.
The condo has all you need to have a comfortable stay.
The owners answered quick when we had a question."
7364,116,Had a great visit and the condo was exactly what we anticipated! Great location and beautifully decorated! Phil and Antoinette have fabulous communication with their renters and their condo was incredibly clean! Excellent visit!!
7365,116,Great hosts! Excellent communication and very helpful! Lovely condo with everything you need! Absolutely GORGEOUS view of the ocean!! Easy access to the beach and a lovely pool makes it perfect!! Definitely want to come back!
7366,116,"Great location! Superb view and amenities. Would have preferred private wifi, as the wifi shared by the condo association was slow and unreliable. This did little to impact our trip, though. Would absolutely stay again. Already imagining our next trip to Topsail!"
7367,116,We loved staying in this condo. It was clean and beautiful. The views are amazing. There are 3 flights of stairs. so close to the beach access. Parking can be tricky but never had to park very far. We felt safe (3 women) staying alone. Family friendly. Overall great place to go
7368,116,"The only issue we had was with the wifi, but that didn't bother us since we brought plenty of books and wanted to disconnect anyway. This place is beautiful the pics don't do it justice! We had everything we needed right there. The pool is really nice, not crowded and plenty of shade."
7369,116,We just spent three nights here and it was perfect! The condo was beautiful and right on the beach. We had everything we needed for this to be an enjoyable stay. Antionette was extremely helpful and very responsive! I would definitely come back and recommend this condo to a friend!
7370,116,Amazing view and very clean.
7371,116,"This rental is fantastic for families! Clean, bright, and steps from the beach! A great way to stay ocean front in an affordable manner! The pool is clean and a great way escape the heat or take a break from the surf! Hosts have all the basics ready to go in the kitchen! Our kids loved the bunks and extra eating space at the counter!

We are grateful for a clean and easy space to tent for our vacation!!"
7372,116,"This is a beautiful condo in a great location. The place was very clean and the instructions were very clear and precise. The kitchen is well stocked and lots of attention was paid to the little details of the place. The view is unbeatable and the deck is a great place to start and end each day! Be aware that you need to climb 2 sets of stairs and you may need to park a good walk away. A cart of some sort would be helpful with unloading and loading the car. The bed is pretty firm, so if you’re sensitive to that, consider bringing a mattress pad."
7373,116,Beautiful view! Very clean and cozy condo. Great space and family friendly!
7374,116,"My friend and I enjoyed our stay very much. The condo was exactly as pictured, the location was wonderful and it is a great value for what you get. Being right off the beach was extremely convenient and Antoinette was very prompt to answer the questions we had. Thank you Phil and Antoinette for allowing us to stay in your beautiful rental! We hope to come back again."
7375,116,"This place was great! We traveled with our 3 small kids. We appreciated how close and easy the beach and pool were. Pictures online don’t do it justice. The location was excellent.

The condo was very clean and hosts were quick to respond to any questions we had. The beach was nice, some places on Topsail you can’t even walk the beach during high tide but not here, there was a good bit of beach still even during high tide.

We found the complex to be very family friendly. People were very nice and respectful. Not rowdy. We felt safe and comfortable here with our kids.

A few things to note. First, the WiFi was spotty at best- this could be a plus or a minus depending on the type of vacation you are looking for! Personally, it forced us to really disconnect so that was great, but had we needed to work from home or do virtual school it would have been a serious issue. Second, the bunk bed wasn’t very practical. There is no ladder to the top bunk! My 7year old had to pull up a chair and climb which wasn’t a huge issue but odd b/c the chair had to stay by the bed or she couldn’t get out. Also, the pull out couch wasn’t comfortable at all, the mattress is very thin. If you weigh more than 50lbs you would definitely feel the bars and have a sore back/bad sleep (my 4yr old didn’t seem to mind though).

Aside from those few things the place was perfect."
7376,116,"Amazing condo, great view of ocean on the balcony! Good place for a family vacation!"
7377,116,Really fine place! Right on beach. Lovely to wake up and look out to ocean.
7378,116,This is a PERFECT place to experience a beach vacation. We immensely enjoyed every aspect of the condo. Wonderful beach decor (and we appreciated the patriotic accents very much). Thank you to our wonderful hosts for promptly and patiently answering our questions before and Dufy our stay. We will definitely consider this location for our next North Carolina beach vacation.
7379,116,This place was all that and then some. Beautiful place with everything you need right around the corner from you! The ocean view was glorious! Can’t wait to go back and stay there again soon!
7380,116,"The outside balcony and furniture overlooking the ocean is a perfect Utopia. The furnishings indoors were high end as well, very comfortable, extremely serviceable, beachy but not over the top. Although we didn't use it, the pool is beautiful with a great zero entry for children. Getting in from the front gate was tricky, but access to the condo itself was easy."
7381,116,We loved our stay! The view was spectacular and the condo was beautiful.
7382,116,Had a great experience at Phil and Antoinette's place... Great hospitality with a remarkable view!!!
7383,116,"Amazing place in front of the beach. It will be very hard to find another places that combines so great fantastic views, the comfort of a cozy beach condo and easy access to the beach itself. I will definitely come back again."
7384,116,You WILL NOT get a better view or nicer folks! The place was great!
7385,116,Great place! Very family friendly
7386,116,Wonderful guests. We would host them anytime.
7387,116,Exquisite view and extremely nice condo. Loved the location. Hosts were very quick to respond and so nice. Would highly recommend.
7388,116,Absolutely loved this place! It is everything that I expected and more! We will definitely be staying here again and would highly recommend to anyone :)
7389,116,Nice family place right on the beach
7390,116,I rented both of Phil and Antoinette units for my wedding that we had on the beach outside our unit. Both condos are everything and more that they said and show in the pics. We are planning to make this a yearly thing for our anniversary.
7391,116,Our family had a wonderful stay at this perfect location. My kids loved the seashell tic tac toe board.
7392,116,Beautiful condo and great location.
7393,116,"Very cute place, we saw dolphins right in front of condo 3 days in a row! Wonderful place to stay."
7394,116,The condo was a dream! Very stylish and clean with amazing views of the ocean. Owners were great to communicate. Will definitely be coming back and staying here!
7395,116,This is the perfect condo for a beach getaway! The hosts were communicative and the place was cozy!!! Dolphin watching from the balcony made it a memorable trip; I will definitely be returning!
7396,116,"Staying there was a wonderful experience, the house is beautiful, all the amenities you could need, and it had an amazing view right on beach on the ocean. We will definitely try and stay there again!"
7397,116,"Book this condo if you have the chance!I! Being right on the beach is amazing, the condo was super clean, check in process a breeze and the owners were a pleasure to work with. I'll book again for sure!!!"
7398,117,Me & my children enjoyed spring break at this beautiful and peaceful cabin. Equipped with everything needed ! Sunset/sunrise was everything !! Although getting up the mountain was a challenge (the kids enjoyed the laugh 🙄😂) . We had a great time ! And will def book again !
7399,117,Nick and Patrick have done a great job with this airb&b! The view is great! It’s super close to the little town of Franklin and they give great restaurant recommendations! The place was clean and had everything we needed. Highly recommend staying here.
7400,117,Nice place
7401,117,Great!
7402,117,Loved my stay and would highly recommend.
7403,117,I brought my girlfriend and it was incredible they host and the cleaning service got together decorated the entire home for her birthday. She was in tears and I really appreciate them for the hospitality and time they took out to do me that huge favor. If this host have any other location I would only like to both through them. I always use Airbnb when traveling and this is my favorite experience and accommodation I ever had. I give this a 20/10. Ps. You definitely need a truck or something that can fight through rocks and mud to reach this bnb.
7404,117,Property though was nice and clean
7405,117,"Patrick’s place was exactly as pictured, private and dreamy. My partner and I spent two nights here and had wished it was longer! The space is beautiful and the views are breathtaking. Like any cabin it’s a trek up, so make sure your vehicle is capable. The jacuzzi, fire pit, and grill were great touches and are what made us select this property! The jacuzzi could use a cleaning, but otherwise was enjoyable. Also the recommendations provided were helpful, we drove about 30 minutes out to Glen Falls and saw 3 additional waterfalls on the drive over. Overall great stay, I would love to return with a group!"
7406,117,"We had a wonderful time at Patrick's cabin! Everything was as pictured and described. We loved the beautiful view, hot tub, and fully stocked kitchen. The cabin was also close to downtown Franklin, which was great. Would love to stay here again."
7407,117,"Couldn’t have loved this space more. It was perfectly in between downtown Franklin and downtown Highlands with such beautiful surroundings. I absolutely loved that they had a book of things to do around town, but also gave instructions on any questions you would have. The drive up the mountain was definitely wild but it made coming home more of an adventure. We stayed in the house a lot, and it was a great space to relax. We will definitely be booking this cabin again!"
7408,117,"While we had a lovely time in Patricks’s home, there were a few issues with some of the amenities. Thankfully Patrick was quick to address the issues and make up for it! Overall, the home is a dream vacation spot for a mountain getaway."
7409,117,"Very nice place, host was always responsive in a timely manner"
7410,117,"This cabin was great. It was everything that was described. Have to echo the bit about 4x4 and steep road. Only “issue” was a tree fell on the road right before the cabin, but Patrick was quick to call someone and in no time someone with a chainsaw showed up and moved the tree! Would totally recommend this to anyone looking to get away for a few days in quiet with great views of the mountains."
7411,117,"Super amazing host, very beautiful home with an amazing view. Had lot of fun and was able to enjoy the house. Definitely recommend for a nice and peaceful vacation !"
7412,117,"Our stay at this AirBnb was wonderful! The home is very cute, cozy, and secluded. The hot tub was super nice and there is even a curtain on the side of the deck for extra privacy. The beds were very comfortable and the showers were fairly big and clean. The hosts also recommend we go over to Highlands. It is only 30 minutes from Franklin and there are 3 or 4 gorgeous waterfalls we stopped at on the way. There are lots of shops and restaurants there we enjoyed like The Ugly Dog Pub. I do want to note that the driveway is very steep. That is mentioned in the description but we are not from the mountains so we weren’t quite prepared for how steep it was going to be. It wasn’t an issue, but I would not recommend driving up it in a very large vehicle or one that lacks 4WD/AWD. Overall it was a great stay, my 3 friends and I really enjoyed both the AirBnb as well as Franklin and the towns around it. I highly recommend!"
7413,117,"Let me first start off saying Patrick was an amazing host! Property was pristine!! I’m a real estate broker in NC and it definitely felt like it was a staged show home! Then when I read the welcome packet in the kitchen I found out he’s an agent as well, lol makes sense!

Had a minor issue with the hotub and they were literally out to fix it in 15 minutes, I wasn’t expecting them that quickly. Overall it was a wonderful experience and would highly recommend!"
7414,117,The place was amazing and it was a great little getaway thanks to you
7415,117,"Amazing cabin! We had such a great time. The views are beautiful. Extremely comfy beds and the most equipped air bnb kitchen I’ve ever experienced. Big hot tub that we spent half of our time in.

Just a quick drive to downtown Franklin and waterfalls.

Four wheel drive is a must.

Only two cons: the fireplace was not working (though they let us know a day before we arrived) and you have to drive your trash down the mountain to a waste disposal company who wouldn’t recycle our recyclables."
7416,117,"Perfect mountain weekend getaway! Very cozy, updated and clean home. Has everything you could need. Highly recommend!"
7417,117,"Beautiful property with an amazing view! From firepit to hot tub to the endless blankets, they had everything you need to stay cozy in the cold season!"
7418,117,"Really nice cabin! Loved all the touches throughout. Super clean, comfortable and stocked with additional towels and toiletries."
7419,117,"Beautiful views from the decks and out the large windows, the cabin makes for a really nice stay.
Do heed the warning about the drive up to the cabin, it’s a steep one!
The accommodations and recommendations are awesome!!"
7420,117,Incredible A-Frame at the top of a mountain. Place was well-kept and the little details really added to an overall great experience. Has everything you need from coffee and kitchen wares to a hot tub and extra linens and blankets. Would stay here again.
7421,117,Amazing place!
7422,117,"This place was everything we wanted in a Smoky Mountain getaway for the fall leaves! Perfect views from both decks, cozy spaces, great cooking kitchen, and so close to many great hikes. We'd happily come back again!"
7423,117,My wife and I had a wonderful time on our honeymoon in this A-frame cabin! Thoroughly enjoyed the view from the balcony and from the hot tub. We were a bit disappointed that the fireplace was not functioning while we were there we were not notified in advance that there would be a problem with it. But overall or stay there was wonderful. The wonderful views and the peaceful quaint town of Franklin were absolutely wonderful to visit. All-wheel drive or four-wheel drive vehicle is very much needed for this location.
7424,117,"Gorgeous views and great decor. You definitely need a four wheel drive or SUV/truck to get up the driveway, even in the summer, car wouldn’t work. Overall great experience, I’ll be back!"
7425,117,This is a great place to stay to enjoy the mountains of WNC. The views of the mountains and cabin are outstanding. This place ticks every box for a mountain getaway.
7426,117,"This cabin was perfect for the relaxing mountain getaway we were looking for. It was clean, comfortable, cozy, and beautiful inside and out. We especially loved having the gas fire pit outside and wood burning fire place inside. The views are incredible, and we sat outside for hours every day just soaking them in underneath a blanket. We chose this cabin because we knew we would be staying inside and relaxing for a lot of our trip, so we wanted something cozy and comfortable, and it did not disappoint."
7427,117,Property matched everything I expected and had an absolutely fantastic view!
7428,117,"Beautiful home exactly how it appeared in the pictures the view was really the best! would definitely recommend to everyone, the stay was awesome everything was perfect! The host was great at communicating and answering questions made it really easy for us to check in. Definitely recommend"
7429,117,"This was by far the best Airbnb experience we’ve ever had! The property and the view are 10/10. The house was beautiful and had everything we needed. Fire pit, grill and hot tub enhanced the weekend as well. Location is amazing. The drive to highlands is under 30 min and on a gorgeous road. All 3 bedrooms are awesome and the decks are great for hanging out. A frame design is stunning. Can’t wait to stay here again."
7430,117,"Beautiful mountain A-frame with Million Dollar View! Spacious, clean, comfortable and stylish. Great location - close to waterfalls, scenic drives, mountain hiking and restaurants. A pivotal role in one of our most enjoyed vacations ever! Recommended to numerous family, friends and coworkers. Plan to come again and again. Thank you for great southern hospitality."
7431,117,Beyond all expectations!! STELLAR!!! Pictures do not tell the whole story.
7432,117,This A frame house is hard to beat for a relaxing weekend getaway. It is very secluded and peaceful. The pictures perfectly portrayed the beauty of this house.
7433,117,"Beautiful view! Private, comfortable, very clean, nice decor, great attention to detail. We will be back!"
7434,117,"Very beautiful clean cabin with exquisite views of the mountains . This place is very nice, has everything you need and a HOTTUB! We were made to feel right at home."
7435,117,"Great A-frame house to get away and relax in! The views were incredible and the house had everything we needed. Franklin is a cute town with great restaurants and interesting shops to explore downtown. Overall our trip was excellent and if you're looking for a getaway experience with comfort and amazing views, this is the place for you."
7436,117,"This place is fantastic, super clean and great cabin with a phenomenal view. The hosts are very friendly and respond quickly. We felt very welcome and super comfortable during our stay!"
7437,117,Patrick’s place was perfect for a secluded getaway! The house was literally stocked with every thing you need and was very clean! The area was very quiet and only one close neighbor near by. The only obstacle I had was getting to the property in my Dodge Journey. I did get stuck a couple times. The best advice to give is to go up the hill without stopping or going to slow if you do not have 4WD. I would def recommend this place and would love to stay again!
7438,117,Thanks for staying with us Alexsis glad to hear you enjoyed your stay. We do clearly state within the listing multiple times that a 4WD or AWD vehicle is strongly recommended due to the grade of the road up to the cabin. Unfortunate to receive a review based on this information but glad you were eventually able to make it up the road!
7439,117,"Amazing view, wonderfully clean space, solid internet, great hosts with quick communication. Would definitely recommend!"
7440,119,We absolutely loved this place!! Will stay here again! Tastefully decorated. Cooked in a few times and had everything we needed! Highly recommend.
7441,119,"The cottage was great, quirky and very cute just the way we like! We loved all of the nature right beside us. It was also in a very quiet and nice neighborhood. We would love for you to host us again.
Thank you..."
7442,119,The HoriZen was a unique and memorable Airbnb experience due to the view and location. Pam was very responsive and accessible. I would recommend this place to anyone!
7443,119,"The cottage was cozy and the views were gorgeous! Seeing the dolphins go by was an added treat. Pam was a very kind host, friendly and quick to respond."
7444,119,Great get away. Lovely location. Beautiful two days in February.
7445,119,Pam was a great host and very communicative. It’s nice to have the entire place by yourself and it’s a very quiet and peaceful area. Zen is a reality here!
7446,119,We ALWAYS love our stay at Pam's cottage on the Intercoastal - it's a perfect getaway for my daughter and I! The size of the cottage is perfect for the two of us and the sunrises are amazing! Highly recommend!
7447,119,"This house and location is perfect for a quiet getaway. It is located between Wilmington/Wrightsville and Topsail on a dead end street.

It is quiet, cozy and full of character as this home was built in 1947. The kitchen and bathroom are modern and balance the old wooden floors, walls and ceilings.

There is a wall of glass that face the water and the views are amazing. None of the photos capture how beautiful it is.

You will not be disappointed and most likely fall in love with this place as soon as you walk inside."
7448,119,We enjoyed this peaceful oasis! Beautiful views you just have to see to believe! Welcoming interior of this quaint cottage.
7449,119,"Outstanding accommodations and breathtaking surroundings! We loved everything about this off-the-beaten-path location on the waterway. This charming nook is full of surprises! Booking this cottage will be on our calendar again and again. Highly recommend for a romantic getaway, sisterhood bonding time, mother-daughter adventure, a solo excursion, outdoor lovers, kayakers, canoeing enthusiasts, photography buffs and fishing fans. It’s got a little bit of everything you’d want by the water!"
7450,119,"I was looking for a little getaway between Christmas and New Years, and was immediately drawn to the location of Pam's place. When I arrived I walked straight past the front entry of the house and down to the dock to stare at the water. This is one of the prettiest locations you'll find in the entire area, and you can literally see across the Intracoastal and marshes without a building in sight, all the way to the ocean. The cottage is perfectly sized with nice upgrades yet still has that rustic at home feel. This neighborhood is incredibly quiet and the cottage is at the end of the street adjacent to woodlands. The sunrise here is breathtaking. DO NOT HESITATE to stay at Pam's place and I can't wait to go back."
7451,119,House was nice and cozy and view was perfect. Was clean and very comfortable.
7452,119,The view is beautiful and the unit is very comfortable and quiet. Just what we wanted for a getaway weekend!
7453,119,The place is paradise.
7454,119,Loved every minute of it and hope to be back soon!
7455,119,"We spent a long weekend at Pam's place just to take a break from life, and I believe we found a great spot. It is right on the intracoastal waterway with nice estuarine views and even ocean views in the distance. It is at the end of the road so there is only one neighbor, so it is very quiet. Much of he character of the cottage is still intact with just enough modern touches to make it more comfortable. We did venture out to Topsail for a stroll on the beach, and down to Wrightsville Beach for their Oystertoberfest, but the best part was just sitting on the deck with our morning coffee and afternoon beverages. We grilled out Saturday and the kitchen was equipped with everything we needed. I fished both off the dock as well as taking my kayak out (Pam does provide kayaks but I brought my own fishing kayak), and did catch a few fish, and also saw a couple dolphin cruising the waterway. If you're looking for a quiet cozy cottage with a view, you won't go wrong with Pam's place."
7456,119,"Pam’s house is in a beautiful setting, right on the ICW. Pam is easy to communicate with, always responding to any questions promptly. The house was very clean and comfortable. Self entrance and exit couldn’t be easier. Phone reception is only fair."
7457,119,"Thank you to Pam for being a great host of the HoriZen cottage! We had a wonderful family weekend and enjoyed every minute of our stay. My husband and son enjoyed fishing off the pier, and out of our canoe. I really enjoyed watching all the birds-- snowy and great egrets, great blue herons, ospreys, pelicans, kingfishers, & cormorants! We also saw 2 otters, and dolphins swimming in the intracoastal waterway. The back deck is a wonderful place to watch the sun rise in the mornings.

The house was perfect and the check in/check out procedure was well communicated. Highly recommended!"
7458,119,We had a great time at this cottage right in the ICW. Very nice renovation with a lot of fun decorative details. Pam is a great host with quick communication to any questions. Would highly recommend!
7459,119,Cozy cottage with an amazing view!
7460,119,"This cottage was even better than we expected. Gorgeous setting, very cute with all the comforts of home.
We are big birders and saw all kinds of birds including a bald eagle! Would definitely stay here again."
7461,119,What a great little gem of a place. You can not beat the absolutely beautiful view at all times of the day. The cottage was perfectly appointed for a couple to enjoy this natural setting. I especially enjoyed kayaking around the Inland waterway as It parallels the natural preserve adjacent to the property. Peaceful and restorative.
7462,119,"This vacation was our first week long time away in 5 years! We so enjoyed our time exploring and relaxing the Wilmington, Wright’s like and topsail areas. Pam’s cottage was the perfect place to rest and spend time with family - the views were amazing - we look forward to visiting again. Pam went above and beyond to make our time there perfect."
7463,119,Such an amazing spot to stay and a really comfortable house to spend a few days in - we loved our stay!
7464,119,Lovely cottage with a gorgeous setting! Fit our family perfectly for 3 days while moving our son into college.
7465,119,"Comfortable, clean cottage with views for days. Close to ammenities and the beach. The whole family enjoyed our stay here."
7466,119,"The cottage is even more inviting than the listing! It is located in such a peaceful spot, but with access to many shops and restaurants. We loved having our morning coffee on the water and watching the dolphins swim by. I would highly recommend this home for its tranquility and reminder to appreciate everything."
7467,119,"The description did not disappoint. The cottage was charming and clean, with generous amenities. LOVE the stainless steel prep table and use of the canoe/kayaks. The outdoor area on the water side was lovely, with a spacious deck overlooking the spectacular inter coastal waterway. We enjoyed a tranquil breakfast and reading every morning, surrounded by nature; listening to the birds sing and watching the boats ride by. There was even a dolphin siting our last morning there. Pam, our host was great, and responded almost immediately to all of our questions, which was much appreciated.

Thank you for making our stay so special!

The Sterns"
7468,119,The cabin was quiet and really relaxing with great views of the intercostal.
7469,119,"This cottage on the ICW is perfectly comfortable, quaint, and stylish. We enjoyed the lovely daily views (morning & evening equally stunning) and we were treated to some entertaining dolphin activity, as well as some bird watching. This cottage was so peaceful and serene…it was hard to leave behind."
7470,119,"This is the most unique and cool AirBNB around Wrightsville. You can't beat the incredible views of the intercoastal! If you're considering multiple places for your stay and this one's still available - book it, you'll be so glad you did."
7471,119,Peaceful retreat with a stunning view! Everything was as described and even better. Comfortable accommodations and a very kind host. Highly recommend!
7472,119,Absolutely breathtaking views. A wonderful house on a wonderful hill. Very nice neighbors and no shortness of wildlife. Such a great place to escape to. 11/10
7473,119,"A little slice of Heaven is all I can think of to describe this cottage.
It may be small, but it’s full of charm and character. We enjoyed
sitting on the porch watching the boats go by with the dolphins tagging along.
It is a perfect spot for meditation and reflection.
It has a feeling of seclusion, although it is in a neighborhood.
A very quiet neighborhood.
It’s a sweet little cottage with a million dollar view! I would and will be renting this cottage again! Pam is a great host and very helpful."
7474,119,"Pam’s cottage was a wonderful romantic getaway for my boyfriend and I! The cottage views were beautiful to wake up to every morning. You truly can’t beat the view! Cottage was very peaceful and quiet. Just the weekend we needed!

The downtown area is about 25-30 minutes away, which had amazing restaurants and shops. We suggest renting a car if you’re flying in from the Wilmington airport.

If we ever come back to Wilmington, we would definitely stay here again! 😊"
7475,119,"This cottage is lovely and the views are amazing. One of our favorite places we stayed in. Very relaxing, but plenty to do for the one that does not want to rest. We will definately be back"
7476,119,Beautiful place! Just as pictured. Very clean and comfy. Neighbors are quiet but friendly. Perfect location from town and nearby beaches - about a 30 minute drive to beaches. Grocery store and dollar store 15 minutes down the road. Great views from inside and out on the deck/dock. We saw dolphins one morning. The canoe/kayak was a nice touch! Fantastic place to take your family. Beds were comfortable and the open concept made it family friendly. Would definitely stay again.
7477,119,A lovely home with a spectacular view!
7478,119,"We found Pam's place to be clean, spacious, and fully stocked with everything we needed. The furniture and beds were comfortable. We really enjoyed the front room which overlooked the intercoastal. Looks of pretty herons to see every day.
It was nice to be close to the beach yet be able to come back to our quiet and beautiful space. Highly recommend!"
7479,119,Lovely view! The kayaks were a nice amenity. We made good us of them. It’s a thirty minute drive to Wilmington and the beach if you are wanting to visit those places.
7480,119,"My spouse and I stayed at Pam's cottage for our anniversary weekend and it was exactly what we were looking for. The view off the back deck is magical- and I highly recommend waking up early to catch the sunrise. We enjoyed fishing off the dock, relaxing on the deck, and enjoyed watching the herons in the marsh. The views go on for days. The cottage was exceptionally clean and the living room/kitchen area was so comfortable to relax in after a day at the beach. We definitely plan on returning."
7481,119,Adorable beach cottage with the most calming view I could imagine. Perfectly decorated-we will be back!
7482,119,My husband and I went for our 10 year anniversary. We had an amazing time. We fished a lot off the dock. Then relaxed and enjoyed the view.
7483,119,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for a long weekend and had the best time! The cottage was easy to get to, homey, and beautiful. We loved hearing the rain on the roof and enjoying the beautiful sunroom and porch. The dock was great for fishing and just hanging out on. We had a great time!"
7484,119,"Such a great cabin! It's bright and airy and a very efficient use of space. The location right on the ICW is gorgeous and convenient. We brought our own kayaks and paddled through the marshes out to the bird sanctuary and some of the sandbars-- it was otherworldly. When we returned, pretty exhausted, the house was the perfect place to veg out to the sounds and the beautiful views on the deck. We will definitely be back!"
7485,119,Beautiful view!
7486,119,"Beautiful, clean, and open space! We loved this house and location, we paddled out towards figure 8 and saw some amazing wildlife including live sand dollars, several huge conch, and dolphins jumping out of the water on the waterway, but paddling against the current isn’t for the faint of heart so make sure you plan your time right and have plenty of water.
Also it’s a small thing but I hate living out of a suitcase so we really appreciated that the closet (with hangers) and dresser were open for use.
We definitely plan on coming back!"
7487,119,"This was a nice stay. Nothing special as far as the house itself goes, but the view was great. The cottage is certainly old and although it has been renovated it still shows it age, mainly the bathroom. As mentioned it’s probably not good for small kids as there is no bathtub, but never felt unsafe in there for them though as we traveled with with a 3 and 1 year old. Certainly not a 5 star luxury resort, but good value for the money. I’d recommend for a single couple looking for a quiet place to stay. We did get to see dolphins one morning and enjoy the lunar eclipse one evening. Didn’t spend much time at the cottage as we were out and about everyday, but I’d be fine staying there again if we came back to the area. Location was convenient for the activities that we had planned."
7488,119,"Nothing short of extraordinary. The view speaks for itself. If you can get yourself inside, the home is cozy with a full kitchen, smart tv, comfortable bed rooms. Also close to the beaches! Pam is responsive and answered all my questions during my stay. Highly recommended!"
7489,119,Beautiful views! Perfect for our long weekend. Proximity to everything is great and local marina eatery in walking distance. Bird watching was top notch too!
7490,119,What a perfect little place with an amazing view! We enjoyed taking the kayak out.. there is a nice area next to the house that is away from all the boats. We look forward to visiting again!
7491,119,"I’ve stayed at a lot of Air Bnb’s, and this by far was my favorite. It was a great place to get away for a few days. Very private with a gorgeous view, it was everything we could have wanted and more. I loved going to layout on the dock and reading on the deck. Also loved the quaint cottage with a modern vibe inside. Perfect place to watch tv on the couch and cook a great meal. If you’re debating between this house and another, definitely choose this one!"
7492,119,"Yasmin,
Thank you so much for your kind review and words. It is people like you that make hosting so much fun. You were a spectacular guest too! Please come back and see us soon. And, I hope you get that property on the water!! Many thanks again! Pam"
7493,119,Great place! The best views! Comfortable space! Relaxing vibes! Terrific host!
7494,119,"This is a wonderful place! Location is excellent and the cottage is light, airy and very comfortable. We brought our kayaks and launched them right off the dock. We hope to become regulars."
7495,119,"Great little cottage, well sited with great views from inside. Plenty of big windows. Modern kitchen, comfortable furniture. Kayaks provided daily trips up the intracoastal and out to Topsail island. Clean modern pier. With a large wilderness to the north there are many native birds who sit on the porch and stare at you. A peaceful and comfortable retreat."
7496,119,Incredible views and great cottage!
7497,119,Lovely cottage with everything you need for the perfect getaway.
7498,119,"The cottage is very relaxing and scenic, looks exactly like it does in the photos. The location is great and Pam provided lots of info before we arrived. Would definitely book again!"
7499,119,"This charming cottage is comfortable, clean and well maintained. The location has beautiful, expansive views of the intracoastal waterway. Sunrises and abundant wildlife can be enjoyed from the sunroom and deck. The cottage is private and peaceful, yet close to shopping, restaurants and not far from Wrightsville and Topsail beaches. Pam is a wonderful host, very responsive and helpful."
7500,119,This place is a gem. Amazing views and such a cute place.
7501,119,"We had an easy check-in at Pam’s cozy cottage. We enjoyed waking to the most amazing sunrise along the intracoastal and watched the peaceful wild life while having lunch on the deck. The place is so cute and comfortable. The rooms were clean. The bathroom is small, but workable. We enjoyed cooking in the kitchen and it was nice to have restaurants and other stores a close drive. A nice dock for fishing and bench to just relax. We highly recommend it for a peaceful get away and we hope to return to explore the area more."
7502,119,"Views from indoors are accurately described and amazing. Interior is cozy and nicely renovated. Location is convenient to shopping, restaurants, and just a few miles from Wilmington. Weather kept us from enjoying the deck or kayaks/canoes, but we plan to return in warmer months to take advantage."
7503,119,"Pam’s cottage is one of the most beautiful stays we’ve ever had! Pictures do not do this place justice. I felt like we were in a Monet painting or Nicholas Sparks book! Even in the frost and cold we managed to enjoy every piece of the property. If you’re thinking of booking just do it, you won’t regret it!"
7504,119,"You pull down the street past large, pretentious houses until you reach this quaint cottage at the end. You walk up onto the deck and you are mesmerized by the view, which is also available the entire time you are inside (if you can make yourself go inside)! The interior layout is perfect for hanging out and cooking and the 2 bedroom and one bath are clean and comfortable. The dock is easily accessible and there is a canoe and kayaks available (and the water is right there). We have stayed 2 times now and after each visit we have felt relaxed and re-charged. Besides the view and the abundant wildlife (wading birds, dolphin, and once an eagle), restaurants, downtown Wilmington, and the beaches are an easy drive, and there is a nature center with great trails just a few minutes away. If you like solitude, beauty, and quiet, this place is perfect for you. Pam and Mike are great hosts and we plan on coming back again and again!"
7505,119,Lovely cottage. Beautiful sunrises made our morning coffee time extra special. Hosts are 5-star quality. The quiet setting was perfect.
7506,119,"Pam had it all ready by the time we got there — the check-in process was as smooth as it could get, the cottage had all the amenities in place, and the view was just excellent."
7507,119,Absolutely perfect!
7508,119,"Absolutely loved this beautiful cottage! Amazing views of the water, lots of wildlife to observe from the porch (we saw dolphins!), and a beautiful home on top of that. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a quiet and beautiful place to stay while visiting Wilmington."
7509,119,"Amazing view of the intracoastal waterway! Everything was very clean, Great place to stay for a few days of relaxing! Would definitely come again!"
7510,119,We loved everything about this cute cozy comfortable cottage. It really did feel like home and you could feel yourself relax as you walked in the door. The views were just indescribably amazing from sunrise to the sky full of stars at night. We saw dolphins and caught fish and crabs and soaked in the sunshine and fresh air while we just hung out on the dock and relaxed. Amazing weekend and we can’t wait to go back!
7511,119,This is such a neat little cottage with incredible views! Waking up early to brew a cup of coffee and walk right out onto the porch to watch the sunrise was incredible. If you're looking for a relaxing getaway near Wrightsville then this is your place!
7512,119,"I can’t say enough good things about this little home on the Intercoastal waterway! The location was perfect, nestled at the end of a quiet neighborhood. The house was cozy, yet spacious, with a beautiful open view of the waterway from the dining area & deck outside! The kitchen is stocked with necessities to cook, and clean, and the bedrooms are comfortable! Pam, the hostess, was so easy to get in touch with before, during and after our stay! 10/10 recommend and will definitely be back!"
7513,119,"Great views with nice outdoor furniture & dock. Front room layout supports views, with windows on 3 sides. Great kitchen with all pots, pans & plates. Roomy shower. Saw porpoise, osprey, bald eagle, blue heron & snowy egrets. Nice sized bedrooms, WiFi worked great, stress fell away walking up to and through front door. Will return."
7514,119,This was a fantastic little cottage! The views were amazing and we took the canoe out & enjoyed the deck every morning. Thanks for a great stay!
7515,119,We enjoyed our stay. The views were unbelievable. The house was very clean. We will definitely stay there again.
7516,119,"Spectacular views, fishing, kayaking; the whole package. Pam and Michael do a great job with upkeep and response to questions and concerns. Well worth every penny! 10/10 will definitely be booking another stay again soon!"
7517,119,As described. A nice quiet get away!
7518,119,"Pam's place is absolutely beautiful. You can't beat watching the sunrise on the dock nor the proximity (25 min drive) to the beach. It was lovely, secluded, and very very peaceful. The place itself is beautifully decorated and filled with natural light. The walls within the home are very thin so I wouldn't recommend it for light sleepers or loud families but other than that this was an amazing experience. We were able to fish off the dock and there was no light pollution so the evenings were spent stargazing. Cannot recommend enough!"
7519,119,This cottage is really special. The sunrise views are beautiful. My family and I literally saw a small pod of dolphins swimming by and a bald eagle perched on a nearby tree. We took the kayak out and made memories as a family. Thanks for hosting us at horiZen Pam. 😊
7520,119,"The home was quaint, clean and quiet and the view was breathtaking. Definitely would stay again!"
7521,119,"Great stay, beautiful place. Thank you!"
7522,119,Lovely cottage with the best view. The HoriZen has everything you need for an enjoyable and hassle-free getaway. It's quiet and relaxing yet close to shopping and activities. We loved our time there!
7523,119,we loved our stay! We will be back.
7524,119,Had a great stay!
7525,121,Loved the hot tub!
7526,121,"Very nice, aesthetic and organised Airbnb. It was a birthday trip for my wife and she really loved the place. There was a nice hot tub and all the other facilities were perfect. Highly recommend this AirBnb!"
7527,121,"Extremely satisfied for the price paid, thanks to Tim and Carrie!"
7528,121,Loved it!!! thank you so much!!!
7529,121,Loved it! Cant wait to come back in the summer!!
7530,121,my girlfriend and I had a fantastic day. It was a very nice house and a secluded area for the hot tub. Perfect for a quick or extended stay in Wilmington.
7531,121,This was such a great find. A very cute place to stay. It was perfect for a weekend getaway!
7532,121,"The place was beautiful! Hot tub was even more perfect! I definitely recommend checking this place out! 5 stars all around, location is great!"
7533,121,Love the aesthetic of the place I look forward to staying with them again in the future. Love that they all have the same vibe and are just so beautiful and relaxing. The aura is top tier! Love this air bnb and know I’ll love the others they have!
7534,121,"Awesome place. Very secluded, hot tub was awesome, great space and would highly recommend!"
7535,121,We loved our stay! Great location and great host!
7536,121,Couldn't ask for anything better. Everything was prefect
7537,121,Excellent place! very easy to check in and it was nice and peaceful! would definitely visit again.
7538,121,Great place hot tub is amazing
7539,121,Nice house and hot tub
7540,121,Nice place. We would do it again!
7541,121,"The house was great, an amazing get-away for me and my boyfriend. Was much needed! Definitely would love to come back!"
7542,121,Enjoyed my stay!
7543,121,Great place to stay! Quiet neighborhood and fun house!
7544,121,"Great stay at a great place. Easy, efficient, and communicative."
7545,121,Hot Tub was amazing. Hosts were super responsive. everything was super crisp and clean comfy bed. In am planes and traffic was quite noticeable. but still all good!
7546,121,I would definitely love to stay there again!
7547,121,"Trully a beautiful and confortable place, close to restaurants and other activities."
7548,121,Very cozy and comfortable. Loved the hot tub setup and the lights overhead. Good stay!
7549,121,This is a great place for a quiet relaxing weekend
7550,121,great quiet spot. exactly what we wanted and on a nice quite spot. last house in the road so we felt nice and secluded when we wanted to (trying to get away from the city) but close to plenty of things to do and great places to eat.
7551,121,Great host and place was clean. 10/10 recommend. Definitely will book with Tim & Carrie again !
7552,121,The place is beautiful and peaceful. The two times we have stayed in the airbnb’s have been wonderful! Will definitely stay a third time given the chance!
7553,121,Super cute place! Nice little hideaway for a staycation or getaway. Clear communication and instructions. No complaints!
7554,121,"Perfect little place tucked away. Easy access.
Even more beautiful in person."
7555,121,"This was my first Airbnb experience and I was impressed! I have always been afraid I’m going to pay more than what it’s worth but this place was perfect for our little weekend getaway to Wilmington. We would definitely stay at another Airbnb of Tim & Carrie.

The only thing is the oven knob is broke off and we had to guess what temp it was on when we were cooking but it was nothing that was a deal breaker. The hot tub was my main motive and we got our use out of it! Plus we got some super cute pictures in the swing, so cute 😍"
7556,121,Very great place to stay!
7557,121,"The Zen getaway was nestled away in a nice spot. It was easily accessible and not too far from good food and things to do. The hot tub is a great addition to the place. Thankfully, we didn’t need Tim & Carrie, but they let us know they were there if we did! Great spot, great hosts."
7558,121,"Ok. So firstly we LOVE Tim and Carrie and have stayed at two of their Air BnBs in the past. The two we have stayed at were smaller and newly built. When we got to this listing, it was not as we expected from our prior visits to their other locations that are right down the road from this one. The only reason I give this place two stars was because of the mold issue. The hot tub was great! And the house is in fact, very clean as far as cleanliness goes, however, there was a point when you walk into the house that the air just seems thick and musty. I am someone who is very sensitive to mold, but even my boyfriend who is not was affected by it as well. You could tell it was a very old house that they just tried to cheaply remodel. We ended up leaving the house shortly after we went to bed (around 11pm ish) and drove home. Our throats and yes we’re burning so bad we had to leave. Upon leaving I walked down the hallway to the bathroom and could visibly see the black mold on the ceiling."
7559,121,Thank you so much!
7560,121,Thanks
7561,121,Loved our stay here. It was very peaceful and we were able to get some relaxing done in the wonderful hottub. Great location with great wooded views close to stores and such. The house was very clean and well stocked with necessity items. Definitely would recommend this place to stay 5 stars.
7562,121,The perfect place for a private weekend ! Loved the vibe and the outdoor jacuzzi with lights. The overall aesthetic made the place seem so dreamy!
7563,121,"It was really nice place, very recommend, very clean and comfy we loved it"
7564,121,Great place for a getaway
7565,121,It was a nice and clean stay really enjoyed it
7566,121,"Lovely space, extremely clean and tidy with a hot tub in the back with ultimate privacy 10/10 recommend!"
7567,121,Great stay! So clean and the hot tub was fantastic. Good location also. Will definitely come back!
7568,121,"We had a lovely stay, the house was spotless, absolutely gorgeous. It was easy to find in a quiet neighborhood we had everything we needed available with the added bonus the hot tub which was nice and relaxing."
7569,121,Great location and great price. Quiet area. I visit several times a year and will be back.
7570,121,Really nice! Very clean and host was very responsive. The location was good and neighborhood felt safe. The cleaning fee was a bit costly but they hire professional cleaners so you don’t have to strip the bed or clean before you leave like other airbnb’s. Overall would definitely stay again!! Thank you!!
7571,121,Such a cute place!
7572,121,"Very clean and very quiet.

5 stars!!"
7573,121,"The place was perfect for a short, quiet getaway. The check in and check out was easy, and the hosts was quick to respond to any questions we had. The hot tub was especially nice and relaxing! Would definitely recommend the place!"
7574,121,"I enjoyed Tim & Carrie’s small little get away. My wife and I enjoyed our stay very much we came in town for my little brothers wedding, we had a blast in the hot tub and made it that more spectacular. It was a little hot in the house but that is just because we’re in North Carolina lol. Still when the windows are open every thing breaths really nicely. Staying here really was the best choice. I highly recommend this place to anyone and everyone looking for a place to just escape or even longer."
7575,121,"This space was beautifully decorated, peaceful, and exactly what two tired parents needed to celebrate a birthday! The hot tub was perfect for the crisp fall evening and the house was conveniently located minutes away from everything we wanted to venture to. We look forward to having another mini getaway hosted by Tim and Carrie!"
7576,121,Great little place!
7577,121,This place is great! Would definitely return next time I’m in the city
7578,121,"I loved how convenient the location was, how easy Tim and Carrie were to communicate with, and how organized and visually appealing the entire place was! Very cozy and loved the hottub setup. Definitely will be coming back, looking forward to being hosted by them again! Best experience on AIRBNB so far!🙂"
7579,121,Good stay and love hot tub
7580,121,"The place looks just like it is on the site. Overall rating 6/10. Not the greatest but not the best. Not too dirty but noticed shower had a few pieces of hair from the previous guest (I’m assuming). Found a roach on kitchen countertop after coming in from dinner. House is pretty old, handle of the faucets were falling off in the bathroom on both sink and bathtub. It is a house split in two with another unit on the side so you’ll hear other people occasionally. Won’t bother you if you lived in a house/duplex/apartment with other people. It’s not a bad stay. Just letting you know what you may experience while being there. We have stayed with them before in a different Airbnb, so they have a variety of units to choose from."
7581,121,Very nice and clean in a quiet neighborhood! Great stay :)
7582,121,Wonderful stay! 10 minute drive to just about everything in Wilmington. Very private back patio space. Will stay again!!
7583,121,"Cool spot, unit is as described. Not far from downtown or the beach. Self check in was flawless and hosts were great"
7584,121,The home was clean and welcoming. We had a great time.
7585,121,This home is gorgeous and offered a lovely place to relax and reset.
7586,121,"Check in was a breeze, bathroom and kitchen were spotless. Sheets and comforter smelled just washed. Cute ambiance and very comfortable place to stay in a safe neighborhood."
7587,121,PERFECT STOP FOR A QUICK GET AWAY!
7588,121,Very nice place!
7589,121,We enjoyed our stay. Very quite and calming vibe. Place was also cozy and comfortable. We really loved the hot tub! I am definitely going to stay in this place when I’m visiting Wilmington next time.
7590,121,"Lovely place, comfortable vibes and is close to evrything"
7591,121,"Perfect getaway with everything you could need readily available.
The home was very clean upon arrival.
Being about 15 minutes away from the beaches and activities made things so much easier.
The hot tub is an incredible addition.
Could not think of a single issue if I tried to.
Would highly rent this space again in the future!
Thank you all so much for having this space to rent out to the world!"
7592,121,Great Stay! Loved the scenery!
7593,121,"Very cute little rustic Airbnb, perfect for a couples getaway. Only slight downside is it is connected to another Airbnb, so keep in mind you can easily hear movement and talking from the other side. Hosts were very friendly and understanding & communicated well! Would stay here again!"
7594,121,"Great location, and very comfortable stay"
7595,121,"Such a lovely house, and beautifully decorated! The hot tub was nice and the beds were cozy. And it was so affordable!! Definitely would stay again!!"
7596,121,"I really loved this spot and how private it was! This is a great location if you want to relax in a hot tub and not be exposed. A great spot for hijabis! Thank you so much for a beautiful stay, I plan on returning to this spot again in the future!"
7597,121,Had a great time!
7598,121,We spent 3 days at this rental and it was great spot between downtown Wilmington and Wrightsville beach. Clean and the hot tub was a nice perk. Would rebook next visit to the area!
7599,121,The hot tub is worth it!! Great Wilmington air bnb!
7600,121,Highly recommend staying here. It is in such a perfect spot in Wilmington- very close to nearby beaches & shops. This unit has everything you need to have a comfortable stay. Thank you Tim & Carrie!
7601,121,"Tim & Carries home was such a nice quiet getaway, tucked in, you forget where you’re at!"
7602,121,"Readily available for quick and easy communication, but I didn’t even need to reach out. The whole process was flawless for my first airbnb. Recommend this location to anyone looking in this area."
7603,121,"Everything about our stay and their house was beyond perfect and beyond expectations. Next time I'm in Wilmington, this will definitely be the place I want to stay. Hands down. No competition."
7604,121,This was the second time we stayed in one of Tim & Carrie’s properties and both experiences were great. My son loved the hot tub and the description of place was accurate.
7605,121,The house was very convenient for our event. We enjoyed all of the accommodations and Tim and Carrie were very responsive with any of our questions and comments. Will definitely keep this in mind next time we visit family in North Carolina.
7606,121,Super
7607,121,"Clean, quiet, and close to everything! Will definitely stay here again!"
7608,121,"Tim and Carrie were wonderful hosts! The location is super convenient, quiet, and relaxing for our Wilmington trip. Highly recommend this listing!"
7609,121,"This place is exactly like the pictures. The neighborhood is really quiet. Tim and Carrie made sure we had everything we needed for our stay and gave us clear, easy instructions for checking in and checking out. The hot tub was a really nice bonus. I’ll definitely be coming back!"
7610,121,Very nice quiet stay. Highly recommend.
7611,121,We were in a perfect spot to head downtown or to the beach. The host are very quick with their responses. We had an issue with getting the lights to work above the hot tub. The hosts were quick at responding and fixing the issue in under a couple hours. Highly recommend to anyone who wants a little private getaway close to the beach!
7612,121,"Our stay at Tim and Carrie’s property was great. It was very clean, in a pleasant neighborhood, and check-in and check-out was very easy! Overall a great experience"
7613,121,"Great location for 2 persons to have a weekend away.
Having the hot tub was an added bonus.
Kitchen is a little dated but has the basics.
Internet and streaming TV worked well, so good to relax at the end of a hot day.
Worth a visit."
7614,121,This place is phenomonal! Every bit of decor seems to have a lot of thought put in to it — and the hot tub / back patio made it feel like luxury accommodations. It was close to everything. We will be back!
7615,121,Very nice and private place
7616,121,"Tim & Carrie were great hostess. They responded quick every time I sent a message. The location is great, surrounded by a lot restaurants. The neighborhood was very quiet. I would definitely stay here again."
7617,121,Had a great time! Very private and nicely decorated. Hot ton was a great addition as well. Great location. Couldn’t recommend enough.
7618,121,"Quiet neighborhood, perfect for a relaxing getaway. Really enjoyed the hot tub"
7619,121,"Very clean, great atmosphere. Close to town but you feel remote. Excellent hosts."
7620,121,"cute, quaint and quiet. my husband and I loved staying here and can't wait to stay here again in the future. the hosts were attentive and quick to reply!"
7621,121,"I enjoyed my stay here. The instructions and communication were both great making it easy to set up while there. The instructions for the hot tub were easy and I got to sit outside in the back and play some guitar. The location was convenient to UNCW, which is where I needed to be the next morning. Will definitely look this place up again when I'm in the area!"
7622,121,"Quiet, clean, great location and hot tub is a real plus!"
7623,122,Great for a quick getaway!
7624,122,Thanks for the wonderful stay! The view was spectacular :)
7625,122,Very peaceful getaway
7626,122,What a wonderful place! We felt right at home. Kristin was so thoughtful to think about everything we might need and have it there ready for us! The house was beautifully designed and comfortable. We will definitely be back!
7627,122,Second time staying here and totally satisfied. They are very responsive and have a beautiful property. Will definitely stay here again if available. Don’t miss out on this hidden gem!!!
7628,122,Kristin’s place was fabulous. Everything was beautiful and perfect. She communicated so well and made us feel at home. Quiet location. Kristin was so nice and kind to us. Will definitely want to stay again and recommend 100%
7629,122,nice place to stay
7630,122,"Kristen‘s place was a serene sanctuary, and I look forward to returning soon! She was so hospitable, warm, friendly and made sure I had everything I needed and felt welcome. Sitting on the couch, the view was of sparkling waters open sky, and the sound of birds. I was looking for a place to retreat do some reading and writing and this was perfect. Krystine has thought of so many details, from the little kitchenette (fridge, toaster oven, microwave, utensils, Keurig coffee maker stocked with coffee pods) to the soaps, shampoos and extra toothbrushes in the bathroom. She is an artist and her place is decorated with colorful artwork.
I had coffee while taking in the view reading and writing, ate dinner outside on the deck, walked out on the pier and spent some time on the swing and the upper deck at the end of the pier. It was amazing & my soul is refreshed. This place is perfect for a personal retreat, serene, with wide open skies and the sounds of nature. Thank-you, Kristen!"
7631,122,"Lovely quiet place, beautiful views. Hosts were very nice and accommodating."
7632,122,"What a great place, very peaceful and great view of the river. Thank you!"
7633,122,Very cozy place by the water. Was very convenient to our duck hunting location
7634,122,"Beautiful location, helpful and responsive host. Would recommend."
7635,122,"Todd & Kristen were great hosts! The place is so lovely and scenic. I brought my dog along for the trip and he enjoyed his stay also—especially the deck and the dog treats Todd & Kristen left for him. :) It was a very cozy stay and everything was beyond clean and sanitary. There was a fridge and microwave to store and reheat food. There were utensils, coffee, napkins and plates provided as well. The view was stunning and communication with hosts was quick and easy. I will definitely stay again!"
7636,122,nice no kitchen
7637,122,"Kristen and Todd were spectacular hosts. My son LOVED wandering around the property with Todd talking to him. The location was OUT of this world! I spent hours on the dock sipping my coffee and looking at the view. They were flexible with both our coming and going. The decor was gorgeous - Kristen is SUCH an artist, and it shows in how she decorates.

This was a difficult trip for me, visiting my father in ill health, and Kristen and Todd's place gave me was peaceful and beautiful and their genuineness made us all feel so welcomed.

I cannot recommend their Airbnb highly enough!"
7638,122,"Kristin is a great host to work with, friendly and helpful. The place is just as beautiful. It is an amazing place to stay for peace and getaway!"
7639,122,"Very reasonable priced, get location, owners are great to work with and friendly. Looking forward to coming back soon!!"
7640,122,"My girlfriend and I had to cancel this trip due to her being sick. However, the Host was very responsive and helpful. We plan to try and stay again."
7641,122,Kristin is one of the most helpful and understanding hosts I've ever had. The place is just as beautiful. I highly recommend visiting if you ever get the chance!
7642,122,"If you’re looking for peace and quiet with a great sunset view this is the place.
Convenient to Elizabeth City and northern OBX
Nice place!!!"
7643,122,"I cannot recommend this place enough. Secluded with the most amazing view of the water from the living room. Plenty of sunlight and a private porch with tables, chairs and even a grill! Kitchen is stocked with all kinds of dining wear and even an assortment of coffees and teas. The living room has beautiful, vibrant colors and is full of books and games for when you’re bored. Access to tv, cable, wifi, a giant speaker and even a strobe light! Everything was clean and we felt so safe and secure at this location! Thank you Kristin for being a rockstar host!"
7644,122,Spectacular view from deck and dock. Great communication from Kristin. This was the perfect space for a relaxing weekend with friends.
7645,122,Amazing place to stay for peace and getaway! Would definitely say it’s one of our favorite spots to stay. Awesome view outside the patio with large space. Indoors was very clean and the area was quiet. Moon shines bright during the nighttime which make a better setting especially while sitting out in the pier!
7646,122,Kristen is a great host and her house is next level awesome. I will definitely visit again.
7647,122,Kristen and her husband are great hosts! Highly recommended!
7648,122,"Wonderful place to stay! We were in town for a wedding and had the bridal couple over to watch the sunset which was magnificent!! We would stay again next trip.

It was beautifully decorated and very comfortable. We had a small issue which was corrected immediately.

This was the best rental we have had.

I strongly recommend staying there."
7649,122,This is a great rental. The unit is very comfortable. The views are incredible and Kristin and her Husband are great people.
7650,122,"Phenomenal waterfront view of expansive Albermarle Sound, complete with an elevated deck for dining. This private accommodation was comfortable and amenities were well supplied. Kristin was very sweet, welcoming and attentive. It’s a bit of a drive through farmlands to reach the Outer Banks, but so nice to arrive at after days of sightseeing. I prefer it to congested beach locations, and my car was parked right next to the entrance. I walked on the pier many times and enjoyed the swing out there as the sun set. Very safe and quiet. I traveled with my dog and that worked out well. I highly recommend this property for your vacation stay!"
7651,122,"We had the most relaxing Labor Day weekend with our Coast Guard son who is in Aviation School. The view was to die for! We couldn’t take our eyes off of it!
Kristen thought of everything you could ever want and is an incredible host!"
7652,122,"A great Airbnb, the environment was enjoyable,safe, and clean!!!"
7653,122,The space was super cute and colorful! Loved the natural light! The beds were comfortable and the space was very clean! The view of the water was great! It was 25 minutes from downtown which wasn’t too bad. The host was super sweet!!!! I truly appreciated her above and beyond hospitality! Great spot to hang out for our girls’ night😊
7654,122,"A place to see wonderful sun-sets. The apartment is very nice and tidy. Kristin, the host, is very kind and was always offering help when needed. The location is beautiful but also remote. But we enjoyed very much staying there."
7655,122,The place is beautiful and luxurious. I really felt pampered with all the details and finishing touches Kristen provides. The view is stunning and soothing. Will definitely be coming back!
7656,122,"Beautiful home in a beautiful location, with wonderful hosts. We will definitely book again when we're in the area."
7657,122,"A lovely peaceful, unique getaway. Plenty of space, roomy bedrooms and a lovely garden. Great watching the sunset on the deck or pier. You definitely need a car, but the roads are very good.

Good size smart TV (so you can use your Netflix) with plenty of channels and on demand TV. Wifi slow but functional.

Really well appointed with all the essentials.

Weather was super hot when we were there (but AC worked well) so the Sound was too grassy to go in. There's not easy access into the water (no steps) so not sure we'd have gone in anyway.

Kristin is brilliant with communicating.

Overall it was a lovely spot to spend a relaxing few days."
7658,122,"Highly Recommended!!! The Host are very welcoming and cheerful,quick to respond and very nice. You have plenty of space, very clean, peaceful, the view from the inside and the balcony were amazing. Everything about the place is wonderfull. I will definitely book again !"
7659,122,Everything was perfect! Kristin was very sweet and gave us lots of tips regarding the area. The place is very cute! Thank you so much !
7660,122,"If u get the chance….take it! This is truly a slice of heaven! Very peaceful and picturesque! The view and the vibe are amazing! We loved the decor and all of the artistic touches. Kristin is an amazing hosts who truly has thought of everything. So many beautiful, thoughtful touches! We haven’t even left yet but already can’t wait to come back"
7661,122,"WOW! Kristin's home is as marvelous as her hospitality. Less than 30 seconds from the water, let us relax, fish and take in the beautiful view. I loved the colorful, energetic decor and attention to detail. You're going to love it here."
7662,122,"What a JEWEL....5 Stars just isn't enough! Between the beautiful views from the dock and the well appointed home...you could not ask for more! If you are traveling anywhere near Kristin's home...you'd be crazy not to stay here! We will definitely be back again, and again, and again...."
7663,122,"What a wonderful place to stay!! There is not much around in terms of restaurants, stores etc. but the backyard alone is worth the trip. It is very clear that tons of effort has been put into the decor too! Super cute inside and out."
7664,122,Just a wonderful experience and can’t suggest it enough.
7665,122,Kristin is very polite and a fantastic host. Beautiful home and a lovely view of the sound!
7666,122,Kristin and Todd are so welcoming! The place is perfect! It's right on the water in a beautiful location. We had everything we needed and more. It's so peaceful and absolutely beautiful there!!
7667,122,"This Bnb was AMAZING. It was very dog friendly, which was an amazing plus. The view is INCREDIBLE. The host is so welcoming, and provided everything needed.

Seriously, the sunsets are unreal. It’s about an hour and half from duck or kitty hawk, but for us it wasn’t a problem. This is the PERFECT weekend getaway!"
7668,122,"If you are looking for peace, quiet and beauty, this is your place !"
7669,122,"Kristin was an amazing host. Prompt to reply to any questions we had, and overly accommodating to us. She provided anything we needed and then some.

The location was a little further out than we expected but it was just fine. Downtown Elizabeth city had most of what we needed and it was an easy drive to outer banks.

We did bring our own griddle since there is no full kitchen and between that and the grill, it was just what we needed!

We will definitely be back!"
7670,122,In a very serene and quiet area with beautiful views of the sound where you can catch the sunset and sunrise. Great amenities and a comfortable sleeping space.
7671,122,"This is a great place with wonderful views. Very quiet, great hosts, and located within reasonable distance of all OBX amenities."
7672,122,"Kristin covered all the abc. Artsy, Beautiful and Calming. Off the beaten path and close to nature. About 20minutes to Elizabeth City downtown district."
7673,122,"Awesome spot, awesome views, great host
Would recommend to anyone, she’s so open and so friendly and communication is by far the best part in my opinion, thanks so much for the great hospitality!!!"
7674,127,"We had a wonderful weekend getaway. We enjoyed fishing, boating & sitting on the porch. An adorable cabin!"
7675,127,Thank you fir the great review! Please do return
7676,127,"The was a quaint little cabin by the lake, just as described. Fully stocked with most anything one may need. Or trip had to be cut short due to the exteme cold, the heat wasnt able to keep us warm and the water pipes frozen the next morning. I contacted Shane and Air BNB and they were quick to respond. They were very kind a provided a full refund for our stay. Our issues were merely weather related that none of us had any control over. We greatly appreciate that we did not lose all our money on a trip we had to abandon. Our Christmas would have been just so perfect if the weather had been better. We will try to return to vacation there in warmer month's for sure, its a lovely place right on the lake. Thanks Shane"
7677,127,"Such a beautiful, & quiet setting! The house was very clean & comfortable! We enjoyed sitting down by the water around a fire, walks on the trail in the woods, early mornings & sunsets on the porch while looking out at the lake watching birds, ducks & geese coming and going. The wood stove was a perfect touch (we bought wood from a local place not far away)."
7678,127,"This house is decorated so sweet with little homey touches in every room it feels like a hug when you enter the room.

Beautiful view of the lake from the wrap around porches. A great place to take a breath and reflect on your many blessings."
7679,127,Thank you so much! It was a pleasure to host you and Henry!
7680,127,C
7681,127,"Penny thank you so much for your stay! For some reason your public post did not come through visibly so I am sharing it… Thank you again..

Shane, What a great place! We had two wonderful days playing in the water. Having all the different boats was awesome. I even watched a pair of otters. So glad we found your rental property. Thank you! Penny"
7682,127,Beautiful house and landscape. Very clean and cozy. We had fun all night on the porch and the dock. Super private and all around good time. Like 15 minutes top to city yet so remote. Looking foward to going again.
7683,127,"Thank you
Thank you
Thank you!"
7684,127,Great time at the cabin! Very clean and comfortable.
7685,127,"Shane's place is so cozy and peaceful! It was raining our whole trip, but we lit a fire and snuggled in. Look forward to coming back sometime when we can enjoy the lake and the boats more."
7686,127,Great place had a blast on the water!
7687,127,Thank you Adam!
7688,127,Adorable little lake house. Peaceful. Great view. The house has most items you may need for your visit. Check out instructions were simple. Easy to find as long as you follow the directions given. Ducks visiting every morning was a bonus for us! We own ducks so it felt like we were at home. Enjoyed our visit.
7689,127,"A lovely, quiet and clean place. Beautiful view of the lake."
7690,127,Shane is a great host! Many of our questions/communications were responded to in a matter of minutes. The cabin is a very restful place. Right on the banks of the lake. Take a kayak ride or use the canoe. We had frequent visitors (4 ducks) that greeted us every day. The town of Roxboro has some great restaurants. Not too far from Durham/Raleigh. Very close to VIR raceway. Really loved the lake.
7691,127,If you’re looking for a secluded relaxing spot on the lake you found it. We had a nice time but wish the town had more to offer. The kayaks and canoe available were a great addition to take out on the lake.
7692,127,"Lovely lake cabin, perfect for a couple or small family. Just loved the provided watercraft and all the amenities that were provided (kitchen staples, emergency shampoo/cond, bug spray, etc. And the neighborhood ducks were great amusement to our kids. Just a little slice of lake living in a Beautiful setting."
7693,127,"We thoroughly enjoyed our time at Shane's lake cabin. The view was gorgeous and it was so nice to have access to the kayaks, canoe and waterslide. The neighbors ducks greeted us when we arrived and so goodbye when we left... the kids loved it. The perfect little getaway!

Shane was easy to communicate with and so helpful. We will definitely be coming back!"
7694,127,"Wonderful place - great swimming, secluded, great communication from host."
7695,127,Great stay.
7696,127,Third year staying at Shane's and we already cannot wait to get back! Great place and host.
7697,127,"Great host and property, the location is very dreamy! A few missing amenities compared to the listing (grill, electricity on the porch, pedal boat) but we really enjoyed our stay. Shane was very responsive and willing to help. Very relaxing!"
7698,127,Thank you for your reservation and review. It is listed no grill supplied on listing (previous guest caused damage) and in every check in instructions prior to check in. There is full electricity on the porch - apparently you had tripped a breaker and lastly the paddle boat is there and unfully functionable. Thank you for the compliments I try very hard to make every guest my number one priority
7699,127,We had a great time! The lake is gorgeous. The cabin is great. It was the relaxing vacation we were looking for. Wifi worked well. We definitely want to come back again.
7700,127,"Really enjoyed our stay! The location was great, nice and quiet."
7701,127,"We had the best time at Shane’s lake house!! Took the dogs and our kayaks for a weekend getaway. We felt truly unplugged and far away from the city. Shane was an awesome host, and we look forward to our next stay!"
7702,127,"I booked this spot for fishing and it was a pleasure getting out on the lake with all of the water crafts they have available. The location is super quiet and even more lovely than the photos depict. Shane was quick to respond and gave very clear directions. Also, it was awesome having an Alexa for any music needs! I highly recommend this location and would love to come back and explore the lake more, it's much larger than imagined! One of my dogs fell ill while we were there but we found a wonderful vet nearby. I highly recommend Woodsdale Animal Hospital if anyone has need of their services while in the area. Despite the sick doggo, we had a wonderful time and would happily return!"
7703,127,Shane was an awesome host. The house and the view were great. I would highly recommend this place.
7704,127,"Reviews for properties like this are so easy. Shane has done everything that a great Airbnb host can do to make a stay enjoyable. Hosts like Shane are a prime reason we continue to use Airbnb as our favorite destination source.

The cabin is exactly as described in the listing and therefore there were no surprises. Shane was very quick to respond to the few questions we had, which we appreciated greatly. Mayo Lake is beautiful and the view from the wrap-around deck was great. Our visit was short so we didn't have a lot of time on the lake but I did catch a few fish and lake access for launching a small boat was great.

Shane's Water Front Lake House on Mayo Lake is certainly on our list for return visits."
7705,127,Perfect little cabin nestled away in the woods with a picturesque view of the lake. A great place to disconnect and relax
7706,127,"Shane’s cabin is just as described. Our family of 5 had a great time there. There is everything you could possibly want there from sheets, blankets, towels, to dishes, laundry stuff and even fishing poles. The pond is great with lots of fishing off the dock. There is a canoe and a couple of kayaks. Lots of seating on the porch, by the fire pit, and on the dock.
My kids also enjoyed feeding the ducks!"
7707,127,"Lf you are looking for piece and quiet, this is the place. Want to relax, unwind and enjoy the surroundings, this is it. Want to fish a little and enjoy some company, l mean Fonald and Daisy duck, the Lake House offers it all. Great place with a great value."
7708,127,This is a great place to relax and enjoy the pease and quiet of the lake in a great cabin. The lake side porch is awesome and so is the view. The trails are great and we found some interesting very old structures back in the woods. I would highly recommend this cabin.
7709,127,"I booked this lake cabin for my wife and I for our six year anniversary and it was perfect. We were looking for a private cottage to spend the weekend and we got so much more. Shane’s cabin was cozy and exciting. It had all the necessities of home, plus lots of fun lake activities. It ended up being colder outside than we thought so didn’t get to play in the water like we hoped, but we will def be back for some of that. The view from the dock on the lake is amazing and we loved sipping on our coffee watching the fisherman go by. We had a fun time visiting with the pet ducks Daisy and Donald. So funny and friendly! Can’t wait for the next trip. Definitely recommend this cottage to anyone looking to get away from it all. The host also was very accommodating when I asked if we could get into the cabin a few hours earlier due to us having dogs. That really took some
stress off the trip. Thank you Shane!"
7710,127,"when we pulled into the driveway, the sunset was over the lake with a full moon. it was the best welcome for our spring break. this place was absolutely awesome. I wanted a private area where I could sit on the porch and watch my kids play, fish, splash and bond. my son even built a few forts he left behind. This place was it. Every morning prepare to be greeted by the two local ducks, Donald and Daisy. Shane provides duck food to make this a cute little experience for anyone. the cabin is clean and comfy with a TV in each room. we cooked all our meals as everything was provided to do so. This place was so quiet at times it gives you the feel that you have the whole lake. It's nothing fancy but more of a nostalgic feeling of comfort and relaxation. Perfect porch swing view. when you first hit the road don't fret, just keep driving. Drive all the way to the end, no turns and when you enter into the driveway you can breathe with ease that you just found a little corner of heaven in the trees by the lake. it was just so great guys. I want to go back. thank you shane for the core memories we made.
ps- there are neighbors. they were kind when we saw them, which was twice. they are very quiet."
7711,127,This cabin is Exactly as described in the description along with pictures. We had a relaxing time. Enjoyed the cabin and trails was cold but got to kayak and fish in the snow! Very nice quiet private place with ducks that come visit every time you walk onto deck. The host was very quick to respond to anything we needed. Loved the wood stove to keep us warm. Will be back as soon as we can and this time in the summer to enjoy the breath taking views and warm weather to go swimming and canoeing .
7712,127,Been doing Airbnb's for a while now with my job and can honestly say one of the best places I've stayed in. Great location and Shane was always right on point with anything that needed to be done. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to be near the lake!!
7713,127,We loved our stay at the cabin. It was quiet and secluded with lake access just steps away.
7714,127,"This home was perfect for a combo of peaceful and playful. It is a gem! Shane was easy to communicate with. The kitchen was fully stocked with pots, pans, utensils and even fishing poles! We really loved this home! Just a short walk down path to Mayo Lake. The lake is a photographer's delight with changing colors throughout the day. Can't wait to return."
7715,127,"The Roxboro Lake House is A wonderful, remote place that had everything we needed—including strong WiFi—and at the he same time was remote and nostalgic. We paddled, skipped rocks, and played board games. A great time."
7716,127,"The cabin was a great experience. Shane was a caring host and the cabin itself was spacious and had great features. We enjoyed the fire pit, porch, and nice TV in the main room. The host let us know beforehand that the grill was no longer an option and the paddle boat is not available. If you have a group of up 5-6, there is plenty of sleeping space and it was a relaxing, fun experience."
7717,127,Absolutely fabulous and peaceful location. We have a big wake board boat and we were able to easily get the dock on the lake even with the low water. Shane is a fabulous host and this great home is a hidden gem!
7718,127,"Clean, cozy, and comfortable lake house. Beautiful private setting with access to a dock, firepit, and fabulous wrap around porch. We had only booked a weekend, but would love to have had more time to spend just soaking up the peace and quiet."
7719,127,"This was our second trip to Shane's, and we already can't wait to book a third. The location is private and perfect, and the house is so cozy! It was very hard to leave at the end of our trip."
7720,127,"Great rustic cabin stay. Shane was super communicative. Do not expect great cell
/internet reception."
7721,127,Bring a boat or jet ski if you have one!
7722,127,Very nice quiet place. Our boys had so much fun. Will definitely visit again!
7723,127,"What a hidden gem! Such an adorable lakefront cottage that provided the quiet serenity that is so rare and treasured these days. The host exemplified wonderful hospitality, as well as clear and expedient communication. Definitely on my ""will visit again"" list."
7724,127,My family loved staying here. It was very cozy and fun to be at. We will definitely be returning!
7725,127,Love every minute of it
7726,127,We really enjoyed our stay at the lake house! The space is very nice and comfortable and the lake is beautiful and very relaxing. The town had a great food store and anything else that you would need. The kitchen was stocked with cooking appliances and the fire pit was a great place to relax at night. Would recommended highly to anyone looking to get away and relax!
7727,127,"We had a great stay at the cabin, it had a great view of the lake and we went out on the kayaks and toured the area. The fire pit by the lake was also a highlight for us. The cabin has everything you should need for a nice get-away. Shane was very responsive to our questions before and during the stay. Easy self check in process too!"
7728,127,"At the end of a dirt road, we've discovered a wooden gem house, nestled by the lake in the forest. A typical wooden house with all the amenities and comfort you need! The porch overlooking the lake is the perfect place for a drink, reading a book or just relax in the rocking chairs. We had so much fun kayaking, canoeing, fishing and walking the trails in the forrest. Shane provides everything to spend a one of a kind stay at her house. Thank you ... and see you soon !!!!!"
7729,127,Shane went above and beyond as a host. We will definitely be back!
7730,127,"This is a very cute and comfortable lake house. Shane is a great host that is very quick to respond and willing to go out of her way to make sure everything is perfect. We were there with an ice storm approaching and she was willing to do whatever we needed. When it comes to hospitality, she is top notch.

The cabin was very comfortable with a working wood stove that pumped out a ton of heat. Everything you would need is provided, from towels to a coffee maker. There is a beautiful wrap around porch that provided lots of places to sit and enjoy the beautiful water views.

I would highly recommend this place and Shane. Looking forward to a return trip in the summer!"
7731,127,"Great little house on the lake. Everything you need. Had some weather issues, but Shane went above and beyond to make our stay special. Thank you"
7732,127,This location is beautiful! Only about 50 feet from the lake where kayaks and a canoe are readily available. The entire cabin is decorated phenomenally and the amenities in house are perfect for full weekend stays. The host is quick with responses and very kind. If you want a retreat away from the world this is the place to go. I didn’t even see a single person the whole time I was there! Very private with plenty of entertaining things to do.
7733,127,"Shane is a fantastic host! I enjoyed my stay at her cabin for the month of January. Beautiful views over the lake and plenty of places to walk my dog on the property or a quick drive away.

Very easy to drive down to Durham, Raleigh, or Chapel Hill to explore for the day. Would love to return!"
7734,127,Awesome place to relax! we will come back next year for sure!
7735,127,"I had arrived late at night after having car troubles and wasn’t able to see exactly where I was. In the morning I was astounded with the view of the lake and the beauty of the property! We saw a deer swimming through the lake (something I’d never seen before), and she jumped out on the property and ran into the woods. We took many little walk into the woods and found an old foundation and 2-story fireplace. It was incredible! My dad is an expert stone mason so he was extremely excited about this find. It is only help up by an old dead tree and I wouldn’t recommend getting too close, but what a cool relic of time! We spent time by the fire pit and had a couple nights of clear skies and a stellar meteor shower. The space itself had great amenities and I was able to make birthday cupcakes for my preschooler with ease. Shane is so kind and helpful and a wonderful host. There are a few dump sites leading down to the property, but they are not on Shane’s property. That being said, it did make me a little weary of the water quality and any runoff going into the lake affecting the fish/wildlife, as well as swimming. I studied aquifers and work in the environmental field, so this was a bit heartbreaking to me. Other than that, our stay was beautiful and I hope to return when the weather warms up!"
7736,127,"My family had a wonderful, socially distant Thanksgiving at Shane’s cabin. We had perfect weather and spent our days outside kayaking, fishing, and hanging out on the dock. Everything we needed for outdoor activities were provided. The cabin was rustic but had everything we needed (linens, dishes, wifi, etc). Sitting on the porch in the mornings drinking coffee was perfect. We never ventured to town, but did check out hiking at Mayo Lake Park, which was a short drive away. Highly recommend this place if you are looking for an outdoor getaway!"
7737,127,"We spent all morning on the beautiful porch, all day exploring the huge lake, and all evening around the fire pit. Couldn't of asked for a better location!"
7738,127,This place is nestled back off the road and pretty private. The cabin is rustic but has all the comforts needed to make the stay enjoyable and relaxing without roughing it too much. The lake was calm and relaxing. We fished and kayaked and spent quality family time around the fire pit in the evenings.
7739,127,"The location of the cabin was very good, you could walk right out on the porch and enjoy the view. We had some fires next to the lake and took the canoe out for fishing too. Overall a peaceful stay and only about 15-20 minutes to town for whatever you may need. The wifi worked well for zoom meetings as well. Hopefully we'll come back in the summer too!"
7740,127,"The cabin is very clean, homey, rustic and the best thing is the view of the lake and the expansive porches. The wifi was great which was important to us. Shane was so quick with communication and very welcoming."
7741,127,"Great place to stay by the lake. We had an awesome stay with natural nature life. Yes, I will be returning again. Our host did a great job with communication. The only thing is we had spotty phone service during our stay. We had to use the house WiFi to make calls through whats app. So be prepared to be somewhat off the grid. It’s was a very peaceful get away. We highly recommend it. Wish we could have stayed longer."
7742,127,Great little house with charm. Feels like your far away without being far from town. Good neighbors too.
7743,127,"Great house right on the lake! Swimming and fun for the whole family, especially the dogs!"
7744,127,Shane was a great host! The cabin had a great deck and amazing view of the lake. We hope to come back some day.
7745,127,We had such a lovely and relaxing time here! It is so beautiful and right on the water. We ate every meal on the dock and spent almost the whole time there or on the porch. The lake was quiet and serene. It seems like the houses end here so there was little boat traffic which made using the kayak and canoes so much fun. The rustic cabin was perfect for a week away and Shane made communication so easy. We hope to be back soon!
7746,127,"Everything you need for a peaceful getaway. I have no idea about local activities because we never left the lake. The lake is wonderful. Calm and refreshing, surrounded by woods, you can barely see most of the houses in the trees. It was perfect for kayaking. And I didn't even have to bring my kayak because there was one there. One thing I loved but my son didn't - in the afternoon the dock is in shade. He wanted to bake in the sun, not me. I could sit out there all day and enjoy the breeze off the water."
7747,127,"A rustic cabin in a nice spot by the lake. Nice to have a grill and picnic tables, as well as a canoe for going out on the lake."
7748,127,Exactly what we were looking for. Beautiful view of the lake while sitting in a rocking chair on the porch. It was peaceful and quiet. You can hear the wind in the trees and the crickets at night. The stars are so bright with no light pollution. The beds were very comfortable and we had everything we needed. My husband took our 2 girls out in the canoe and they caught their first fish with the poles Shane has waiting in the cabin. It was also perfect for our Golden Retriever. He spent most of our time in the lake with the kids. We look forward to coming back.
7749,127,"This place is a great value. It’s not five star accommodations, but that shouldn’t be expected for the price – it has cute touches but it’s a cozy, rustic cabin. The location on the lake is great – fairly tucked away in a quiet cove (for the most part – one day, there were guns being shot on the other side for several hours; I don’t know how frequently that happens). There are some close by neighbors, but we didn’t have any issues (e.g., noise) with them. Shane is a good host – committed, thoughtful and responsive. For example, at one point we lost internet service; I called her and she answered during a dentist appointment. She quickly called the provider and made sure service was restored. A couple things to keep in mind: 1) The grill is charcoal, and charcoal is not provided (nor, during our visit, were some other basic grill tools present). 2) We had no phone service; apparently some visitors do and some don’t. 3) The kitchen trash can has no lid, which could create odor and insect issues over a long enough stay."
7750,128,"If you are looking for somewhere peaceful to reset, this is the right place. Judith, Henry, and Ladybug are great, friendly hosts that have a lot to share. The whole property (with its own hiking trail and cool chill spots) is gorgeous. If you’re curious about how it is to live in a tiny home, this would definitely make you fall in love with the lifestyle."
7751,128,"thanks for the great review, you 'got' the place..."
7752,128,Staying in Peaceful Valley was amazing. The location was so tranquil and I felt right at home at the Airbnb. I will definitely come back!
7753,128,thank you for the kind review.
7754,128,"My partner and I enjoyed how unique and quirky the tiny house and the land it sits on are. This place is definitely one of a kind. Our favorite part was seeing the list of films that indicated the various props within the house and what set they were from. Henry, Judith and Ladybug are genuine souls who’ve created a magical getaway for those who can appreciate nature. I highly recommend!"
7755,128,"thank you for your kind review! Glad you had a good time even though it mostly rained...come back anytime, we show you the house and all the art inside next time!"
7756,128,"One of my favorite stays I’ve ever had on airbnb. Amazing location, records, walking trails, and such a peaceful place. I hope to be back soon!"
7757,128,"glad you enjoyed the records, we added some CD's to the mix for next year...."
7758,128,"It was a pleasure meeting Judith and Ladybug. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! The home was quiet, cozy, and contained everything we needed for the weekend. We would highly recommend this stay for anyone looking to get away for a bit."
7759,128,thank you!
7760,128,"This place was way better than we even thought it would be! Henry and his wife are so incredibly nice and the location of the stay is immaculate.

We can't wait to stay again."
7761,128,"Really neat place. My husband and I stayed here a few days. Hosts were helpful and thoughtful. The trails and various artwork were fun, as well as the items inside the home. Great value for the price. One thing I’d caution, if you are a heavier person, is that the mattress doesn’t offer much support, and sinks pretty badly. Probably wouldn’t be an issue for smaller people. Otherwise place is perfect and very peaceful."
7762,128,"Well, most people actually told us that they never slept as well as here in our cabin...and you are right, it might be a matter of weight...."
7763,128,What a delightful place! So much creative energy and a delightful getaway! Everything you lay your eyes on makes you think and wonder. What a joy to stay at this cozy tiny home that Judith and Henry have created! And to walk the property and see all the art mixed in nature!
7764,128,thank you for your kind review....we really enjoyed talking with you before you left!
7765,128,"This is the second time I booked a stay at Peaceful Valley and the Shiva Station with Henry, Judith and Ladybug.
This time my husband stayed there and was just as enamored with the place as I was. We’ll be back for individual/couples getaway as much as we can. Pure magic!"
7766,128,"thanks, we are looking forward to see and talk with you again...loved your company!"
7767,128,"Like many others who have stayed here before, if you’re looking to disappear this place is it. What Henry + Judith listed is really what you’re going to get. This tiny home really allows you to focus on yourself and enjoy the surrounding nature. There’s little trails and interesting Easter eggs here and there. The hosts are super friendly and they communicate really well. I unfortunately came when it decided to rain and there was a short power outage and the hosts came out to check on everything and let me know what was going on. Also, be sure to say hi to Ladybug!"
7768,128,thank you so much kingson for the great review. you were such a trooper this weekend and got to use our 'emergency power out bucket' as the first guest to do so....you were a great guest!
7769,128,"This listing should come with a warning label…Warning: returning to society will be very difficult after visiting Peaceful Valley. The Shiva Shack hugs you with peace while providing an interesting trinket around every corner. My husband and I walked the trails on the property at least 4 times. The trails are about a 30 minute walk if you keep going, but if you choose to stop and linger at each peaceful stop along the trail, you could spend a day in the woods. Henry and Judith are truly exceptional hosts. Peaceful Valley is calling me back!"
7770,128,"This is a magical place that you have stumbled on by good luck.
If you love art, nature, quiet and adventure this is your place.
It is a wonderland! This little cabin had everything I needed to make me feel cozy and at home."
7771,128,thank you and good luck with your photography...
7772,128,One will not find an experience such as this anywhere on the planet. Unique to the Nth degree. Super accommodating hosts. Made my last days together with my Autistic adult son a time that couldn’t be more than Just Right.
7773,128,glad you and clay had such a good time together....bring him back anytime....
7774,128,"This was my second visit, and as magical as the first. Whether it was a close encounter with a frog, or open eye meditations beside the lake, or the calming presence of the moon, I felt life as a deeply meaningful experience."
7775,128,we love to provide deeply meaningful experiences...glad you had them....see you soon...
7776,128,Beautiful & eclectic stay. Judith & Henry are very conscious hosts who value their peaceful property and their guests.
7777,128,Wonderful hosts with welcoming hearts. They’ve created an oasis and are generous in sharing it. I highly recommend for a relaxing retreat.
7778,128,thank you
7779,128,Definitely a gem!! If you’re thinking about it.. do it.
7780,128,"We booked this wonderful tiny home to get away from the city life and spend some quality time together and it was everything we needed. The home is inviting and magical, the land is welcoming, and the art is beautiful. 2 nights was not enough, we are already planning on another, longer visit."
7781,128,we are glad you liked it and want to come back...you are welcome anytime...
7782,128,"I came for a peaceful retreat from a busy urban life, and was delighted with the outcome. The lake calmed my thoughts. The trails supported my mindful walking. The night silence deepened my sleep. And I got some inspiring insights about my spiritual practices when using the Om Shanti space in the forest. This airbnb provides so much more than just a cozy home."
7783,128,we are glad that you GOT our space...it is really a retreat and we hope many others will find us here for their own explorations...this is beneficial for both the guests and the hosts. we love to see you coming back anytime...namaste
7784,128,"I feel like this location embodies a lot of what I love about Airbnb. It's quirky, the hosts are friendly, and you get a truly unique stay. I loved the remoteness, the walking trails, and the thoughtful decoration of the tiny house. It is a good place for someone who enjoys a little adventure in their travel."
7785,128,thanks and all the best on your future adventures!!
7786,128,"This place has so much to offer. We never left the property! It was more than I had imagined. By far, my favorite airbnb and host ever! I am already looking at my calendar to come back!!!!!"
7787,128,well you know henry's response to that: Come back soon!! We enjoyed BOTH of you to the max!
7788,128,"I couldn't have asked for a better experience! The house was comfy and had everything I needed. The property is beautiful and I loved walking the trails, sitting next to the stream, and painting by the pond. Judith and Henry are wonderful hosts and beautiful people. I look forward to returning with friends and family!"
7789,128,we enjoyed hosting a super guest/friend! we would love to see you unfold in your artistic life - and being able to say: we knew her before she came famous (and rich)!!! we really love what you and your family are doing with your life...
7790,128,"The most PERFECT place for anyone looking to escape away into nature! The property is absolutely beautiful and the artwork located in different spots around it are amazing. If you’ve never driven through the mountains before, don’t worry as it’s pretty easy to get through. Also, make sure to keep an eye out for ladybug… aka the cutest dog ever 🥰"
7791,128,"thanks for the kind review, looking forward to hosting you again, hint, hint..."
7792,128,"As promised and so very much more. I found myself tiptoeing around to keep from disturbing nature. Rain drops, frog croaks, thunder, trickling brook splashes, a bird or three up in the branches. Who needs anything else? Judith and Henry love this Pleasant Valley and have curated their space to give visitors an escape from the mess we leave behind when turning on to Wyatt Road.

Then there’s the memorabilia from two careers building cinematic stage sets. You just have to see this for yourself. Amazing. For me, my next visit will not be marred by reasons to venture outside Pleasant Valley. I want to be nowhere but here until forced to leave."
7793,128,"That was a very nicely written review, will!! Thank you! you got the place and us....we hope to see you again sometime....and talk about the world and everything..."
7794,128,this place is the perfect getaway to unplug and unwind. the atmosphere is relaxing and calming. we recommend coming here if your feeling stressed out and need to clear your head! Henry and Judith and Ladybug are some of the kindest and coolest beings on Earth!
7795,128,we are glad you liked it!!
7796,128,"We feel a bit selfish in sharing this review. Part of us doesn't want too and the other part wants to shout it from the mountain top! Or the Valley -- a lil' inside joke! It's because it's a magical place! if you come here, leave everything on White Oak Road, the work, the worries, the stress, the lap top, the phone, well actually you will need that for Hanry & Judith's directions! But when you park, just turn it on airplane mode and escape! This is your place to unwind, explore, and listen. Please read the guest book - we enjoyed reading to each other a few pages each morning! If you are lucky enough for rain, stand in it, share stories and remember, the rain cleanses the soul! At night, open the windows and listen to the sweet music! This is a great place to find comfort in and refuge from the outside world. Enjoy it!"
7797,128,"thanks for this very kind review, we know you got this place and we are glad that you had such a good time. maybe we can reconnect again in the future! As they say, come as a guest, leave as a friend - we sure felt like that!! By the way, we got an apology from the neighbor per email..."
7798,128,"This place is AMAZING. Everything was as expected and more. The house is probably the most creatively curated place I have ever been in, with a theme complete from objects from the movie sets. The bed is super comfortable, and the selection of vinyls and tapes gave me so much joy to play around with. Just being in this space put gave me so much relief from anxiety and my troubles. You truly won't find a problem at all. The hosts were not only super responsive to all the requests I had, and did their best to accommodate me in any way they could, but they proved to be wonderful people who gave me space to roam but also provided wonderful conversations I'll remember for a very long time. And the property they have is GORGEOUS. You could spend weeks here and not get bored, with trails filled with so much art and attention to detail on the property itself. Around the property there are also trails you can spend your time on, and driving out of the immediate area you have many trails on the Blue Ridge. They deserve all of the praise I and the previous guests have given them. They even have a guest book where you could read how this place has affected the lives of those who have stayed here. I will certainly be back. Thank you dearly Henry, Judith, and Ladybug!"
7799,128,"wow what a review!! Mark really GOT this place in all aspects and he got both of us too, what a rare find of a person...we hope we will see him a lot more times here in the valley - as a friend not a guest!"
7800,128,Henry and Judith are two very good hosts. They were accommodating and kind.
7801,128,"Henry and Judith have a wonderful and quiet place, excellent to escape the business of daily life. The place is very much value for money and I hope more people get to enjoy this."
7802,128,"If you truly want to connect with nature, art, and sustainable living - Henry’s&Jodi’s place is a perfect place to do so! I restored my energy and connected with my daughter there, and had a magical experience overall. My daughter made friends with all the adorable ladybugs on the property, enjoyed herself jumping on the trampoline in the woods (whaaat?!), and walking those lovely trails that are also a part of the property, and seeing all the incredible art that is created by both Jodi&Henry spread everywhere. We loved this place so much, and we are definitely coming back! Connecting with the hosts is truly inspiring, and you will learn a lot. Definitely recommend staying at their lovely peaceful valley and enjoy yourself!"
7803,128,"thank you soooo much for being the perfect guests, we look forward to seeing you again in the summer maybe and we'll talk A LOT MORE!!!"
7804,128,This place is a perfect mountain escape. My husband and I enjoyed every moment of our stay. The location is perfect to explore the local beauty or branch out to surrounding areas. The house is immaculate and the compost toilet is simple to use and was no problem for us. The bed was so comfortable and was a great place to rest to get rejuvenated for your adventures the next day. The cabin held heat wonderfully for our 20 degree nights. The vibe is welcoming and homey. You won’t regret venturing out to this gem. Happy travels!
7805,128,"thanks you so much for the detailed review! and you left the place immaculate, what a treat for me!! thanks"
7806,128,"Have you ever stayed at an Air B&B that has a guest book filled with comments from travelers about how their experience transformed and inspired them - or showed them something about the way they'd like to live - or was the perfect place to create art/music/etc - or offered exactly the rest and respite that is so desperately needed in these challenging times?

Me neither, until my stay in Millers Creek. And when it came time to write my own guest book entry, I couldn't help but use the word ""magical"" to describe both the physical environment as well as the hosts.

If you're considering staying here, be sure to check the listing in full because there are some details about the location and check-in that you'll want to be sure to read before planning or embarking on your trip.

Also, if you go, please know that this space is a refuge that should be treated with the utmost respect. The woods on/surrounding the property are otherworldly and being stewarded so incredibly by Judith and Henry. It's a blessing that they've opened up their land to folks - and at such an amazing price - so if you're lucky enough to find yourself at this tiny home, I predict you will find yourself returning home filled with gratitude afterward, just as I did!"
7807,128,"You just won the best review of the year award...it will be handed over in March, hint hint....well we think you 'got' our place and what we are about. looking forward to seeing you in the spring. by the way, you were a pretty amazing guest too...."
7808,128,The tiny house is just as advertised. Very quiet and peaceful. Judith and Henry were very helpful and extremely nice.
7809,128,thank you and best of luck finding that special place....
7810,128,"This place is a great stay at a great value. If you are looking for a place to be off the grid and enjoy nature, this place is perfect. It was easy to find between the directions given by Henry and Judith and Apple Maps also gave us completely accurate directions as well. They have plenty of well marked trails through their property and it's beautiful to explore. The double bed was a little bit of a tight squeeze for two adults, but it was honestly worth it to be in the mountains like that. Extra bonus was their sweet dog Ladybug who came to say hi often!"
7811,128,"sorry to hear about the double bed being to tight, it's the first comment of that kind we ever got in 4 years and hundreds of guests sleeping here. Normally we hear that everybody sleeps like a baby and the bed is nice and cozy...It is a tiny house after all and a king size would not fit in here....Thanks for inviting ladybug into the tiny house to let her say hello!"
7812,128,"This was such a unique stay!
We are from Ohio so it was a 8hr33m+ drive. With when we were leaving to come out there, it was not check in time. But this host was able to accommodate me checking in at 10am!

Upon arrival, the host had suffered a loss the night before. So they were not too involved in our stay & they expressed their apologies, however we prefer a quiet stay! So it worked out perfectly!

For those wanting to come visit, I highly recommend. If you want souvenirs or any city life I recommend going to Boone, NC which is a 1hr away but it takes 25 minutes to even get off the mountain so it doesn’t feel like an hour!


Thanks for the great stay!"
7813,128,thanks for the kind review...
7814,128,"It’s a great spot for anyone wanting a little something different, away from noise and light pollution. Comfy bed and unique concept."
7815,128,thank you...esp. about the comfy bed....
7816,128,it was amazing
7817,128,thank you
7818,128,"Delightfully creative, sustainable and peaceful place and stay. I really loved it here. Henry and Judith have created a unique and special nook in the mountains and share it with us. Description is on point. If you like creativity, functional art, informal and relaxing spaces this is for you. I valued my time interacting with the hosts as much as they stay itself. Want to Return. You can fill a whole week just on the property but there’s a lot of nature related things to see and do close by as well."
7819,128,thanks for the great review and we love to stay connected and read your blog and follow your future travel series with your trusted sidekick....great that we finally met!!!
7820,128,"This was truly a one of a kind experience. The scenery around the home was beautiful; tucked away in the woods with a gorgeous view of the pond. The home was well stocked with pots and pans, books and tons of film memorabilia and everything was very clean and accessible. Our only mistake we felt we made was booking our stay for such a short time– we are so looking forward to coming back and spending some more time in the area. Thanks for having us!!"
7821,128,thanks for the great review!
7822,128,Very memorable experience! check it out
7823,128,good luck with nora...
7824,128,"My favorite place! My daughter and I visit every year. If you're a lover of nature and art, this place is 100% for you."
7825,128,you know we love you both....
7826,128,"What a gem!!!

Affordable and adorable <3
Judith & Henry have put so much love & time into this property!
They are not only very friendly but organized and helpful.

Amazing features: From the many artistic specialities along their trail, the large pond, pleasant creek, creative & funky tiny home, large selection of vinyl, great shower pressure… I’m baffled how sweet this spot is on the map!

I really needed a get away in nature and their place delivered; They made me feel right at home :)

I will Definitely be back! XOXOXO <3"
7827,128,can't wait to have you back...thanks for the great review
7828,128,"Super cool house to stay in. The hosts were super nice, they gave us a brief but very informative orientation. Walking the trails were a big highlight of the trip. Definitely looking forward to staying here again."
7829,128,great that you 'got' our place...you are always welcome back!
7830,128,"Wonderful cozy little home, beautiful property all around. Hosts are very polite, hope to return someday!"
7831,128,thanks for being such easy guests and leaving the cabin super clean was extra cool!!
7832,128,"OMG.. This was such a bless trip for me, everything was perfect ... Love the house, the place , the nature that surround it, the calm, the serenity was what my soul need it.
Judith and Henry have an amazing place, the garden with the chakras it was my favorite spot to meditate in the mornings.
I will definitely come back soon ! :) Gracias, Gracias, Gracias"
7833,128,"we also felt really connected to you and we do hope that you can come back soon and stay for the whole time... Thanks again for the rose quartz, the space will definitely benefit from it!! Gracias!"
7834,128,"Thanks so much for the hospitality! Henry and Judith are welcoming and friendly hosts but also give you privacy. Cabin is nestled in the woods and gives treehouse vibes. Great hot water and shower pressure, compost toilet was no stress. Very unique space, eclectic record collection. Surrounding land is beautiful and very peaceful. Go find the trampoline in the forest! So much fun."
7835,128,thanks for the detailed review! Good luck for your future life plans...
7836,128,Great peaceful location to wander in the woods & relax. My theater daughter really enjoyed herself exploring the movie artifacts.
7837,128,thank you
7838,128,"Great stay: beautiful space, awesome people, great location! 🌻"
7839,128,"thanks, looking forward to some talks around the fire pit...."
7840,128,"The Tiny House is the perfect spot for anyone looking for a peaceful, restful experience in nature"
7841,128,thank you and happy hiking....
7842,129,Great spot
7843,129,This was out second stay here and just as amazingas the first time. close to everything we needed.
7844,129,"Arrived, this is our second stay, as expected clean, secure, conveniently located . We will certainly rebook when in the area."
7845,129,The cottage was clean and super cozy. We really enjoyed our stay!
7846,129,"We loved our stay at Colby and Hilary’s place. The pictures of the place were just as expected, we loved the hot tub and the space in general. It was clean and cozy, so many great features-snacks for kids, hot tub, fire pit, clean and comfy bedrooms/beds etc. We spent Sunday at South Mountain State hiking with friends. The day we left, we relaxed in the morning and left at our own pace. Thank you to Colby and Hilary!"
7847,129,"Perfect little getaway home!! Had everything you would need. My husband and I can honestly say this was the best rental we have stayed at.. Thank you Colby and Hillary for sharing your farmhouse 💞

Elisa & Lance"
7848,129,This was a beautiful stop for my and my wife's honeymoon. Very peaceful and Morgantown is so cute. It's a wonderful place to rest.
7849,129,"Highly recommend. Home was exactly as described, and hosts were proactive with instructions and highly responsive to all inquiries."
7850,129,Our stay was ao nice! The hot tub was perfect and made for a great way to relax at the wnd of the day. The fire pit had plenty of availabe wood and seating was ao comfortable. We had a great trip.
7851,129,"Colby and Hilary have clearly traveled before!!!! And by doing so they have created the most welcoming space for us!!!. They provided so many necessities as well as thoughtful extras. The house was perfect and so clean and spacious, we couldn't have been happier."
7852,129,Second time we stayed here and again it was perfect! Felt right at home.
7853,129,"My family and I had a wedding and stayed the weekend. We had a wonderful time. Communication with Colby & Hilary was amazing, detailed, and helpful. The house was just the best! It was decorated beautifully and they thought of everything someone would need. We didn’t have time to use the hot tub or fire pit area but it was so beautiful and wish we had more time to have used it. The beds were very comfortable and everything was very cozy. My family and I really enjoyed our stay and we highly recommend this home with Colby & Hilary. Thank you so much for all of your help and just a wonderful stay everything was truly amazing!"
7854,129,"This was a great stay! Nice and quiet area, the cottage was super cute and clean, and everything was well thought through."
7855,129,"We had a great stay. The location was convenient with good privacy. The cottage was well-equipped. Just a comfortable, enjoyable place to stay."
7856,129,"THE BEST AIRBNB EVER!!! This place was truly a home away from home. I am very picky about cleanliness, and I must say that their cottage was immaculate! The backyard was cozy with the fire pit and hanging lights, and very private with the fencing. The beds slept like a dream! We could have walked to The “Apple Orchard and Cider Mill” which was less than a mile down the road. You have to try the apple cider slushy! The Food Lion was a short 5 minutes down the road and was open late if you needed something last minute. We drove 1-2 hours to Charlotte, Greenville, and Asheville where we spent a day in each city. There is indoor skydiving at “IFLY” in Charlotte, and my 10 and 12 year old both can’t quit talking about how fun the experience was. The best restaurant we ate at was at “Lewis Barbecue” in Greenville. The brisket melts in your mouth like butter. I can’t say enough about this cottage and the memories we made on our trip. You won’t have a clue what you are missing if you don’t stay here and experience it all for yourself!"

7860,129,"Everything was just perfect. Quite little cottage fairly well located. You can tell that the owners care about their property, and the people coming to stay there by providing everything needed from bath supplies, kitchen supplies to laundry stuff, but most importantly a sparkling and cozy place for y’all to stay."
7861,129,"Colby & Hilary's place is one of of the best Airbnb's that we've stayed at (and we've been to quite a few!). The place was very clean, the couch & bed are very comfy, which made relaxing and sleeping very nice! The bathroom is nice and big with a nice shower. The hot tub is a bonus and they supply the wood for the fire pit so guests don't have to search the area for wood or bring their own. The back yard is fenced in for privacy while relaxing in the hot tub or by the fire. Wonderful place to stay while visiting our grandchildren who live in Drexel! Highly recommended and we'll be staying here again! Anne & Tony K. Kreamer, PA"

7864,129,"Wonderful location and value. The place was so clean and well kept with so many homey touches: first aid kit in the bathroom, warm and welcoming neighbors, coffee pot with pods for coffee, and a few more in the house. Also, it was just very comfortable and roomy. Loved the backyard with the firepit, lights, heater, and jacuzzi. It was too hot for us to use the fire pit, but it would have been fun. Colby and Hilary were so helpful with fun things to do in the area! Would stay at again!"

We forgot our soap, there is was readily available in the bathroom cabinet. The outside was beautiful and again very quiet and private. We will definitely return to this cottage."
7875,129,"What a great place to stay. We spent three weeks there and it was a home from home. The Cottage has all the amenities you need and the hot tub is great after a day hiking. Colby and Hilary's communication was excellent and we even had an extra clean of the property due to our long stay.
This was our first experience of Airbnb and we will definitely be back."

It was so clean. The bed was actually comfortable. The bathroom and kitchen were so spacious. We already have talked about coming back with friends.

The town was cute, too. Nothing was too far, and the hiking trails nearby were incredible, as well as Lake James. It was an awesome trip."

7888,129,"This cozy home is cute, clean, convenient, and comfortable. The owners have thought of everything a guest might need. There are great outdoor amenities also. This home provided a much better value and vacation experience than a cramped hotel stay."
7889,129,"Perfect little cottage! My husband and I along with our 1 year old stayed here and it was so relaxing. Very neat and clean. I have no complaints! We loved using the fire pit and heater outside, all the amenities in the bathroom and kitchen were great, and we really enjoyed the location as it felt like we were in the woods but also not a far drive from the city. We will definitely be back!"
7890,129,"Colby and Hilary made an extremely special time for our family even sweeter because of how thoughtful, intentional, well-prepared and tasteful their space was.

7897,129,"Our family absolutely loved this stay !! The house is gorgeous, the linens and towels were so soft. VERY CLEAN and the hot tub was very relaxing. Fire pit is perfect and we didn’t have to hunt for wood. Colby and Hilary respond within minutes!

Also this stay is just one hour from sugar mountain and the drive is lovely with scenic views. 10/10 would stay again"
7898,129,"The house was clean and relaxing 😌 its also very centralized to groceries stores, and outdoor activities for those looking to hike!"
7899,129,"The Cottage was absolutely amazing! The fire pit and hot tub were so nice, and they had so many little touches that just made the stay awesome! They had a variety of spare chargers, and had a nice welcome basket of snacks. They place is decorated so cute! It’s also really close to Morganton for any shopping needs. We took a trip up to Linville Falls and Cavern which was only less than an hour drive. We definitely recommend staying here for a quiet and peaceful trip! Oh and for those that may still have to work a few days on vacation, the internet connection was good as I had to work a couple days of our trip and I was able to connect with no issues."
7900,129,This place was an absolutely wonderful place to stay at!
7901,129,"This cottage is adorable. Highly recommend a stay there. The directions were clear, getting in was easy, and it was very clean.
The location is near some nice hiking trails and the hot tub was a great way to unwind. The area had very poor cell phone service, but the WiFi was great."

7905,129,"We had a great stay at the Cottage at Pine Ridge. The cottage is comfortable, well appointed, and spotless clean.

Highly recommended."
7906,129,"We enjoyed our weekend away here! The cottage was very comfortable and thoughtfully furnished. We enjoyed the outside area and fire pit, and appreciated that it was so well-stocked with firewood. Great location for exploring downtown Morganton and South Mountains State Park."

7912,129,Beautiful house and great location!
7913,129,This cottage is beyond wonderful! We were here for a wedding in Morganton and it was so close to downtown and the venu in the mountains. Everything is very modern and clean and just as shown in the pictures. The hosts were very accommodating and helpful and we would absolutely stay at this Air BnB in the future.
7914,129,Colby and Hilary's home is one of the cleanest / coziest Airbnbs I have ever visited. There seriously wasn't a speck of dust and you can tell so much thought was put into the decor and landscaping. We traveled with our infant and two year old and our oldest enjoyed exploring the backyard. They also provided waters and snacks which was a thoughtful touch!
7915,129,Absolutely loved this place!! It felt like home away home ☺️
7916,129,"A wonderful home, full of charm, very clean and well decorated. The set up with the back yard lighting and hottub really make you feel like you are on vacation. It is a great location to enjoy NC and easy access to groceries and gas.
Colby and Hilary are very accomodating, and give extra perks which makes you feel special and they care about their home and guest.
I have stayed at several places, this is my top 2. Don't miss it if you want some quiet time with your other or want to be in a good location for NC activities."
7917,129,Colby And Hilary's cottage was perfect for our vacation we took. They sent clear directions on where the location was and how to enter before heading there. It's a beautiful cottage outside of the main city with great amenities and friendly neighbors. We spent a lot of time hiking and traveling to more major cities surrounding Morganton. There's many places within an hour to an hour and a half to explore. The family owned restaurants nearby have some amazing food! Definitely was a great stay and highly recommended.
7918,129,Super adorable place! Great location and extremely clean and beautifully decorated. Highly recommend!
7919,129,"Very cute little home. Colby and Hilary did excellent job on this little home. Very clean, nicely decorated. The bed is super soft!"
7920,129,"This place was excellent! We stayed for a week and everything was perfect. It was really clean, everything provided was great (I especially loved the smell of the body wash), and the location was amazing! The beds and the blankets smelled fresh and clean. The towels are new and super fluffy! We got to see fireflies for the first time ever in the backyard, and the crickets at night were relaxing. The house is in excellent condition! I loved all of the fixtures and the style of the house. I REALLY loved the shower! I came back home and instantly wished I had that shower at home. Morganton is a cozy town about four miles from this Airbnb and provides everything you could need. Careful with the winding road going out to the Airbnb location, dont trust the speed limit sign! Be cautious taking those corners. Five stars across the board, this Airbnb experience was amazing!"
7921,129,"Very clean very updated wonderful stay the way out was well thought out and had a personal touch 100% new and updated inside and out nice little creature comforts like K cup coffee’s real plates and silverware comfortable women’s an ample toiletries

If you’re looking for a quiet cozy and comfortable don’t hesitate I definitely will be booking this home again in the near future"
7922,129,"Beautiful place very clean and comfortable
Highly recommend this stay!"
7923,129,Our stay was absolutely wonderful! The house was so charming inside and out and incredibly clean! The rooms were cozy and bedding/couch were extremely comfortable! We only wish we had enough time to visit the local orchard to go apple picking! Do not hesitate with this listing!! 10/10!
7924,129,"Quiet setting but close enough to town. Easy access. Very clean, comfortable, amenities like a hotel and hosts were great!"
7925,129,Don’t pass up on your chance to stay here. I live out of air bnb for work and this is one of the nicer homes I’ve stayed in by far.
7926,129,"Loved the this house! So, cozy and inviting!"
7927,129,This little cottage was amazing! It was very clean and the backyard was a great place to relax in the evenings! The renovations are great with a farmhouse type theme! I highly recommend this place!
7928,129,So cute. Great amenities! We would definitely stay again.
7929,129,"This is a beautiful, cozy cottage that is very relaxing and comfortable to stay in. The outside is the same with beautiful, private back yard. This a great place to go and get away for a few days."
7930,129,"I LOVED Colby and Hilary’s place! I’ve stayed at many Airbnbs over the years and this one is at the top of my list. Beautifully decorated, clean as a whistle, sweet touches like snacks and water, and excellent communication.

Home was very easy to find and close to Morganton. We didn’t have time to relax in the backyard, but it looked lovely and private. Highly recommend and would love to visit again in the future."
7931,130,"a wonderful experience! beautiful location, private, and felt right at home in the cabin. Zach was super helpful, and friendly, and did everything he could to make my stay as enjoyable as possible! I will definitely be coming back with my dog next time!"
7932,130,What a wonderful and peaceful place!! Very clean and quite. Just as described. I really enjoyed my stay and I am planning on visiting again in the future.
7933,130,👌👌
7934,130,I stayed with my dog at this cabin for a few days to get away from the craziness of life. We both absolutely loved it (especially my dog) and had a great time. Zach made sure everything was ready to go and answered any questions I had! A great place with great hosts.
7935,130,Such a nice little getaway! Great location if you’re planning on going to Hanging Rock State Park!
7936,130,Great place to sit and relax around. Definitely would recommend this to anyone who asks!
7937,130,Loved staying here! It was so peaceful and cute and felt very safe staying here as a solo female traveler. Zach was very quick to respond to any questions I had and the place was easy to find.
7938,130,"Beautiful stay
Was toasty the entire time and host was more than happy to help with any issues.
Would love to stay here again"
7939,130,"That's my second stay here, I would be happy to visit again :)"
7940,130,"We found this place for a last minute visit to the mountains and we weren’t disappointed! The cabin is in a gorgeous setting, so peaceful and hidden away. We loved the small welcoming touches, everything was spotless and Zach was super helpful with coming out to check on us and give us some more tips on the cabin. We took up some of the recommendations from the guidebook on the airbnb page too (and by Zach in person) and loved them all. The area is just amazing and we will definitely be back in the future!"
7941,130,"The place was cozy and peaceful! Zachery has provided everything we needed to start the campfire and grille, we had an awsome time spending the night at the cabin after a long day!"
7942,130,This was the best place to stay! Super close to hanging rock!! Super private and cozy. The decorations were amazing. Showering outside was so great especially with such hot water. I would definitely come here again. Can’t thank the host enough for such a great stay!
7943,130,Best cabin in the woods
7944,130,"This place is great, very quit and cozy."
7945,130,"Perfect cabin when you’re trying to have a slow, relaxing time away from chaos and work. Loved the outdoor shower! Also has everything you need!"
7946,130,Zachary’s cabin was absolutely perfect!! We went to get food and the Berry Patch down the road. We loved the outdoor shower and even the outhouse is adorable haha We’ve already booked two more stays and we can’t wait to go back!!
7947,130,Exactly as described and was truly a hidden gem. Zachery was an amazing host too. He met us when we arrived and showed us around. We found the cabin equipped with all the necessities plus some nice touches like the S'mores and the candles. Perfect destination for a relaxed laid back getaway. Would definitely return if we got a chance.
7948,130,A hidden little gem! Exactly how it’s described in the listing. Zachary was great and i would recommend this place to anyone! Really enjoyed our stay!
7949,130,Very clean play enjoyed the outdoor shower new experience. Smors on the fire was nice defiantly recommended.
7950,130,"If you’re looking for a place to get away from the craziness of life and just be in nature, this place is for you. My fiancé and I enjoyed the simplistic nature of this cabin, from the outdoor shower, to the outhouse style bathroom, all while still being able to sleep comfortably and charge our phones. We had a fire, roasted hotdogs, drank a cold one, and enjoyed the tranquility and scenery of this place."
7951,130,"Booked this cabin for a weekend with my two sons and we all absolutely loved it. This is a true off-grid cabin, but doesn’t sacrifice comfort or cleanliness. Outhouse is clean and actually pretty ingenious, as is the shower. There is a charcoal picnic grill outside by the fire pit. Lots of porch space. We sat out under the stars and watched the fireflies dance across the big field in front. We opted for the generator to take the edge off (for A/C), but the temperature ended up being really nice on its own. Noticed there was a propane heater for the cold months, which would really be fun. Sunrise was beautiful right out front. Great find - definitely staying here again!"
7952,131,"This place was perfect for our getaway and is exactly what you see in the pictures. It was very clean and we really enjoyed the hot tub. Jonathan is a great host and very responsive, we would definitely rent again."
7953,131,Enjoyable place
7954,131,The place was amazing! We enjoyed the beautiful views. Watching the sunrise from there was awesome. The place was exactly what we imagined. Will definitely recommend to others and would definitely book again!
7955,131,The hot with a beautiful view made for an amazing getaway.
7956,131,"Great home in a great location! We enjoyed the hot tub and views. Great location- close to Emerald Isle beaches, kayaks nearby, lots of great restaurants too! Very clean. Jonathan was extremely helpful and replied quickly when we had questions. 5 stars- great place to stay. Thank you!!"
7957,131,"Wonderful and beautiful view!
The place is filled with amenities and stay was super comfortable. We enjoyed it a lot!
Owner is very helpful and responsive."
7958,131,Enjoyed the place. It was just like the pictures . Very relaxing. Will definitely book again in the future.
7959,131,Everything was exactly as described and we had a great stay!
7960,131,The location was absolutely beautiful. We had an amazing night!
7961,131,Very nice with beautiful view. Highway noise was sometimes a little distracting but we didn’t know the area so didn’t realize it was busy. We saw many birds and beautiful sunrises off the porch and deck area.
7962,131,Spending the evening and sunrise in a clean hot tub overlooking a Bay Area was so amazing. The house was beautiful and I especially liked being able to see the waters through the huge windows at the foot of the bed. An awesome sound system in the house for great beachy vibes. Definitely will be back each year!! Thanks again ✅
7963,131,Amazing moon views.
7964,131,Great place very clean and nice. View from the porch and bedroom were amazing
7965,131,"Cute house with great views. Great for a weekend getaway, nice hot tub. We enjoyed our stay. Jonathan is very responsive and helpful."
7966,131,Nice place with a great view! Very convenient with our 1 year old as there was a pack-n-play and some kids toys available.
7967,131,"Everything was as advertised and host was very professional, flexible and helpful. Looking forward to visiting again!"
7968,131,We arrived with music playing which was very fitting. The hot tub was so enjoyable to us. The coffee bar was a big plus for us in which we utilized all throughout the day. Perfect location. Restaurants are not too far away on either side. Can’t wait to book again soon
7969,131,Great getaway 👌
7970,131,"The hot tub and water views were amazing. We also took advantage of the kayak and took a quick trip around the marsh area. Definitely a memorable experience. I think that Jonathan had done an amazing job of turning the back part of this property into a peaceful vacation oasis. However, this home is off a busy 4 lane road which did take away from the overall peacefulness for us. We live in the county on 6 acres and we’re at times very distracted by the road. I suggest brining noise canceling ear phones if you are easily distracted by noise. Other than the busy road, this house was amazing and Jonathan is an exceptional host! Highly recommend this vacation home!"
7971,131,"This was my 1st airbnb experience and I was not disappointed! Jonathan was a perfect host. My niece and I enjoyed our stay and the property was perfect for the dogs and us. The hot tub on the back deck overlooking the marsh was so relaxing and the busy highway provided an almost constant hum that I found very soothing. My niece, however, is a very light sleeper and wasn't as happy with the 'white noise' ;-) I would not hesitate to book with Jonathan again!"
7972,131,"Beautiful home! House was super clean, view was amazing and everything was perfect. We will definitely be back! Thank you again for sharing your beautiful home with us :)"
7973,131,Wonderful place to stay. The description was spot on. Great place for getaway. Great food nearby. Perfect place for us to go back and forth for MCT graduation.
7974,131,"Jonathan's location was just what we needed. The views and spaces to enjoy, from the dining table, to the hot tub, to the bedroom windows, were incredible & serene. The experience has seriously made us fall in love with the marsh, I found myself enjoying it more than being close to the beach. Short drive from Swansboro, such a cute town to walk around in & incredible restaurants. Then just another short drive to the beach. When we first pulled in, we were a little thrown by how close it was to the road & being able to hear the cars drive by, but do not let that stop you! When you're in the back side of the house, you don't notice any of it at all & feels like it's far away from everything. Great tv/internet setup, too. And great communication from host, this place is a gem & very well taken care of. We look forward to coming back!"
7975,131,"Came to the coast with my dog as a new North Carolinian and to enjoy a hot tub I moved away from Up North. The house was as described, well equipped and comfortable. I really liked the surround sound on the big TV as there are 3 in the house for larger groups. With it being off season with not much to do as well as being a solo guest, the hot tub was the main draw for me. It was basic. For most people that won't matter as they will enjoy the area attractions and each other, along with all the other amenities the house provides. Nice stay, Thanks Jonathan."
7976,131,"Beautiful view, comfortable home, and very responsive host! Very close to the beach and plenty of food options around. Would definitely recommend!"
7977,131,Super great home!! Loved the hot tub and view!
7978,131,What a fantastic little place me and my partner were there for our first anniversary! Look forward to making another stay at some point in the future!
7979,131,"Double water therapy! I didn’t do much besides soak in the hot tub while staring at the water view. The town nearby; Swansboro, is a bird sanctuary with a quaint downtown. It’s a quick drive to Emerald Isle if you want some time at the beach.

This was the cleanest Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in which was especially nice given that it’s pet friendly. The space itself was cute and the view can’t be beat. I could absolutely see myself coming back and am thrilled I chose this location for my vacation this year."
7980,131,"Great spot! Hot tub is excellent, nice quiet location. Highly recommend."
7981,131,Very cozy and well decorated place. We loved all the extra touches. We will definitely be back!
7982,131,"Beautiful place! Absolutely great spot to unwind. We loved the proximity to shops and places to eat, as well as the gorgeous views. Can't recommend enough!"
7983,131,Great view of the water!
7984,131,"The home was beautiful and welcoming. The view and the sunrise over the lake was amazing. Everything was clean, stocked and the homeowners communicated every step of the way and made themselves available even into the evening to answer questions. Definitely worth it and will return and recommend.!"
7985,131,"This place was fantastic, clean and as described. We had everything we needed and wanted at the house. The view was amazing and the hot tub made the stay during the cold weather very worth it. As other reviews have stated, it’s right off the road. The road noise was a lot for us especially considering we work night shift and preferred sleeping in. That’s the only thing we really didn’t like - but everything else made the stay worth it and more."
7986,131,"It is a place to help release stress, I fell in love with the beauty of it. Having my morning coffee was so relaxing , not even the rain interfer with it."
7987,131,"This was our second time staying at Jonathan’s listing. The place always has everything you need. Both, in bathrooms and kitchen very well stocked. The jacuzzi was a huge plus, very relaxing esp during the cold season. This place is great for a getaway of relaxation and connection to nature. We really enjoy the scenic sunrise and sunsets from their place! Jonathan is also extremely responsive and will go out of his way to make sure their guests are comfortable. Thanks for hosting such great place!"
7988,131,This stay was incredible and romantic 10/10
7989,131,"Fantastic view, wonderful little town with lots to do. Hot tub was amazing and the house is decorated so beautifully."
7990,131,"Excellent host, the place looked just like on pictures we saw on Airbnb. Highly recommend! We will be back!"
7991,131,"Our stay was great! The issues we had were our own (a 2 year old who wanted to walk around with the coasters or open cabinets but hey, kids right? lol) The fenced area was perfect for our Doggo and the view is spectacular. Watching the sunrise in the hottub is second to none. The house across the marsh had a dozen white xmas trees out and it was a perfect festive touch. WELL STOCKED and had every amenity. Couldn't have been better. Wish we could have stayed longer!"
7992,131,great location for a girls relaxing weekend. bridal shower party and wedding planning.
7993,131,Jonathan was very responsive to any concerns we had.
7994,131,I had my honeymoon and it was absolutely perfect!!! The home was extremely clean and well kept! I would definitely recommend this home to anyone!
7995,131,"The house and views are beautiful. You won’t want to leave the hot tub. Jonathan was extremely responsive to the few questions we had during our stay. Also, Boro was terrific - we ate there twice."
7996,131,"Place was clean and wonderful, view and amenities were second to none. Close to beach and other fun attractions around town. Communication with host was excellent, looking forward to staying again!"
7997,131,Great view and a clean little house to stay in. The house is right off of highway 24 and the traffic can be a little loud at time. Overall it was a great stay at a house in a good location to food and entertainment.
7998,131,Gorgeous location just what we were looking for to spend some relaxation time. Jonathan was a great host with clear communication. Beautiful decor with thoughtful and well appointed guest amenities.
7999,131,Wonderful home in a perfect location! Highly recommend staying here. The house was so clean and perfect for a small family! We will definitely come back again.
8000,131,Very kind and willing to help the view from the bed room window in beautiful
8001,131,Great place and location!!
8002,131,"Came to this home for a birthday getaway. My boyfriend and I could not have enjoyed the location more, and loved being able to kayak and fish right off the backyard! The house is perfectly located close to both Swansboro and Emerald Isle. We highly recommend taking the ferry nearby to Hammock’s Beach State Park!"
8003,131,"great place to stay with a beautiful view of the sunrise, nice hot tub, and located in the middle of plenty of places to eat and shop"
8004,131,We had a great time staying at Johnathan's place right on the water. We used the hot tub both nights which was lovely. The house worked out just fine for us but it is right next to a busy street and the car noise can be annoying at times. Very pretty sunrises and lots of bird wildlife.
8005,131,Great stay! Our 2 toddlers and 2 dogs joined us and we can’t find anything negative to say! The location was amazing and we really enjoyed our stay!
8006,131,Highly recommend this house. The hosts are very accommodating and did everything they could to make our stay nice. The view was very nice and we even saw a stingray in the water!
8007,131,"We really enjoyed our stay! The property had such thoughtful features and everything we needed. The coffee bar was impressive, as was the entertainment options and surround sound. Jon was a great host, super communicative and responsive the one time we reached out. Despite the proximity to the main road, the sound of traffic wasn’t too bad. The only recommendation I’d make is blackout curtains for the bedroom. The light off the main road is pretty bright and. Thanks for a great stay!"
8008,131,"Out of all my stays at an Airbnb, hands down, this was my favorite!
Beautiful and comfy home with the luxury of fishing right in the backyard!
Jonathan was courteous enough to shoot me a call to warn me of how the tides would look a bit concerning due to the hurricane that passed by. Such a pleasant person to speak to!
I am looking forward to staying here again!!!"
8009,131,"Thank you for staying in our home, you are welcome back anytime. Our goal is truly to give folks a little taste of the peace and quiet of Swansboro, NC. I am glad you found that on your trip. Safe travels my friend and hope to meet you the next time you're down this way."
8010,131,Amazing!
8011,131,Amazing place!! I stayed at both of their properties in Cedar Point. I can’t say enough about their properties and hosts!! Cutest decorated cottage with everything you need for an amazing stay! Didn’t use the hot tub but it was there and functional. Beds were amazingly comfortable. The place was spotless and I would most definitely stay again!!
8012,131,The view is absolutely amazing from this place!! And it’s such a cozy place for multiple people or even 2 people. Would definitely recommend it!
8013,131,if perfect was a place😊

8015,131,Excellent host. Fantastic communication and extremely accommodating. Terrific spot for fishing.
8016,131,Beautiful view and great location! We had a wonderful couple days
8017,131,"Exactly what my mom and I were looking for on our gals trip. We spent a ton of time kayaking and enjoying the hot tub. Also really appreciated how well stocked the house was in terms of daily needs (shower stuff, cooking utensils, cleaning supplies, etc). Would love to come back again!"
8018,131,"Beautiful view. So much fun fishing right from the backyard. The road in front is very busy and noisy but if that doesn't bother you, this is an amazing location. Even has a fence around the backyard that helps make this house more dog friendly. We loved it, overall."
8019,131,"This cute cottage is right on the inland waterway and is very cozy and welcoming! It’s not too far from the actual beach, just a short car ride, and very close to restaurants and shops. The hot tub was so much fun, and while we didn’t have time to try out the kayak I just know it would have been a blast to scoot right out on the smooth water. Thanks Johnathan!"
8020,131,great getaway and enjoyed kayaking!
8021,131,Thank you so much! Our vacation was enjoyable at your location. The drive to venture out and do anything was literally within a few miles. Paradise on the back patio!
8022,131,"Great location, great hosts, super helpful."
8023,131,"The marsh access is AMAZING! And the house is so cute and comfy! It is definitely on a busy road and during heavy traffic times, you will be able to hear it. But enjoy the house for the access that it has to water! Incredible!"
8024,131,Great little piece of paradise! Property exactly how described! The backyard is perfect and throughly enjoyed our stay!
8025,131,"Beautiful view, well appointed. Some road noise, but it is less noticeable with music or TV on. Nice location close to Swansboro and Emerald Isle. Good WiFi for working but no private work space."
8026,131,Amazing place. Spectaculair views and privacy. Welcome basket with snacks was a great touch. Can’t wait to come back !
8027,131,Beautiful location. Super cozy. Love the easy access to the marsh for the kayaks.
8028,131,We loved this house so much! My kiddos loved the Legos and Lincoln logs! and especially loved throwing the net and catching little fish. So many memories created with our short stay. Thank you!
8029,131,"The stay at Jonathan’s was amazing!!! A true piece of paradise! Breathtaking view to wake up too.
I would highly recommend great for any type of occasion. 😀😀😀😀"
8030,131,We really enjoyed our stay. Our kids loved being able to take the kayaks out everyday. The view was wonderful and just a quick trip to the beach. It was very clean with lots of extra touches to make you feel welcome. Jonathon was very friendly and responsive.
8031,131,Great space. We were very comfortable. Kids fished for hours!
8032,131,"This stay is a little slice of heaven!
It’s the perfect combination of waterfront and seclusion!"
8033,131,"Great location. Description was accurate. The house is close to the highway, but it mentions this in the description so it was not a surprise. Beautiful location to view the sunrises and sunsets off the sound, and if you enjoy kayaking it’s a wonderful place to do so!"
8034,131,"Loved the house, the views were amazing. Kayak provided was such a cool idea and we rode out into the water. House is in amazing shape inside, so nice! Loved the snacks. provided!"
8035,131,"Nice clean place, as described. Lots of marine life and marshland good stuff. Great kayaking spot."

8037,131,We had a great time fishing from the backyard and enjoyed relaxing in the hot tub.
8038,131,Beautiful views and relaxing environment
8039,131,"A very comfortable stay for me and the Mrs. Very clean, nicely updated and really nice being on the water. The hot tub and kayak were added bonuses.
Yes, it’s on a busy road, but there is a turning lane, so getting in and out wasn’t bad at all.
The back of the house felt very private and was a nice place to relax. The master bedroom facing the sunrise was also very nice."
8040,131,They are quick to respond and it is close to the beach
8041,131,"The outside of the house doesn’t do justice to the inside. Such a charming home with a beautiful view! Owners were very responsive, and things were done with a sense of urgency. Great communication."
8042,131,Its very comfortable and clean.
8043,131,"Enjoyed our stay! The home is lovely and well appointed. Having kayak access was a nice bonus, and the hot tub and view were excellent. Convenient location as downtown Swansboro is walkable. Would stay here again - thanks for everything!"
8044,131,Jonathan’s home is immaculate and offers beautiful views. My son thoroughly enjoyed the hot tub and being able to jump in the water! The house was nicely renovated and I took advantage of the wonderful coffee station. Only down side was the highway traffic noise at night.
8045,131,Fantastic! Great place and great fishing! Will stay there again
8046,131,THE BEST PLACE TO STAY. It was the most beautiful area - so close to everything we wanted to do and the host(s) made sure we had everything we needed and communicated with us whenever we needed. We will most definitely be making this place our go to ♥️
8047,131,We are already looking forward to staying again soon!
8048,131,"Situated on a busy road, just so you are aware. The place is very cute and well kept, and the hosts are very responsive and courteous to their guests needs"
8049,131,The view in the morning is amazing. Really enjoyed my time there
8050,131,What a wonderful place to stay! Exactly as expected.
8051,132,"Sophia's home was perfect for our one night stay during our travels. It is close to the highway, well appointed, cozy, clean, and the bed was so comfortable, I did not want to get up.....at....all. The porch is screened in, and if the weather had been nicer, I would've enjoyed it.

Sophia is communicative and the listing is as stated and the pictures are accurate. We would absolutely stay again when traveling south. Recommended!"
8052,132,Perfect place to rest our heads traveling to Florida. Easy to get too!
8053,132,One of the best air bnb we stayed out. We stopped here to get some rest from our trip home from florida to ny it was a great one night stay. Awesome air bnb. Will deff. Stay again on our trip down again. Thank you.
8054,132,"We stayed here for 1 night on our was from Canada to Florida and it was the perfect stop. Quiet, peaceful, comfortable, easy to find, clean, welcoming, and had everything we needed. I would stay there again! I asked for a recommendation for a fish and was recommended Pier 41 and it was great!"
8055,132,"Sophia's place was so peaceful, restful, and it felt like home. Super cute.

We really enjoyed the evening sitting outside on the screened in porch. We got to watch the sky and it got dark

Sophia's communication was excellent and she was very responsive. You could not have had it any better than hers.

She even thought of windowshield cleaner. I got to remove the bugs before heading back out on my 12 hr journey.

There is a ramp there for anyone who needs a little help with getting in or who wants to roll in their suitcases.

Loved the coffe bar, too.

I would highly recommend her place ❤️"
8056,132,"Had an amazing night, was so comfortable felt like home for sure. We would highly recommend to anyone wanting to stay a few nights"
8057,132,Thanks for explaining the cleanliness issue. We wash all sheets after every use. There was a stain on a sheet that I missed when remaking the bed. I have tossed those sheets out and replaced those sheets. I strive to keep my home as clean as possible. If you ever have any cleanliness issues please contact me so I can fix the situation. I clean the home my self to insure you have a clean rental.
8058,132,Quiet location to stay
8059,132,"Sophia’s place was just what my daughter and I needed after a long drive from Daytona. She loved having her own room and I loved the spacious bathroom attached to my bedroom. I made use of Sophia’s complimentary car cleaning products she left out. What an awesome idea! We were comfy, cozy and enjoyed a movie!! It was chilly when we arrived but found the thermostat and the place heated up quickly. Great stay!"
8060,132,"Amazing place! Convenient to highway 95 - about 5 min. Peaceful and quiet county setting. The house has all you need for a restful stay: comfortable beds, full kitchen. Organized and very clean! Will definitely stay again."
8061,132,Sophia is a wonderful helpful host and we really enjoyed our night’s stay! Such a cute and clean place with plenty of room for the three of us.
8062,132,"Awesome little coffee nook, beds were super comfortable, quiet location and easy to get back to 95."
8063,132,Beautiful home and host was extremely helpful.
8064,132,"The pictures of this Airbnb do not do justice to the character of the home… this is by far one of the best places we have enjoyed! I felt like an honored guest. There is absolutely nothing I would change about this Airbnb… If I could give a rating of over five in every category, I certainly would. Highly recommend this location except for the times that I want to stay there!"
8065,132,Exceptional stay! Sophia is such a great host. Very attentive and helpful! Was very flexible! The place was such a great place to spend the night. Felt like home!

I'd definitely recommend this place, as it's well worth it and conveniently located right off the 95."
8069,132,Just as described! Everything was clean and bed was super comfortable. Shower was also very nice. We enjoyed the very well stocked kitchen for cooking and all the extra little touches here and there like the coffee bar and some snacks to enjoy! We will definitely be back again if we’re in this area again! Thanks for providing Sucha great stay!!
8070,132,"Wonderful stay! Excellent value. Very clean, easy to access and great communication and directions. Our kids really enjoyed playing in the backyard in the morning. Lots of extra amenities. Amazing stay! We'll be back."
8071,132,"This is a very peaceful house. If you ever need to get away from the city but not too far , this is the place for you. Restaurants are just 10 mins away but you definitely feel like nobody is around miles. After a long day at the toy convention, it was nice to settle down in a quiet house ."
8072,132,"I feel like this is my ""little home"" in Robeson County...This is quiet, country, has good WiFi and a great kitchen. The beds are comfortable and this host is superb!"
8073,132,"So thankful we found this place to spend the night while on a work trip.
We loved the little country house ❤️
Super clean and cozy. Very responsive host.

Thank you so much for your hospitality and accommodation! !
😊"
8074,132,"Quiet place in the country. Well stocked kitchen. Clean property. The hostess was super helpful with my questions going above and beyond.
I would stay here again."
8075,132,Nice home in a quiet area.
8076,132,Sophie’s place was extremely clean and warm and cozy. Had everything you could possibly need. Communication was over the top. Do not hesitate to book this Airbnb and experience true southern hospitality.

8078,132,Would gladly stay here again!
8079,132,"Thanks, I had a group of teens over this weekend. The must have unplugged it. There is a drop cord/surge protector behind the bed plugged in for it. I will get it plugged back up."
8080,132,My family enjoyed this little gem. I would love to come back !!
8081,132,"House is great, just a few minutes from I95 but far enough away you have peace and quiet. The house was clean, nicely decorated and Sophie communicated all instructions very well. Highly recommend if you are traveling through the area looking for an alternative to a hotel. We felt right at home here. Sophie added some nice touches as well (snacks, coffee, hot chocolate etc). Thank you for a great stay!"
8082,132,"The house is roomy and very cozy; easy to find and in a safe peaceful area.

Sophia was sweet and comunicative, and made sure we had everything we needed fir the night.

Thank you and would recommend to others."
8083,132,"Sophia’s place was a home away from home! Very clear instructions. Easy access from the freeway and close to get food. All was 7 mins away!
If I come through this way again I would definitely rent again ! 💕😎"
8084,132,Thanks and hope you have safe travels back home.
8085,132,Sophia was great with communication from beginning to check out. The place was cozy and clean. We only spent the night to sleep as we were road tripping from Florida back to New Jersey but would‘be loved to stay here a few more days. Our family enjoyed the environment as it’s different from where we live and we felt at peace with how quiet it was since we live in the city. Would recommend staying here!
8086,132,"Sophia's place was so comfy and cozy. As someone with mobility struggles, I was really happy to see a ramp up to the back porch and pull bars in the bathroom. The Christmas decorations made the space even more homey. There is some noise from the traffic, but that didn't bother us. There was room to ""camp out"" on the deck and make smores. This home is in the country but minutes to everything you could need. Excellent bnb!!!"
8087,132,"Wonderful little 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom home in the country. Easy to get to Lumberton and to I -95...Extremely helpful host with such a cozy spot for weary travelers!"
8088,132,Sophia’s cute little home was absolutely spotless and so well kept! She went out of her way to make you feel at home. Sophia was amazing at how well she made herself available to answer questions. Everything was so neat and tidy! I loved it!
8089,132,"Quite possibly the nicest stay I've ever had at an Airbnb. The pictures don't do it justice. Sophia's place has comfortable furniture, everything clean and orderly, all the things you could need to feel at home readily available. We had a lovely, quiet, cozy stay. I highly recommend it!"

I would love to come back 💯 for a recommendation. Thank you for the detail with my children"
8097,134,We had a great stay.
8098,134,"We were looking for something that would offer a beautiful location on the beach, that was affordable and allowed us to disconnect for a few days. This beautiful spot completely exceeded our expectations! I cannot say enough about how much we truly enjoyed our time here!!"
8099,134,"Tony and Kimmy thought of everything. Beautiful spot right on the beach! Super smooth check-in. Everything was immaculate. Great towels and bedding—including beach towels and chairs. Even had shampoo and conditioner. Well-stocked kitchen and very generous welcome basket with goodies. We knew the bunks would might be a little tight for our 20 and 14 year-olds, but we only had 2 nights and wanted to be on the beach and they didn’t complain at all. AC and dehumidifier worked great, didn’t even have to turn on the AC in the bedroom. Really great guide book as well."
8100,134,We were looking for a quiet place to ourselves for a few days and this spot was perfect! Everything was easy to locate and directions were easy to follow. We spent a lot of time walking on the beach and sitting on the balcony watching the ocean. We felt welcome and spoiled during our time there!
8101,134,Nice place to stay
8102,134,Such an awesome place to stay! Will definitely be returning!
8103,134,it was exactly what I hoped for and needed in a getaway :)
8104,134,So peaceful. Exactly what I needed for my week getaway
8105,134,"Absolutely amazing.
Can’t wait to go back."
8106,134,"A very nice place for those who want to spend a relaxing weekend. The apartment is very nice, cozy and clean. Great view! Lovely beach! We were very pleased with the trip! We will definitely come again!"
8107,134,"This was the best Airbnb I’ve stayed at. It was clean, it was right on the ocean with an absolute beautiful view right off the deck. It was just the perfect peaceful getaway with everything you’ve need and more.
The hosts are friendly and super informative. It will definitely be a place I’ll visit again and again in the future!"
8108,134,"Myself and kids (19, 16, 9) enjoyed this condo for a long weekend. Communication with the owners was fast and effective. The view was absolutely wonderful. It was truly magical watching the dolphins play and drinking coffee on the balcony. The condo was extremely clean, beautifully decorated and wonderfully stocked with all the essentials for a comfortable stay. In my opinion, the owners went above and beyond to make this experience enjoyable. (Beach towels, sand toys, beach chairs) Snacks (for the kids) and a fresh bag of coffee for me💜 were left on the counter. This was truly an amazing weekend. We can't wait to book our next stay here, the next time we are visiting out son station on Camp Lejune. I highly recommend this condo to anyone looking for a stress free vacation with amazing views."
8109,134,"Kimmy & Tony were the best hosts! They were so kind & responsive!! We had the most wonderful stay in their sweet condo! I would, most definitely, stay there again."
8110,134,"This is a great place to stay right on the beach and at the north end of Topsail Island, which makes it very nice. The bar /market across the street is fun and friendly. When the beach is wider it will be great- they are working hard at it. Everything in the condo was immaculate and Kimmy was a great correspondent- even while I was there, but I did not look at my emails 'til I got home this evening. Thanks Kimmy. Thank Tony for his paintings of the beach: I paint too, so enjoyed."
8111,134,"This place is awesome! It was clean, quiet, and was right on the ocean. Everything we needed was provided. Parking was easy and only steps from the unit. The hosts were responded immediately and were very accommodating. We would definitely love to stay here again."
8112,134,"Tony & Kimmy's home was AWESOME! They were very friendly & responsive.
The ocean view was AMAZING 👏
Home was very clean & quaint.
Their home decorated with Tony's art work which was beautiful. FYI you will need to bring your own ice, as the refrigerator doesn't have an ice machine.
I would come back again for sure!"
8113,134,Very nice place. Great view. Kimmy was exceptional host and was very responsive.
8114,134,Our stay was very comfortable and the place was clean. The view of sea from patio is the best part of this stay. Instructions were clear and host was very responsive and made sure everything was perfect. Thanks for the goodies tho
8115,134,"Tony's place is right next to beach, you have a private deck and feels like you are in the middle of ocean. You can hear the waves sound..Its wonderful experience. I would definitely visit again."
8116,134,"One of the best air b&b stays we have ever had, place was beautiful, quiet and just how described! Great hosts! Definitely recommend, we will be booking again in the future!"
8117,134,Very beautiful sights and and amazing place to just get away.
8118,134,"This was such an amazing experience. Tony and Kimmy were extremely the best hosts that I have ever dealt with from the goodies and the gifts. This place was surely a hidden gem. We sure will be coming back. Loved listening to the waves crashing and the dolphins swimming by every hour. Thanks again Tony and Kimmy for your hospitality. Matt and Patty from Baltimore, MD"
8119,134,great view great condo
8120,134,"Dolphin View felt warm and welcoming, from the goodie basket to Tony and Kimmy’s quick response to questions. It was the backdrop for a perfect mother-daughter-granddaughter weekend. 10/10."
8121,134,We absolutely loved Dolphin View! It was clean and the view was phenomenal! Our family thoroughly enjoyed our stay and we are looking forward to coming again!!!
8122,134,Very cute and clean condo with an absolutely gorgeous view. The gift basket was a very thoughtful and sweet extra! Will definitely stay again!
8123,134,Lovely place! I’ll definitely be back!
8124,134,"Serenity. The pictures only hint at the view, which is spectacular. I visited for a few nights in the fall, read my book out on the deck and hardly saw another soul."
8125,134,"It was super clean, and the communication with the host was always prompt. The snack basket was a nice touch and came in very handy! We greatly enjoyed our stay."
8126,134,We had a great weekend and enjoyed a cute little tiki bar across the street.
8127,134,"Very nice, on the beach rental. The location was perfect for sitting on the balcony and watching the waves, or opening the doors to hear the sounds of the beach from the comfort of the living room. Hosts left a welcome basket of treats and gifts, and everything you needed to enjoy coffee in the mornings. Very clean! I will definitely try my best to make my way back here."
8128,134,"Location was perfect, the condo was clean and we had a fabulous stay!"
8129,134,We had such a nice and peaceful stay here. The place was very clean and just as stated. Tony and Kimmy were very good at communicating. We loved sitting on the front porch and watching the waves crash right in front of us. We would have loved to stay longer if we could have and would love to come back!
8130,134,Summed up in one word…. Amazing! Great communication. Directions to find the place were spot on. The view was Beautiful! We had such an awesome time and made memories for a lifetime!
8131,134,Absolutely beautiful place and location! I had a great stay and really appreciated having things like coffee and tea provided so I could have coffee each morning to watch the sunrise over the beach. The patio perfectly overlooks the ocean and Tony made sure the home was fully stocked with everything I could need to make it a true beach getaway.
8132,134,"We had an incredible stay! This is our 2nd year staying in N Topsail. We appreciated the tide schedule that Tony and Kimmy left and we were able to spend 5 full days on the beach without any trouble of high tide! We loved Cancun Mexican Restaurant, and Ricks in Sneads Ferry. The kids loved SurfDog in Surf City. We went to the Karen Beasley Sea Turtle Hospital (a must!), and were lucky to watch 3 turtles be released this week. The condo was clean, quiet, and the perfect location. The added touches of coffee and a snack basket were so thoughtful and welcoming."
8133,134,"Our stay was perfect! The condo was small but perfect for the four of us. My kids first time at the beach was wonderful, being right on the water. There was everything we needed in the kitchen to make a simple hello fresh meal we had brought with us, and plenty of towels and blankets. The kids love standing on the balcony to watch the waves and an evening thunderstorm out on the water. We will definitely be booking again!"
8134,134,What a great little condo! Super cute and clean! Kimmy and Tony are amazing with their communication! Would highly recommend renting from them!
8135,134,Had a great time with family and a wonderful stay in this condo! Very clean with a lot of special touches that made it great for all!
8136,134,Awesome stay!!!! Beautiful place and really clean and nice place. Amazing communication.
8137,134,This cozy-on-the beach condo was the perfect destination to capture the tranquility of morning beach sunrises and the beauty of Topsail Beach sunsets. The balcony was the perfect location for listening to the waves crash to the shore. The condo is cute and cozy and comes with so many amenities that made the stay a true home-away-from-home.
8138,134,"Great value and location that isn’t too crowded, had a great stay!"
8139,134,This place was very clean and can’t beat location. The only downside at all is it got hot in bathroom and bunk bed area due to AC setup. But truly was such a great location and very clean so not something that bothered our stay at all. For a small family or a couple retreat this place is perfect. Having the ocean at your feet is pretty amazing!!
8140,134,"If you are considering North Topsail Beach and Dolphin View is available, do not hesitate. The location is amazing - even with the high tide coming up to the buildings there are beaches on either side of the condo buildings (8 in all) that are a super easy walk.
The condo is very well appointed - even has sand toys! The décor has the added bonus of original artwork by the owner, Tony. The beaches are quintessential North Carolina beaches. We found lots of shells & even a couple of shark teeth!! We hope to come back someday!!"
8141,134,Great place to stay with an even better host. Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a true beach escape. Great location. Beach right in front of you with an incredible view and a nice little local bar right down the street for something to do at night.
8142,134,Had a lovely stay. The view was beautiful and so close to the ocean. Will definitely book again when I come back to topsail.
8143,134,Cute little place with an awesome location. The kids loved every second of our week long vacation! Couldn't have asked for a better view. Tony & Kimmy are amazing hosts.
8144,134,"You couldn’t possibly be any closer to the ocean. We loved hearing the waves crash and sitting on the balcony all times of day. The condo is well equipped and Tony is a great host, leaving a nice welcome gift and everything needed for your morning coffee. Tony provided a tide schedule which made it easier to plan our days. High tide makes the beach unusable so we planned other activities. There are public beaches you can visit during those times. We too a water shuttle Lea island one day and took a tiki tour of the inter coastal in another day."
8145,134,This place was awesome! Very clean and location was perfect.
8146,134,The host was very attentive to our needs and responded quickly to our questions.
8147,134,"This condo is beautiful and well kept. Great location with beach access. Loved being able sit on the deck with such great views of the ocean. at high tide, the beach is mostly covered, but there are other close public beach options that are larger."
8148,134,Super awesome place to spend our family vacation!! We had an amazing time! We look forward to making it our family tradition.
8149,134,"Our stay at Dolphin View was amazing! The condo was clean, cozy, and quiet. The balcony had a fantastic view of the ocean. Communication with Tony and Kimmy was great, they answered any questions we had and were very nice. Would definitely recommend to anyone wanting a relaxing place to stay in North Topsail Beach."
8150,134,"Fantastic place to stay. So super clean and stocked with all of the necessities needed. Great communication from Tony and Kimmy. Easy to follow instructions on how to get to the condo and how to get in. We loved sitting on the balcony and watching the ocean. Access to the beach is not accessible during high tide, but we were able to walk to the first building and use the steps there. Would highly recommend this condo and am looking forward to stay there again!"
8151,134,"Lovely hosts and a great, clean, comfortable stay!"
8152,134,"Great place, great hosts."
8153,134,"This was a perfect stay. Clean accommodations. Easy parking etc.
Bring groceries and such, not much around. If you have kiddos there is limited low tide playing time, but we made it work.
Great hosts!"
8154,134,"Had a wonderful 4 night stay! The space was very clean and bright. Just steps from the beach. It was so nice to sit on the balcony and watch the waves tumble in and leave the door open to hear the sounds of the ocean waves. We ventured out and did some shopping in Surf City, had dinner in Topsail, watched the sunset twice at Serenity Point(so awesome), spent a day in Wilmington and another day at Cape Lookout. Such a great area for sun, fun, history lessons and more. Can’t wait to come back for a longer stay. Our hosts Tony and Kimmy were awesome!"
8155,134,"Tony’s place is a great place to stay in North Topsail Beach! We enjoyed our visit and wish we could have stayed longer. The deck is perfect for watching the waves crash while drinking your morning coffee. We did have to use the public beach access during high tide, but it was still great. Thanks for your hospitality!"
8156,134,We had a great stay! Fantastic hosts and would stay again!
8157,134,"I can’t say enough good things about the condo and its hosts. Beautifully decorated, immaculately clean with all the little touches that turn a really nice visit into a wonderful experience. It’s quiet yet still close to restaurants. An incredible view of the ocean from the balcony while enjoying morning coffee or a glass of wine in the evening. We planned a trip back on our drive home! Only wish I could give it 10 stars!"
8158,134,Very cute and clean condo right on the beach! The owners were very kind and communicated with us so well. I would recommend to anyone. We did have to go to a public beach access during high tide because the water comes right up to the stairs to the deck! Great place though!
8159,134,What a perfect getaway! Spent the night for my moms 64th birthday! We walked to the beach and walked to a great dinner nearby. Beautiful house. We listened to the waves every moment we were there.
8160,134,"If you’re headed to Topsail, this is the place to stay! Their place was clean, comfy, and relaxing. All the amenities you could need. The location is perfect for watching the waves right from the porch & 10-15 minutes to the stores. Tony and Kimmy were quick to respond and accommodating. Can’t wait to stay again!"
8161,134,Great condo. Everything was just as described and the hosts are very responsive. We loved seeing the dolphins from the deck. Quiet atmosphere with great sun rise views.
8162,134,If I could give more than 5 stars I would! This place is fantastic! Everything you need for a relaxing beach vacation is here! The communication with the host is wonderful! They are so thoughtful! The view is amazing! We will definitely be back to stay here!
8163,134,Great stay. Beach access only at low tide but not a big deal
8164,134,Wonderful stay I must say! Everything was just so perfect that we didn’t want to leave. We will be staying again very soon!
8165,134,"Me and my boyfriend really enjoyed staying at this place. The apartment couldn't be any closer to the water unless it was literally on it. We really appreciated the cleanliness of the apartment and cute touches to the decor and place in general. I also had a special request for the place and they made sure to have done, which I fully appreciated. They were very thoughtful and accommodating! Would recommend to anyone."
8166,134,"Dolphin view has just that! almost everyday of our stay we saw dolphins right from the patio!
Dolphin view has everything you could possibly need nothing was left unthought of! From the softest blankets to extra toiletries if you happened to forget yours. We cooked most of our meals here in the condo and they have everything. Pots, pans cooking sheets even toddler drinking cups( our son was so excited to see cups just for him). It’s truly felt like a home away from home. We had a 4 month old and 4 year old with us and our 4 yr old didn’t want to leave! We are already planning to come back !"
8167,134,"Enjoyed every moment of our visit. Love the simplicity and warmth of the condo. Great views, peaceful, and inviting. Topsail has been a favorite of ours for over 27 years."
8168,134,"Super cozy and clean condo! LOVED it, and right on the ocean. Excellent wifi, super soft linens and towels and lots of goodies provided so I could just show up with my suitcase and feel like I was at home. Really kind hosts and I will definitely be back to stay again!"
8169,134,"I highly recommend this lovely apartment right on the beach. The place was very clean and the kitchen well supplied. Our weekend get-away was during a cold spell but the space heaters mad the place nice and cozy. My favorite part was sitting on the deck watching the sun come up and the dolphins jumping. I give this place 2 thumbs up. Lisa of Raleig, North Carolina."
8170,134,Great stay!!
8171,134,"I truly enjoyed my stay here! They were quick to accept my request and respond to any questions, allowed me to check in early and allowed me to extend my stay. They even left me a sweet little gift and it made my day!

It was cozy and had everything I needed! I loved the sunrise and seeing the dolphins every single morning! I’d stay here again and would recommend this place to others as well!

Thank you again!!!"
8172,135,"Our stay at The Twig was the perfect escape from Chicago. Perched on top of a hill, it was a serene and secluded getaway surrounded by a picturesque forest and mountain views. The tiny home was just the right size for my partner, myself, and our small dog. We made good use of the tub after long days hiking—even came in handy for our muddy pup. Though, our favorite feature was the windows— especially in the misty morning waking up to the sun rise. The plot had ample space for our dog to run around while we sat by the fire pit. Moreover, the surrounding forest had plenty of dead branches for the fire and even had a few morels! When we weren’t hiking , we really enjoyed visiting the nearby town of Sylva for coffee at White Moon and meals at some of our favorite restaurants in Asheville. This was our second stay with Abbey and Ethan—we were glad to see their responsiveness and thoughtful design carried over into multiple homes. Highly recommend the Twig for any city dweller."
8173,135,The Twig was absolutely perfect for our anniversary getaway! The space was clean and super cute and the hosts were very helpful and responsive if we needed them. We will definitely be back!
8174,135,Abby and Ethan have done a great job with their stellar cottage. The cottage space is super cozy and has all you need. The wooded views made time around the fire pit exceptional. Worth your time to visit.
8175,135,"We had a fantastic time at the twig! Highly recommend a long soak in the tub and then a drive on the parkway, and finish up the night with a lovely dinner in Waynesville at the sweet onion!"
8176,135,"First off, I'd like to thank Ethan and Abby for a wonderful place to stay! They were quick to respond to all of my questions and were super helpful. I was worried at first about the drive up the mountain because of other reviews. I drive a small kia soul and had no issues getting up and down the driveway even when it had rained all day. The tiny home itself is
breathtaking. Simple and tasteful. I stayed for 2 nights and took a bath about 5 times because, oh my goodness! Took my pups up the hill behind the home during a break in the rain and could see all the mountain tops. Beware of the briars. If you are looking for a peaceful, quiet, and secluded place. Look no further!"
8177,135,Abby and Ethan’s stay was perfect!
8178,135,"This place was GORGEOUS! The only critique would be that the tub wasn’t very functional, as you can only fit one small person. In a hiking community a shower would be preferred. However, the views and peaceful atmosphere was definitely worth it!"
8179,135,Beautiful. Authentic. Very peaceful place. Bathtub was amazing . Everything we dreamed.
8180,135,The Twig was the perfect place for my solo hiking trip. I loved that my pup was able to tag along too. The place is cozy and looks just like the listing. Abby and Ethan were great hosts and communicated with me throughout the stay. The tiny home was clean and stocked with all the essentials. I read previous reviews and brought along my own firewood and had some movies downloaded to my Netflix beforehand. Downtown Sylva was close by and had some really cool breweries and a cute town to walk through. I look forward to checking out the hosts other locations.
8181,135,"Book it!!

Very peaceful stay—-very private. Loved the soaking tub and views from all the windows.

Grab food on your way in—-once you get there you won’t want to leave.

Driveway is a bit intimidating but I made it up just fine"
8182,135,"We really enjoyed our stay. We had our dog with us, and he was able to run around due to it being private and quiet. We definitely recommend, and we will look forward to our next visit!"
8183,135,"This place and the hosts are 10/10. Suggestions for the guests is to bring wood just in case wood is wet there. Also maybe lighter fluid or some kind of fire starter supplies. Download movies from Netflix and such so you can watch the tv or airplay.
The place was clean and well stocked with supplies which was amazing. They have lots of blankets. The chairs out there have a cup holder that will hold your wine which is super cool. It is so serene and peaceful with no one around. The mountain view is spectacular. There is a creek that is wonderful to see. The hosts picked a perfect location to put the tiny house. They are very communicative."
8184,135,"The Twig was a peaceful getaway. Amenities, surroundings, etc. were exactly as described or pictured in the listing. A big selling point is the bath and my only complaint is the absence of a shower. The tub has a detachable shower head, but there is not a curtain to prevent spraying water everywhere if standing. We were unable to use the TV due to lack of Wifi and difficulty connecting personal hotspot, but this was not important. We felt comfortable letting our 1 year old lab wander because of the seclusion. We loved being able to see the mountains through the trees during our winter stay, and I can only image what it looks like surrounded by green in the summer. We spent most of our time hiking off the BRP, which was a 15 minute drive, and stopped briefly in Sylva for coffee and to browse an outdoor store and bookstore. The hosts were communicative and kind."
8185,135,beautiful space and perfect for getting away from it all!
8186,135,The Twig is great. Very peaceful with awesome views in the winter. Close to hiking and the BRP but also in a perfect location to explore Sylva and Waynesville. We also really enjoyed being able to bring the pup!
8187,135,Beautiful place and surroundings. Needed to use hotspot from phone for tv due to no Wi-Fi but luckily still had service. Really enjoyed the town of Sylva and was an easy drive to Asheville and surrounding areas. Pretty steep driveway but had no problems with a RWD sedan.
8188,135,"This cute little cabin made for a quiet, relaxing mountain weekend! We thought the amenities were amazing and especially loved the fire pit and tub! We already talked about booking again in the future. 10/10 would recommend!"
8189,135,"The Twig is a very cute and cozy stop convientally located for the Blue Ridge Parkway, or a day trip into Great Smoky Mountains National Park or Asheville.
We ran into issues with hot water during our stay, but it was addressed and it would be fun to stay in one of the other Nordic & Spruce tiny homes hosted by Abby and Ethan in NC!
** If you want to try a super yummy Mexican restaurant, try La Poblana - great for a post-hike burrito! We also enjoyed White Moon Coffee in Sylva, and exploring a few downtown bookstores.
Bring a pair of rain boots - the parking area is squishy when it’s wet."
8190,135,"This was a great little getaway. Very neat tiny home and such a beautiful area! Also, I recommend going to check out the downtown area of Sylva, which has plenty of food options and a few breweries."
8191,135,"We loved this tiny house it was peaceful and quiet. Although we were looking forward to taking a bath in the nice tub the most but during our stay, we had no hot water. The following morning, we had no running water. It was cold outside, but it was definitely a bummer."
8192,135,Very good
8193,135,"Really peaceful and quiet, great location to check out from the day to day."
8194,135,"We had a great time. However, pipes were frozen our first night there and we had no water. They sent someone to fix the next day and refunded us for the first night."
8195,135,This place was amazing! We highly recommend going in the winter while it is snowing. It makes the location feel magical! We had an amazing experience with Abby and Ethan and their willingness to be so accommodating. We are already planning our next trip for the summer! If you get the chance to stay at this location it really is the perfect place to unplug from the world and have some one on one time!
8196,135,"Great spot for a quick romantic getaway! The hosts are really friendly and communicative; we met two friendly dogs who ran up to say hi (much love to randy and disco). The road up is steep so 4WD or AWD is suggested. The interior was great; quaint but unique. The bed is super comfy, the bath is great and the natural light from the windows is great. 10/10 would recommend and stay again!"
8197,135,A great weekend getaway! Definitely recommend if you need a break from every day life. I would come back in the future!
8198,135,Abby and Ethan were very accommodating. The place looked just like the photos. It was very cozy and comfortable!
8199,135,"Very fun weekend we had, Abby and Ethan were very responsive. Overall would go back!"
8200,135,We really enjoyed our mountain getaway! We came during the coldest weekend and a winter storm and Abby & Ethan were very responsive to help with all of our questions!
8201,135,The Twig was a peaceful and tucked away cabin and everything you need for a mountain get away. Downtown Sylva is close for take out and there is a small functional kitchen in the tiny home. Overall we had a wonderful relaxing stay! The hosts were communicative and responded quickly.
8202,135,Beautiful home on a peaceful and private property surrounded by mountains. Felt surprisingly spacious. The bed was very comfortable and loved the bathtub. You cannot beat the location being 10 minutes from Blue Ridge Parkway access and 35 minutes from Great Smoky Mountain National Park. We loved our stay here!
8203,135,Great stay. Very private and new. Clean and loved our stay!
8204,135,"We loved our stay! This was the perfect, quiet, cozy spot for a getaway for two. It’s a beautiful tiny house with peaceful surroundings. We enjoyed time by the fireplace too. Abby and Ethan were super responsive."
8205,135,"Great stay at a cute little tiny house. Directions very accurate. I was glad to have AWD going up the driveway while it was raining, but you could probably make it without AWD. Very close to Sylva. Don’t miss innovation brewing!"
8206,135,"Me and my partner enjoyed our stay at Leisr’s place. The only two issues we had were the linen were not 100% clean (had dog hair/human hair all over the bed) and the hot water ran out fairly quickly. Other than that, the location was private and it was really cozy."
8207,135,We absolutely loved our stay and are looking forward to booking again!
8208,135,"We loved our stay at this cabin! It’s so nicely finished and was more spacious than we expected. Bed was super comfy, the whole thing is a cozy vibe."
8209,135,Moving from fl to Ohio and stopped for the night was amazing wil be back and will check out all the other ones they have
8210,135,"I booked this cabin for my birthday I was looking for a quiet place for a romantic getaway but at the same time enjoy some skiing which is 27 minutes to cataloochee ski area the place is beautiful and as described. The host were very communicative, the place is clean. Overall if you’re looking for the feeling of a relaxing and quiet atmosphere this is the one for you! Just keep in mind that the place is situated in a mountain"
8211,135,Wonderful little tiny home. The tub was very relaxing and everything was clean. Great communication and clear instructions for arrival/check out. Would definitely stay again if we are ever back out this way!
8212,135,This is the perfect spot for a couple’s getaway! Such a visually beautiful spot that has everything you need for a cozy stay. We brought our pup and he had the best time running around! Get prepared for friends to ask you to send the listing after you post about your stay!
8213,135,Great place! Unfortunately the hot water heater was not working during our stay but the hosts responded quickly and compensated us for the inconvenience and i am convinced it will be fixed by the next visit. Couldn’t be happier with the location and the resolution to the problem.
8214,135,"We felt right at home in this little cabin. The bed was so comfy, communication was great and we will definitely be back. It was so dreamy!"
8215,135,Beautiful place in a great location. We really enjoyed the peaceful spot with all the essentials.
8216,135,Beautiful and cozy place to stay. Great host who was very responsive. Would definitely book again
8217,135,Beautiful remote and quiet location. Perfect place to unplug.
8218,135,"Tiny house is amazing!! Perfect for a solo or couple's getaway.

Has everything you need to enjoy some relaxation while connecting with nature.

Couple things I would suggest:

Try to check in before night time as the drive up is quite daunting.

If you go during the winter season, bring an extra blanket or heater.

Drip the water at night to avoid frozen pipes."
8219,135,"Very cute place, loved the location and decor!"
8220,135,amazing place!
8221,135,This stay was amazing!!! The space was perfect from the inside to the views! I’ll definitely stay here again. The road to the home can be scary if you drive up at night for the first time.
8222,135,This was a great place for the night stay we had in mind. It was about 10 minutes or so from downtown Sylva and we could really take in the nature sitting around the chiminea at night. We had no issues with our stay and the host were responsive throughout.
8223,135,"This place is absolutely amazing! Centrally located to multiple towns/activities! Home was super clean, had everything needed for a pleasant stay! Got a special visit from Disco and Randy (you'll have to visit to find out who they are!) Home was secluded near the top of the mountain, if felt like we were in the middle of nowhere which was perfect! Thanks Abby and Ethan, we will definitely be back!"
8224,135,This place is incredible! Not to far from Sylva! Beautiful night sky! Perfect spot for a weekend getaway!
8225,135,I enjoyed my stay in this place I definitely recommend it .
8226,135,great location!! clean and warm place. 20 minutes to one of the highest peaks in the Appalachians
8227,135,We really enjoyed our weekend at The Twig. We were the first people to stay there and it is the perfect place for a couple’s getaway. Very private and secluded. The bed was very comfortable and it was nicely decorated. Excellent communication with the host. They were very prompt in answering any of our questions. We would definitely stay there again!
8228,136,"Beautiful break from chaos! Thanks Corey for starting our son’s 13th birthday road trip off right! Mayo Lake was beautiful! Fishing and kayaking were so peaceful! Could hear nothing but the wind through the trees, birds in the trees, and occasional wakes hitting the shoreline from passing by boats."
8229,136,Corey was super helpful and even came down to make a fire for us! We had a one day staff training and he allowed the small crowd of 12 to hangout for a bit during the day. Great location for what we needed.
8230,136,"The place was just what we needed. Relaxing, quite, beautiful. Corey was very friendly and available for any questions."
8231,136,The rental was absolutely lovely and perfect for a weekend retreat. The porch and the view were my favorite part. Corey was an excellent host and very responsive when I had a question about wifi access. I also enjoyed walking at Mayo Lake Park which was only a 5 minute drive. Another perk was a nearby(large) Dollar General just in case you forgot something! Really enjoyed my time there!
8232,136,"Corey is a great host. Met him at the gate as I was coming in where he greeted me and gave me a little more info. He even remembered it was our anniversary. Corey was very responsive. He’s a very personable guy. Saw him around a few times and had great conversation.
This place is just amazing. Pictures posted did it no justice. The lake view was amazing and we spent much time at the dock lounging. Our little one completely enjoyed himself.
The inside is beautifully decorated. A lot of thoughtful touches. Very clean and well stocked kitchen. Bathroom is very spacious and sparkling. The chairs were very comfortable and would easily make you fall into nap mode. We slept on the King bed and it is by far very comfortable and love that if you leave the blinds open at night or get up very early you would be blown away with the beautiful sunrise.
This place is very quiet and peaceful! We enjoyed the fact that we weren’t drawn to our phones but to take great pictures. Highly recommend!"
8233,136,The location is beautiful! Was able to sit outside with a cup of coffee and just look at the surroundings while listening to the wildlife. It was very relaxing! Corey was very responsive and was helpful with any and all questions we had. He reached out to us before we were scheduled to get there to see if we had any questions. Overall fantastic stay!
8234,136,"Most relaxing and enjoyable fishing trip i have had in many years. Felt right at home! The place was spotless and very well stocked. The beds we very comfortable and it was nice and quiet. Cory was an amazing host, answered questions and chatted with us about his beautiful property. We WILL BE BACK!"
8235,136,"Great retreat! Beautiful, quiet, and secluded lake front property. Everything we needed for a few days away and close to local restaurants. Corey was a fantastic host!"
8236,136,Corey is a great host! His place is tastefully decorated and spotless!! We look forward to going back when the weather is warmer and enjoying the lake!!
8237,136,More beautiful than pictures
8238,136,"This was my first time using this app and im very glad I found this place. The host was very nice and responsive. It was very clean inside and out, and the location was beautiful."
8239,136,One of the most beautiful places I’ve been 😍 and the host Corey was amazing! I really recommend this place..
8240,136,A very peaceful getaway. This place was amazing!!!
8241,136,"Great location right on the lake, most reasonably priced option around, especially for what it offered. Had everything needed for a short trip, including a fully stocked kitchen. Corey was friendly and accommodating, i couldn't have asked for a better experience."
8242,136,Beautiful waterfront view. Lake access. Enjoyed downtown Roxboro on an outing.
8243,136,"I rented Corey's apartment for my elderly parents because I ran out of room at my house for visiting relatives during Christmas. It was the coldest weather we've had here in a long time. My parents were toasty warm every night. No issues with heat or hot water.

Also there are a number of stairs leading down to the entrance. Folks in their 80's often have trouble but the grade and width of the stairs posed very little difficulty for them even at night because the area was well lit.

They were very comfortable here and truthfully, enjoyed getting away from all the holiday commotion at my house!"
8244,136,Such a nice place in a beautiful spot. I would love to come back when the weather is better to enjoy the peace and tranquility.
8245,136,Very clean and cozy place!! Will definitely be back when it’s not freezing out.
8246,136,It was great
8247,136,We loved your place and thank you for all your help!
8248,136,Excellent accommodations! Very nice!
8249,136,"Corey was so accommodating to me and my friends as we booked back to back nights at the house and made things so easy with checking-in and checking-out. Overall, the view of the lake was beautiful and the house was very spacious and quiet. Would definitely book here again!"
8250,136,Lovely Airbnb! Very courteous and kind host! Thank you!
8251,136,"Our stay was great! We really enjoyed the view and being able to get out onto the lake. Corey was great and proactive in making sure we had a good time, yet we also had all the privacy we needed."
8252,136,"Loved staying here. The space was comfortable and the location on the lake perfect. Nicely decorated, even had fishing poles for our use. Corey suggested The Old Country Club Steakhouse and it did not disappoint! Wish we had more time to spend here."
8253,136,This was one of the best airbnbs I think I’ve ever stayed at. I’m so grateful to have had the chance to experience this beautiful property.
8254,136,Corey is a great host! The place is beautiful and I will definitely be booking with him again!!
8255,136,This is a great getaway! The space is perfect for lake days and relaxing evenings. Sitting on the private dock in this quiet cove made for a wonderful weekend!
8256,136,Great place to stay. The host is very accommodating and we are happy to say well be back. What else can we say but that? Right ?
8257,136,Return trip to Corey's was definitely worth it. Great place for a quiet weekend at the lake. Corey's great and very responsive/helpful. Will definitely come back again (:
8258,136,Beautiful views....very clean...
8259,136,"Perfect little getaway for me and my hubby!

Kayaking was an added bonus!"
8260,136,"Great views, host was awesome, would definitely recommend to friends and family and we are planning so go back soon!"
8261,136,"We’ve stayed at places across the country from San Francisco to DC. This is the best spot we have found. If you are looking for a relaxing time on the lake, this is the perfect spot. Also, the host is very communicative and helpful. I’d give the place six stars if I could!"
8262,136,This place was amazing. Better than the pictures. Clean. Check in was easy. Corey was great. We had lots of privacy. Went kayaking on this beautiful lake. We’re in town to visit friends. Wish we had planned our time to have stayed longer to have enjoyed the place more. Cannot say enough 👍
8263,136,We enjoyed our stay even though we didn’t have the best weather. Perfect spot to bring a boat. Well stocked kitchen and very comfortable beds. 5 stars!
8264,136,We had a great stay and the view was beautiful! Had everything we needed and the bathroom was to die for! Will definitely be coming back here!
8265,136,"We loved our stay at Corey’s place!! It was beautiful, clean, and the view was awesome!! He lives on the property so he was easily accessible but also gave us privacy. Communication was excellent. Check in and check out were both easy. We had a nice conversation with him on our first day there. Super nice guy!! We would definitely recommend his place!! We are hoping to visit again soon!!"
8266,136,"Corey's place is exactly what we were looking for. A great downstairs apartment right on the lake with updated kitchen, bathroom and comfortable beds. We loved the kayaks! We also tied tubes to the dock and spent all day in the lake and it was great. Corey's awesome - very helpful, kind, and open if you have questions or anything. Would definitely recommend and return."
8267,136,"Corey was a great host, everything was clean and organized. Gorgeous place!"
8268,136,"I planned this last minute mini getaway for Father’s Day with my boyfriend and our daughter. Although it was only 1 day/night it was wonderful and much needed.
It was private, cozy and had everything we need.
We got to use the kayaks which were probably our favorite part, grilled (charcoal grill) and after a day of activities we settled in and watched tv.
Corey was great and super friendly, good communication.
It’s definitely a hidden gem. Will be staying there again."
8269,136,"This place is as great as described. It’s a cozy downstairs unit. Even with our weekend filled with events, My family and I were able to take full advantage of being on the lake. We kayaked, we enjoyed sitting on the dock, we swam, and we were enamored with the view. Corey was the perfect host. He checked in when our check in was later than expected because of storms, he followed up to ensure we had all that we needed. And, we even chatted for a bit before we left about our next visit! We are excited to come back."
8270,136,"Beautiful, well decorated place on the lake! Great place to get away from the stress of life. Would definitely go back!"
8271,136,"Amazing experience. Great views. Corey was very nice, welcoming and communicative. Chatted and welcomed us upon arrival but then respected our privacy. Couldn’t have asked for better place to rest and recharge on looooong car ride back to NY from FL. Liked the setup even the little things like the “framed” tv, just saw pride and care in the whole setup. Enjoyed viewing and taking pictures of all the military honors and memorabilia. Thank you to you/yours that have served! Seemed like you have everything needed for a longer stay, liked the kitchen/appliances and looooved sizing and whole bathroom overall! Also wished we were there longer but even got time to appreciate quite the evening show with all the “lightning bugs.” Thanks for sharing such a beautiful place! If you’re considering here and appreciate the outdoors book it, you won’t regret it!"
8272,136,We had such a wonderful time at Corey's beautiful lake house. The house itself was spotlessly clean and very tastefully decorated with all amenities and many thoughtful touches. The outside patio complete with chairs and a picnic bench was where we spent most hours of each day relaxing and catching our breath while looking out over the lovely lake. Corey went out of his way to make sure that we were comfortable even providing a mattress topper when we requested one. He also arranged for us to charge our electric vehicle. We hope to come back again and again. It was hard to leave.
8273,136,We loved this place. It was very peaceful. We fished from the dock and caught a few catfish and bass. We cooked on the outside grill and sat at the picnic table for all our meals. The few from the porch was beautiful. We sat and watched the rain. Everything was perfect!
8274,136,Great place! We loved it for our weekend trip! Definitely recommend.
8275,136,What a great find! Beautiful Lake front house. Very comfortable and clean with lots of space. Full kitchen with everything we needed. Kayaking on the lake was spectacular.
8276,136,Really enjoyed our stay! Will definitely be back!!!
8277,136,"This property is an absolute hidden gem, made even more so by the incredibly kind host, Corey. He went out of his way to make sure that we had everything we needed for our girls weekend. He even had a brand new picnic table delivered. It is clear that he has put so much effort into making his guests feel so comfortable.

The house is immaculate with updated appliances and attention to detail. Very private and quiet.

The lake is serene and so very peaceful. Don’t skip out on this opportunity!!!!"
8278,136,"I had a wonderful time!
It was clean and neat, wonderful view of the lake, and was not far from the city of Roxboro. Corey is awesome! He's super nice and any question I had he responded instantly."
8279,136,"We had such a fun time staying at this sweet lake side home. It was such a nice getaway to relax in the quiet. This place had beautiful lake views, and wasn’t far from Mayo Park and downtown Roxboro. Corey was always prompt to answer our questions and made our stay very comfortable. Would love to come back!"
8280,136,Great place no complaints
8281,136,Just bring your own food
8282,136,"Very clean, great quality, peaceful and quiet with a beautiful view. Comfortably furnished. Corey is very kind and responds quickly. I will definitely be back for future stays!"
8283,136,"Great place to stay! Corey was an awesome host! Big bathroom, comfy beds, stocked kitchen, clear instructions and the view of the lake is serene. My friend and I had a great overnight stay!"
8284,136,"What a gem! The space was super clean, the gorgeous shower was wonderful, the view unbeatable. We loved that we had the use of the dock which really took the cake. Corey was easy to communicate with and everything was better than described. Highly recommended!"
8285,136,Great quiet getaway! Very private and super clean with amazing views. Look forward to coming back.
8286,136,1st time at air bnb. place was great and very clean. Corey was a great host and responded quickly when I had any questions. We would gladly stay there again. Far better than the hotel experience that we are used to.
8287,136,The place was totally awesome
8288,136,"What can I say? The stay checked all the boxes..clean, great location and beautiful views. Corey is a wonderful host and remembered I told him it was my husband's and my anniversary!"
8289,136,Quiet and clean. Overall great value. Nicely updated suite up above the lake which made for a beautiful back drop.
8290,136,"Even better than described! It was super easy to get to, clean, and Corey was awesome to book with. Not too far from town, but also not too close. Will definitely be staying again!"
8291,136,"Corey’s place is really great. The location is peaceful and quiet, and Corey is great at communicating. We arrived rather late in the evening, and he left all the spotlights on for us to help us easier find the home. We definitely hope to stay again in the future."
8292,136,"Corey was an excellent host! He was very nice, communicated efficiently, and made sure our stay was nothing less than amazing! I loved the cleanliness and how comfortable the accommodation was. You have access to everything you need. The area is quiet and sooo peaceful! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"
8293,136,"What a great place to unplug and recharge! Delightful guest suite with everything I needed for a comfortable home away from home experience. The east windows looking out onto the lake at sunrise...delicious. This spot is high on my list for future return visits! Thanks, Corey!"
8294,136,"Beautiful views, very clean. Perfect place for a getaway. Corey was very accommodating. The bedroom has a beautiful view of the lake. Lots of natural light. The bed was EXTREMELY comfortable. The bathroom is beautiful. Location is very peaceful. It was nicer than I expected and look forward to going back."
8295,136,Great stay! Corey had everything that I needed to have a comfortable stay. All of my questions were answered on the page of instructions included in the front room. Corey also walked out to greet me when I arrived. Instructions for check in and check out were clear. I would love to stay again!
8296,136,View was absolutely perfect.
8297,136,Great get away place. I would go again!
8298,136,Beautiful setting just steps from the lake. Located in the country less than 15 minutes from downtown Roxboro. The perfect getaway. I was in Roxboro for work. When I sent my wife pictures she decided we needed to go back together/Very spacious top notch accommodations. Corey is a very accommodating host who makes sure everything is just right.
8299,136,Great place to stay in the day time n to relax at night. Will definitely stay here again! Corey was great n very friendly.
8300,136,"This was our first visit at Lake Mayo and we enjoyed the warm hospitality of Corey. Our room was so clean. This is just perfect place for relax, fishing.We will be back again!"
8301,136,5 stars worth every dollar 💵
8302,136,"Absolutely loved this home! I can’t say enough good things about our stay! The location is perfect, the home was extremely clean and the king bed had to be the most comfortable bed I’ve ever slept in! Will definitely book with Corey again!"
8303,136,Highly recommend! Great stay!
8304,136,Corey was great. His place was hit with lightning the day before which knocked out the outlets in the kitchen. The fridge and oven were still operational and he bought a couple stand up lights which fit right in. The location is spectacular. I only wish I could have stayed longer. Super chill and peaceful place on a lake.
8305,136,GREAT HOST!
8306,136,The pictures you see are what you get. The back porch view and lake sounds were my favorite part. I felt like I was home without the chores that go with being home. I’ll never stay in a hotel again!
8307,136,"Absolutely perfect place - shower/bathroom was gorgeous, comfy beds, great amenities and an absolutely beautiful view. I hope to be back!"
8308,136,"Absolutely beautiful location, perfect for escaping life for a bit. You won't have cell service, so make sure you get everything you need in advance of your trip, the closest reception is about a mile up the road, but the wifi works well enough. The place is cozy and homey, dishes and cookware is provided, and I really appreciated the can of bug spray that was left out! The bed was super comfortable, and the couch and chairs were cozy enough to snooze in. In the morning I was surprised to open the door and be greeted by two friendly ducks. I left them alone and they left me alone but I am sure they were hoping for handouts (which they didn't get). Make sure when you drive down the driveway, you go *left*- I didn't pay attention to the numbered sign and accidentally had to turn around in someone's driveway. Whoops!"
8309,136,Wonderful place by the lake.
8310,136,"Adorable cottage on a lake, well equipped, and super friendly host. Had a great time staying at Corey’s!"
8311,136,Great view of lake with the house. Corey made the place feel like home.
8312,136,Quiet nights under the stars by the lake then inside to a lovely shower and comfy beds. Great escape
8313,136,"Very pleased with this location: It met and exceeded expectations. Corey provided everything we needed, including lifejackets - which was huge. Kids had a great time. The space was very well decorated, clean, and beautiful.
As animal lovers we absolutely fell in love with the sweetest kitten who was hanging around (found out it belongs to the neighbors but it was always at our door). There were also two very amusing and demanding geese who occasionally came around. I suggest not feeding them near the house or else they will stay there and poop. Instead, feed them some corn down at the dock, is my advice."
8314,136,"Super vacation rental, great communication! Our family enjoyed our time there. Corey was great & had everything we needed. Couldn't have been easier! We hope to visit again!"
8315,136,Great location. Loved fishing off the dock and the views from the patio at night. Was able to catch fish both days we were there! Corey responded quickly when I inquired about the paddle boat and we were able to use that and enjoy the lake life! Upscale bathroom and plenty of sleeping space. Enjoyed our 2 day visit for a parents mini getaway! Will return. Easy to follow directions.
8316,136,Nice quiet place.
8317,136,"We had a great week at Corey's place. From making friends with the local ducks to paddling around the lake to watching boats go by and just relaxing, this is the perfect place for a getaway. The kitchen is clean and easy to cook in. The bathroom is very generous. Beds are comfortable. You will get wet on the porch when it rains though!"
8318,136,Corey is the best host! His place was great and ideal for our fishing trip!!!
8319,136,"Great room, looking forward to returning!"
8320,136,"Nice place off the beaten path. We decided to stop here on our way to the OBX. Very relaxing and secluded. Our kids loved the paddle boats, canoeing and fishing off the dock."
8321,136,"We had a great stay at Corey's place! The lake views are beautiful, and we enjoyed swimming, kayaking, and hanging out on the dock (with the company of a couple friendly ducks). The bed is comfortable, the bathroom and shower are huge, and the kitchen had everything we needed. We played a couple of excellent local disc golf courses (Rockness Monster and Sasquatch) and did some hiking at Mayo Lake Park. We hope to come back soon!"
8322,136,"Hopefully there will be some changes in the future, provided to Corey.. The view is beautiful."
8323,136,Thank you for our stay at your place! The view is beautiful!! Love the shower!!
8324,136,"An absolutely amazing stay! It was so nice to get away in a small town and be secluded by the lake. The house is beautiful and modern, and has a nice big kitchen to cook in. The kayaks and paddle boat down at the dock were also such a nice addition, and gave us some great activities to do when we weren’t soaking up the sun on the dock. Corey was a great communicator and so wonderful to work with."
8325,136,"We really enjoyed our stay here!! It was very peaceful and relaxing, the lake was beautiful and there were kayaks and a paddle boat we could use. The inside was clean and modern looking. Overall, it was great!"
8326,137,very wonderful and relaxing place! we enjoyed the view and how peaceful it was!! loved it!!
8327,137,"Speechless.. this is truly a sanctuary. Every detail of this home was built with impeccable mindfulness, designed around sacred geometry and in harmony with the surrounding land. It is the perfect place for rest, reconnection, meditation, and healing. We feel so grateful for stumbling upon this place last minute and the responsiveness of Blox and Kristin to accepting the listing evening of. Absolutely perfect!"
8328,137,"Overall the pictures don’t do it justice, even on a rainy weekend it was a great getaway and wonderful place to stay. Looking forward to future trips."
8329,137,"Immediately wowed as soon as we arrived! The shell dome is striking in appearance on the outside and beautiful on the inside. We used the sauna at sunset and it was one of the most amazing experiences. Really unique amenities (outdoor shower, firepit, sauna, outdoor view, projector TV, etc.) Completely in awe with the construction of this home. One of the most comfortable and peaceful places we have ever stayed."
8330,137,We loved it so much we stayed another night
8331,137,"My wife and I had a great stay. It’s a fantastic place to unplug and relax. The dome was very comfortable, the sauna was great and the outdoor shower was fantastic. We would definitely recommend staying."
8332,137,Excellent stay. This Airbnb has superb amenities that made it a unique experience. It is close to downtown Asheville yet secluded enough to enjoy a tranquil escape from the city.
8333,137,Lovely place to stay. We will return soon for another get away.
8334,137,"Best place we’ve ever stayed! It was so tranquil and cozy- the perfect spot to celebrate life and love. Loved the herbal tea blends, sauna, fire pit, library, outdoor shower and peaceful beautiful surroundings. I could’ve stayed for days….."
8335,137,"Such a great stay! We loved every part of it and the location is nice and secluded but close enough to a bunch of breweries and food. It was a little out of our budget, but I don't have any regrets and would definitely stay again because of how nice it was to relax in the dome and make use of all the amenities. Everyone was also super responsive and easy to work with! We look forward to staying again!"
8336,137,"Wow! What an experience did we have at the Nautilis Shell Dome! It was definitely a weekend to remember. The experience we had was one of pure zen, relaxation, and enjoyment. Kristin and Blox were so thoughtful and intentional with so many things to make their guest’s experience one of pleasure and convenience. From the HUGE shower head with hot water for the cold nights, to the heat adjusted mattress, they paid attention to detail and had their guest’s comfort in mind. The fire pit and sauna were a huge hit as well. It created for a nice, relaxing, and peaceful night. We thoroughly enjoyed it. Between the views, the seclusion, the tranquilizing amenities, and the calmness it provided, the dome is surely one a kind. If you are looking for a getaway with a twist or pure zen, the Nautilis Shell Dome is highly recommend!"
8337,137,"My boyfriend and I had such a great stay at the nautilus dome!! We wanted an adventure for our 2nd anniversary, and this place provided the perfect escape from our busy lives. The space was absolutely beautiful inside and out, the sauna and the rain shower worked perfectly and the view from the deck was breathtaking and peaceful all day long. We’ve been talking nonstop to our friends and family about how wonderful our stay was. We will definitely be back!!"
8338,137,We had a great time! Even with rainy weather there was plenty to do inside! Would very much recommend!
8339,137,"A lot of thought was put into this Airbnb, it was peaceful and as advertised. I highly recommend visiting!"
8340,137,Our stay at the Shell Dome was wonderful. Blox and Kristin have really gone above and beyond to provide a special experience for their guests. Close to great hiking spots and plenty of food options within a short drive.
8341,137,"This was our favorite airB&B that we’ve ever stayed in.
The best way I could describe it would be absolute zen.
The indoor space will get as warm or as cool as you want with the built in wall heater/air conditioner.
The bed has dual heating pads. My wife likes to sleep warm and I like it cold, so she turned her heated pad on and I left mine off, we slept perfectly.
The sauna was amazing! Very easy to use. There’s literally step by step instructions posted on anything you use.
The fire pit/chimney was so cozy to sit next to with a nice fire going. (Firewood etc… is right there beside it) so it’s easy to get going.
The outdoor shower was incredible.
Honestly guys… do not second guess booking this place. We cannot wait to go back! A+ all the way!
I’m already looking forward to coming back one day."
8342,137,Very peaceful and cozy place would definitely recommend!!
8343,137,"One of the best places we have ever stayed! Very clean, small, peaceful, and had everything that my wife and I could’ve needed. Absolutely will be staying here again"
8344,137,"Amazing!! Highly recommend this beautiful experience. We enjoyed our stay and we were inspired by the design of the space. It was truly peaceful and perfect. The outdoor shower was wonderful, too."
8345,137,"This was the perfect place to be on Valentines Day, or anytime you want to just relax and enjoy the tranquility of this beautifully built, well thought out comfortable space. We cant wait to come back, it really exceeded our expectations!"
8346,137,Thoroughly enjoyed our stay! We will definitely be back!
8347,137,We loved this place! So peaceful and very convenient to Asheville. We will have to visit again.
8348,137,Wonderful retreat to see nature.
8349,137,Just awesome!
8350,137,"We wanted a unique overnight getaway. And the dome provided it! Very peaceful and private feeling ( even though there are a couple of houses around, never felt intrusive at all). The dome is so cozy and just immediately makes you feel like you are somewhere special and cool. The shower was a great experience, even in the cool weather. Lots of hot water! We cooked a meal and everything you need is there. The projector and screen worked great (Roku is active so you can stream). This was the perfect overnight and we hated to leave so soon. Hoping to return very soon."
8351,137,such a nice and beautiful place to stay!! will be going back!
8352,137,Absolutely breathtaking! Everything I imagine and more. Perfect romantic weekend getaway! Definitely recommend it and will be back! Thank you 😊
8353,137,Just stop looking! This is the one!!! Absolutely 100% cannot wait to come back. My sister and I do a yearly 24 hour sisters trip to Asheville. It’s a short sweet trip and finding someone to host us for one night isn’t always easy. We are so thankful for the shell dome! It was absolutely incredible and full of serenity. You’ll enjoy every inch of this place. I was concerned I’d be cold (I’m always cold) but the dome was super warm and the heated mattress was exquisite. Thank you for hosting us! I can’t wait to come back and bring my wife next time.
8354,137,The dome was such a unique experience. Every detail of the property was thoughtfully designed. I hope to have the opportunity to come back one day!
8355,137,What a unique and lovely spa-like experience! Thank you!
8356,137,"I absolutely LOVED staying at the shell dome. This was my first solo trip and I was sooo relieved at how comfortable I felt the moment I stepped out of my car on the property. The space is gorgeous and you can definitely tell every part was built with love and hospitality. The outdoor shower, though I was very skeptical at first, was my actually favorite part. Even though it was around 45°F out during my stay (January), the hot water provided enough heat and steam to keep it comfortable. The view was also spectacular from the mountains, to the stars, and I even got a glimpse of snow right before I left. And the teas were AMAZING! I could keep going on and on. 11/10 experience!"
8357,137,"I will 100% be back. I recently moved away from Asheville and this is the perfect place to come when I am missing it. The views are amazing and its so peaceful, but still close to downtown with a beautiful drive."
8358,137,"My partner and I were so taken away by the oasis you created for guests to enjoy! It was so clear how intentional you were in making design decisions that will always foster a connection with nature and the outdoors. These, combined with the natural warmth of the shell dome itself provided the most ideal atmosphere for us to truly retreat with one another. We loved every little detail like the dim lanterns out on the deck at night, the wide assortment of special blend teas, and the most beautiful wind chimes to fall asleep and awake to. Thank you for letting us experience your dome; it was the perfect quiet space we needed."
8359,137,"incredible place with a very peaceful vibe.
can't wait to go back :)"
8360,137,"This unique structure was not only tidy, it was super cool to stay in, the views were beautiful, and the whole experience was exactly the getaway we needed for some peace and quiet. Everyone should try it at least once!"
8361,137,"We had a wonderful stay in the Nautilus Shell Dome. The design, kitchen, and all furnishings are thoughtful and high quality, creating a peaceful stay. The small touches were also nice (e.g., HDMI cable provided and ready to connect laptops to the projector!). We stayed with a baby during a cold snap in late December, and it was perfectly warm for us too (great insulation). We had a wonderful fire outside too, overlooking the farmland. We'd definitely stay again."
8362,137,"This place is absolutely a gem! Peaceful and unique in every way. Kristen and Blox were super friendly and made sure we were comfortable. It was the coldest it had been in years and I really wanted to use the outdoor shower but didn’t. Blox even reached out to me to let me know the pipes
were frozen and was hoping the pipes
Would thaw before we got there. We were cozy inside on the pull out couch drinking wine and watching Christmas movies on Netflix. It was toasty warm inside and the bed was even toastier with the heated mattress pad. I wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy the space. We will go back for a weekend. Perfect night’s stay!"
8363,137,Kristin and Blox were amazing host. The place was beautiful and exactly what we needed for a get away well over due. They even went above and beyond and has balloons and rose pedals on the bed as a surprise to my fiancé. We will definitely be making this our annual place to get away too!! Thank you both for everything it was greatly appreciated!!
8364,137,Beautiful! Cozy. We loved every minute.
8365,137,"Staying here was so amazing. It was extremely peaceful and absolutely beautiful. Everything was super clean and comfortable. I just can’t say enough good things about it. I will definitely be staying here again. It was so wonderful. The shower was so cool. It’s obvious they take so much pride in providing a getaway for people and it shows in every detail like providing robes and slippers and shower shoes, all of the beautiful decor and furniture and providing such a unique and peaceful experience for people."
8366,137,Place was absolutely Beautiful and unique. The view was breathtaking and everything was only 15-20 mins away there was so much to do around town. I highly recommend it! It was a beautiful fun experience.
8367,137,"Blox and Kristin’s place was fantastic. The dome is perched up on a hill overlooking a beautiful pasture. It was a very peaceful and comfortable setting. It was cozy inside with everything you need. We enjoyed using the French press when making coffee (organic local coffee was provided).

Like others, we loved the outdoor shower! I very much looked forward to morning showers. Thank you Blox and Kristin for the great stay!"
8368,137,"Well-built and incredibly comfortable. The only downside to our trip was the wet weather which kept us from taking full advantage of the fire pit, outdoor furniture and overall property. Anxiously awaiting the installation of the sauna! Four wheel drive is recommended :)"
8369,137,"So glad you found everything comfortable! The weather was a bit challenging. It had been raining daily for well over a week before your arrival, hence the slightly squishy roadway. I'll mention for the readers of this review that we drive a Prius which has always been very happy on our driveway so 2 wheel drive cars don't be shy! Either way, as a response to the rains we topped it up with fresh gravel this morning - didn't want to schedule it while you were staying and risk disturbing you. Hope to have you back once the sauna is in and there is sun in the forecast!"
8370,137,"What a complete disappointment....it was having to leave!! Everything was warm, inviting and properly set up for our retreat. Waiting for the sauna to make its appearance and we will certainly be returning! Missing the shower, the views and the true 'tranquility' ❤"
8371,137,You scared us with your opening line! Ha! Glad you enjoyed everything :)
8372,137,Such a peaceful getaway! Definitely a place to escape everyday life and just enjoy some time to yourself or with someone close to you.
8373,137,"Just book it!! Me and my husband have been to many Airbnbs and this one was by far our favorite. Everything was so clean, and the area was very peaceful and private. We loved our stay and hope to be back."
8374,137,"We had an amazing stay which truly included tranquility and rest, all because of the beautiful touches the host put into this airbnb. Everything was comfortable and relaxing from the outdoor shower, fire pit, to exceptionally clean indoors.

Do yourself a favor and book this rental. Your desire for a peaceful retreat will thank you."
8375,137,Very nice
8376,137,"Incredible, charming dome for Glamping. Very beautifully decorated/furnished and the bathroom and dome were heated (below freezing in this visit). We would have loved to stay even longer than we did!"
8377,137,AMAZING!!!!!!!!!! This place turned a “one night passing through” into memories we will cherish. The space was incredible and you could tell it was made with a lot of love and care. The hosts were simply amazing! Any questions we had they answered right away. It is is also not far away from the best restaurants around! The teas that are available to you were so good and went perfect with the movie night on the projector. They also had local coffee for us in the morning. This place will not disappoint! And even a diffuser with amazing smells that add to the comfort of this unique serene space.
8378,137,"Wow! The stay at Blox and Kristen’s dome on the hill exceeded our expectations in every way.

First of all, the pictures do not do justice to the experience of staying there.

The property is set back off a winding road on the hill. You come down a tiny driveway between two working farms and then drive back up another hill to the dome itself. As we parked the car, the attention to detail that Blox and Kristin put into the property was already evident. The dome itself, the deck built around it, and how it was set on the hill thrilled us even before we walked up the stairs to get inside.

My partner Darla had always wanted to stay in a yurt but never had a chance before. When she saw the glass window entrance to the dome and walked inside said she would be spoiled for any other structures like this one. The full refrigerator, king-size heated bed, the little cooking area, and the couch with a view of the farms below and the mountains in the distance all made this place feel like home for the week we stayed here.

The outdoor shower was different from anywhere else we had stayed before, but we quickly grew to love it too. While I have taken showers outdoors while camping, the instant hot water and the views of the mountains and moon at night were something else! They had a place for a fire outside and all of the wood and kindling we needed to get a fire going quickly, and we enjoyed walking the property itself.

Finally, Kristin and Blox were gratuitous hosts who stocked the draws with custom loose tea, in the freezer was some of the best coffee I’ve ever made, and there were spices galore for cooking. They were helpful with anything we needed, had a great deal of info about the area, and replied to us quickly. As I hinted at above, their warmth was evident in the way that they set up this entire experience.

I could go on, but you get the idea. We highly recommend giving this dome a try, and we definitely plan to come back!"
8379,137,"What an exceptional work of art you two have created. My partner and I live in Asheville. We booked the dome to have a special date night. I was awestruck from the moment I arrived on the land. The view of the rolling hills gives such a feeling of spaciousness and calm. The dome itself is such a striking design. I love the all of the colors and textures with the sexy green velvet couch, neutral tones with dark accents and live wood accents. You can feel how much thought went into curating this space. Loved having a cozy movie night with my sweetie.

I wasn’t sure how I would feel having the shower / separate from the main space, but it was not an Issue and encouraged us to enjoy the gorgeous and cozy outdoor space. I felt like I was at a fancy spa or bathhouse. The shower was so warm, both of us fit under the shower head easily. We had enjoyed cuddling up by a fire to enjoy some wine and together. We will definitely come back. It was such a sweet retreat."
8380,140,Great little place to stay on a quiet dean end street only two block from beach access. Was able to ride our bikes pretty much anywhere we wanted to go. Fantastic location between CB and Kure beach. Our dog loved the fenced in yard! Mickell was very friendly and responsive. Our trip was very relaxing and enjoyable!
8381,140,Had a last minute change in plans and had to book something quickly. Mickell approved my request immediately and was very responsive. The house was so beyond cozy and the location was perfect. The unit itself was welcoming and had everything we needed. This is a wonderful getaway spot for the weekend and I will absolutely come back.
8382,140,Thanks Amanda!
8383,140,Great place within a short walk to the beach. Quiet with a vacation vibe. Easy to relax here.
8384,140,great place
8385,140,The cottage was so cozy and definitely fit the beach aesthetic. Very close to everything and walking distance to beach access. Very clean and loved rye decorations!
8386,140,"Was pretty private and within walking distance to a beach access. Close to everything in town. This place was clean, nicely decorated and well equipped with necessities. Very happy with our stay."
8387,140,Great spot for a few days at the beach. Had all the amenities we needed for thanksgiving due the well stocked kitchen. Would stay here again.
8388,140,"Great Beach house.
Clean.
Perfect location.
Great amenities.
Nice neighbors.
The games were a bonus!
Just like home."
8389,140,"The home is well appointed with the essentials and then some, including nice touches like board games and high quality coffee. Mickell was a great host and went above and beyond to accommodate our needs. My partner and our dog enjoyed the short, two minute walk to the beach. A few restaurants are located within a mile and can be walked to on the backstreets so you don’t have to worry about walking the busy main road. I recommend taking a stroll down to the Spot, a bar down the road from the unit. The area is residential and quiet. The porch was perfect to let the dog roam around off leash on, and the tenants downstairs made no noise that we could hear, so it was a very peaceful stay. Would absolutely book again."
8390,140,We had a very good stay at Mickell's place! Great location just a few blocks/minutes from the beach access. The home is cozy and my dogs loved the stay as well. Gave some feedback to Mickell in private but no deal-breakers.
8391,140,"This place was awesome.

Just a short walk to the beach and overall a cozy and peaceful place.

We had a great and relaxing time and would recommend this place to anyone.

Host was very nice and was good to communicate with."
8392,140,The Mermaid Tales Too was the perfect get away for me and my pup! She did NOT want to leave - I had to drag her down the stairs! Mickell was the perfect host and I enjoyed meeting her family while they were in town visiting. We hope to come back VERY soon!
8393,140,We enjoyed our stay- the place is so convenient to the beach and restaurants!
8394,140,"We had a great stay at Mickell's place. It was very convenient location to the beach, sightseeing areas/ ice cream stops and shops. The place itself was cozy and we loved having an evening cocktail on the deck after putting the little one down. Speaking of little one's, Mickell was kind enough to have a pack n' play all set up for us and had age appropriate toys available! It made set-up and take-down a lot easier with a toddler :)"
8395,140,Mickell was an excellent host! This is a great spot only a short walk away from the beach. Perfect location for both Carolina Beach and Kure Beach. Definitely recommend!
8396,140,"We loved our stay! The location is an easy walk to the beach, the street is quiet, and the bed is super comfy. Never slept on a king sized mattress before! My girlfriend adored the decoration, the place was clean but felt like very homely as opposed to a strange hotel room. The value for this location is amazing. Check in was super easy and check out was the same. We'll definately stay here again when in the area!"
8397,140,"Our stay at Mermaid's Tale was nothing less than great! Mickell's place is very welcoming and set up nicely to have everything you need for an enjoyable stay. Mickell is very responsive and extremely pleasant to work with. I highly recommend her place for a couple or a small family. It's convenient to Carolina and Kure beaches, restaurants, boardwalk, etc. Very comfortable accommodations and pet friendly. We will definitely be back!"
8398,140,"Mickell's place was amazing...cute, comfortable, adorable beach decor, great location. Mickell was kind, responsive and hospitable! The only slight drawback were steep stairs. Doable for us, but alittle challenging for my old dogs. Looking forward to our next stay! Thanks Mickell for the opportunity to make new memories!"
8399,140,Great and homey stay. Very quiet.
8400,140,"Mickell offers a fantastic location to enjoy Carolina Beach! With very little planning, we were able to have chair/umbrella set up for the 2 block walk to the beach, right in front of the public access entrance! The cozy feel of the location and comfort of the balcony listening to the surf and looking at the stars was priceless. And Mickell is good people as we got to meet and chat. No regrets. HIGHLY recommend."
8401,140,Mickell made sure our baby sons first trip at the beach was amazing - she had a pack n play and other things for us upon arrival which we appreciated! Her home is super cozy and homey and the distance to the beach is amazing! We had a great weekend!
8402,140,"Fantastic location!! 2 blocks off the beach, easy walk or bike ride. Mickell had all the comforts of home for us AND our Doggo!! Nice quiet neighborhood! Mickell’s description is spot on with 1950s bungalow. A little aged character but some nice upgrades! Mickell was also GREAT and helpful with communication and quick to reply. Definitely recommend a stay!"
8403,140,Mickell was communicative and friendly. I wonderful host id stay there again for sure.
8404,140,"House was VERY close to beach, and was pet friendly with a fence around the entire house. Had a fireplace (didnt use) and a grill (did use, there was only one scraper between the upstairs and downstairs, but not a big issue at all), had an amazing time. Was able to wakeup minutes before sunrise and make it to the beach before it happened. Amazing experience and would suggest it to anyone looking to visit carolina or kure beach."
8405,140,"I’ve never stayed at an Airbnb that felt more like Home than this. Stop thinking about it and just book , you will not regret it!"
8406,140,Excellent location close to everything
8407,140,We had a great trip but our stay here was even better never felt so at home ! I always dread trips because of the comfort but this home is a home away from home for sure loved it and Mickell was amazing very friendly and the communication was excellent!!
8408,140,Super cute place! Very clean! Would stay again!
8409,140,Very sweet little spot close to the beach. Comfortable and has everything you need
8410,140,Great location and home for a beach get away. I will be going back
8411,140,"Very cute home MINUTES from Carolina Beach! Quiet, enough space, and you definitely feel 'at home' away from home."
8412,140,We had a great experience at Mickell’s place.
8413,140,We loved Mickell's cottage! Perfect location and perfect for a dog and his two humans! We would definitely stay here again!
8414,140,"Perfect beach getaway. Short walk to the beach, close to the greenway trail for a run/walk, and easy access to shops and restaurant. Would definitely stay here again"
8415,140,"Loved my time here! I'll be back, for sure. The furniture is super comfortable. The bed was so nice, I didn't miss my bed at home. The road is quiet and peaceful and yet you're just a 3 min walk to the closest public access. We could hear the waves from the porch. We met the host by chance and she's really kind. We were given privacy the whole time but she was quick to respond if needed. She even gave us a flexible check-out time because no one was checking in behind us. If you're looking for a small, quiet place to stay, this is worth the consideration."
8416,140,"The home was well appointed, extremely clean and a very comfortable bed."
8417,140,"Super clean, pet-friendly, and two blocks to the beach!!! We stayed on the off-season and wanted for nothing. Thoughtful beach-cabin style throughout added to the vacation feel. There was also a comfy bed and secure fencing for letting our dog outside off-leash. Would definitely stay again."
8418,140,"Excellent location, one block from the beach."
8419,140,very cute and quiet spot right across from the beach
8420,140,"Mickell’s place was just perfect. It was so clean that it almost felt like we were the first people to stay there, and she had the space equipped with every amenity you could need. We especially loved the location - it was just a short drive to Fort Fisher where we could avoid some crowds and have our dog on the beach all day. Truly a great spot - I cannot recommended it enough!"
8421,140,Mickell was an excellent host! We loved that we were able to bring our dog. The house was nice and cool (good A/C) and had coffee and toaster. Short walk to the beach. If you come to CB you MUST eat at the Shuckin Shack (our favorite).
8422,140,The house is only 2 blocks from the beach. It’s very clean and the host communicates very well. Bed is very comfy
8423,140,"I've stayed at about 20 airbnb homes and Mickell's is tops! Perfect for dog lovers. Everything was simple, easy and welcoming. And so close to the beach! Loved it"
8424,140,"Mickell was great and so sweet. She made sure we had everything we needed and more. Me and my family and dogs stayed on the top. Although, the stairs did get tiring it was worth it. Not a long walk to the beach, and very quiet community. Such a CUTE home. I would definitely go back. 💙"
8425,140,"Great location, everything you need, very clean and comfortable. It was very quiet and relaxing."
8426,140,"We had a great stay, the place was awesome. communication was great! Overall, enjoyable place...I hate that we had to leave early due a family emergency. We will definitely be back."
8427,140,"Great place, easy walk to the beach. Will recommend to other couples for a great getaway."
8428,140,"We had a blast while at our stay for our mini vacation getaway! We choose to stay on the 2nd level of the home and it had everything we needed and more. The space was great! It had nice homely touches everywhere you looked and there was plenty of room for 2 adults and 2 dogs. The area was very clean and we felt very safe and comfortable during our stay. The home is a very short walk to the beach, 5 mins. We definitely would recommend this to anyone looking for a vacation Abnb!!!"
8429,140,"short walk to the beach, and decent drive to places of interest"
8430,140,"We had such a wonderful time! Everything was perfect. Highly recommend staying here. It's SO close to the beach which made it so nice. We walked down first thing in the morning and saw the sunrise, so it helped being so close. We also had the pleasure of meeting our host and she's just so sweet and extremely friendly. We loved being able to bring our dog too. He's very friendly but has some pretty strong anxiety, especially traveling and he was so comfortable!"
8431,140,Super comfy/cozy one bedroom apt on quiet cul-de-sac with everything you may need for a home away from home stay. Excellent communication with Mickell. Will be returning.
8432,140,"Great little beach cottage, great for a couples weekend getaway. Less than 5 min walk to the beach and just down the road from Carolina Beach proper."
8433,140,Fenced yard was very nice for our two small dogs. Close to beach. Was clean.
8434,140,"My husband and I stayed in the top of the cottage with our two dogs for a few nights. The place is very clean, but also cozy and homey - not the uncomfortable ""sterile"" clean and boring atmosphere of a hotel room. We liked the fact that the cottage was obviously a real person's cottage, not just a company, if that makes sense. Just made our stay more homey, like I said.
There were adorable decorations everywhere, thoughtfully rolled up towels, and all the essential kitchen tools for coffee and staying in to cook/eat.
There was a tv and plenty of outlets for phone chargers or whatever you need to hook up.
The fenced in yard was was great for our pups to run around some. And it was clear/clean so we didn't have any issues with our dogs getting into something harmful or dirty.
The street was quiet, and we were there for 4th of July night - obviously we heard fireworks from afar, but we weren't kept up by loud neighbors or music or anything.
The host was also great with communicating via messages and handwritten notes about what to expect upon arrival, rules for leaving, and even just leaving her phone line open for any questions/concerns.
The location is nice as you aren't too far from the beach OR ""civilization.""
You can easily walk to the beach right up the street from the cottage. You can get to Fort Fisher State Park in maybe 10-15 min depending on traffic. But it's also not too far from things like chain grocery stores/pharmacies if needed (like if you forget a medication like dummy me lol).
I would definitely recommend staying here. 🥰"
8435,140,Very cute cottage! You will sleep well as there’s no noise on the street. Super clean. I couldn’t fault the cleanliness and I’m rather obsessive. The neighbours are very nice and quiet . Large decking area to relax and get the morning sun. The yard is shared as clearly stated so if you don’t like sharing your space or you want privacy this may not be for you especially if you have dogs. The yard is VERY convenient however . I took a baby gate so my dogs weren’t up and downstairs all the time which was useful . I also took my own beach chair as I wasn’t sure what was available. Everything worked well and it was a lovely experience. The host is very kind and very helpful .
8436,140,"Had a fantastic stay! PERFECT location. Can hear the ocean from the beautiful breezy porch. Quick walk to Kure beach. I have a Jeep so I enjoyed driving onto the South End of Ft Fisher beach. The bed and couches were super comfortable. Loved that it's dog friendly. Didn't bring our pupper this time, but will next time!"
8437,140,"Awesome place to stay! Close to the beach, but, on a nice quiet street. Fenced yard, perfect for our dog. Cozy beach decor. Loved everything about it."
8438,140,Super cute property. Location is great. Short walk to the beach. Great communication from the owner. Enjoyed our stay!
8439,140,Great small place only 2 blocks from the beach. Host is very helpful and communicative. Great fenced in space for your pups. Would definitely stay here again.
8440,140,This place was so cute and cozy! I felt right at home and my dog really enjoyed the fenced in yard! The location was so convenient as well since the beach was about a block within walking distance! Would gladly stay here again!
8441,140,"Great location, quick walk to beach. Very comfy bed. Couldn’t hear neighbors below. Our dog enjoyed the fenced in yard."
8442,140,"This place is great!! 5 minute walk or less to beach, great quiet street. Ample space that was cozy and immediately felt relaxing. Mickell had all we needed to make our stay comfortable. The fenced in yard was fantastic for our dog to roam freely. We’d love to stay here again in future."
8443,140,Mickell’s place was very accommodating to us and our dog. She gave us some recommendations of places around the area and they were all very nice. The place itself was very quaint and cozy. You can tell that a lot of love and care went into it just by looking at it. Overall a great vacation and we will definitely be back!
8444,140,Wonderful location - easy to walk to the beach. Comfortable bed! Would definitely stay again.
8445,140,Great place. Location is nice and space is perfect. Perfect for a beach vacation!
8446,140,Mickells place was perfect for our weekend getaway. Only a block from the beach. The neighborhood was great. The BNB had everything we needed and a nice comfy bed. Plenty of beautiful yard for our dog to sniff out.
8447,140,Cute cottage and excellent location! We loved staying here and appreciated the clean accommodations and tasteful touches that made us feel at home. Fenced in yard was great for our dogs.
8448,140,"Amazing distance from the beach, lovely property with tons of personal touches and great amenities."
8449,140,Very cute place. Would definitely stay again.
8450,140,"This place is an absolute gem! We were the first people to stay here since it has been remodeled and let me tell you it was amazing! Perfect communication, perfect location, perfect everything!"
8451,142,Everything about our stay was perfect! Wish we could have stayed longer. The view and sound of the falls/ water were healing and peaceful. This is an experience not to be missed - far beyond your typical Airbnb.
8452,142,"Thank you, Mark! We love this house so much, it’s always great to see people really appreciate it! We hope to host you again soon and hopefully for longer next time!!"
8453,142,"A true gem, the perfect place to relax and reset. Can't wait to go back in different seasons."
8454,142,"We are so glad you enjoyed your stay, Carrie! We look forward to hosting you again soon!"
8455,142,We were only able to stay 2 nights but I left as rested as I am after an average week of vacation. 2 days were great and would also love to stay for 2 months.
8456,142,"Amazing, love to hear that it was such a respite for you!!"
8457,142,"My husband and I loved it, we are checking our calenders to see when we can go again."
8458,142,"It's such a special place isn't it? We love it too, so glad you had a fabulous time and we look forward to having you back!!"
8459,142,"Though we had some difficulty finding the place initially, once we were there, we were blown away! The home itself was gorgeous, the grounds were beautiful, and the waterfall back noise was so peaceful. We spent most of our time there but did venture into Mt Airy for some great food and pampering at a spa one day. We found everything we needed to prepare meals during our stay and had plenty of supplies like toilet paper, paper towels and trash liners even though we had brought our own. This was a fabulous home and we will definitely be back!"
8460,142,So glad you loved it Janet!!!
8461,142,"Perfect spot on a creek! We always try to find the old, historical places to stay in and this was great. We stayed one night and it had all we needed to feel comfortable. Our kids enjoyed the waterfall and sitting on the deck. We went to a grocery store about 15 mins away and we were able to cook dinner and breakfast easily in the kitchen. We’d love to come back next time we’re passing through."
8462,142,"We are so glad you loved it, Renee and would love to have you back anytime. It's a very fun place for kids in the summer when they can play in the creek. :-)"
8463,142,Great setting with great potential.
8464,142,"Hey Chuck, glad you enjoyed it!!"
8465,142,Was a magical experience would love to come again for experience worth the stay.
8466,142,"Beautiful spot and elegant restoration, thank you!"
8467,142,Awe so happy to read this!! Thank you!!
8468,142,Absolutely beautiful! We had such a great time. Very clean and well laid out. Will definitely rebook.
8469,142,Love! Thanks so much! We look forward to your return
8470,142,Had a nice stay- hosts were very responsive throughout our stay. The balcony is amazing!
8471,142,So glad you loved it!!
8472,142,"Great little get away .. beautiful views .
Plan a return trip in warmer weather."
8473,142,Wonderful! We look forward to having you back- the mill is so beautiful in all 4 seasons
8474,142,magical
8475,142,That's a great one word descriptor- it is magical!! Look forward to having you back-- summertime is reaaaally sweet playing in the pools!!
8476,142,"We enjoyed the rustic, simplistic charm of the Millhouse, which effortlessly blends with the serene and peaceful countryside surrounding it. The trees, the river and wildlife can be comfortably viewed and admired while relaxing on the large open deck of the Mill."
8477,142,Wonderful! So glad you loved it!!
8478,142,We stayed at the Mill and absolutely loved it! What a wonderful place ♥️ It was private and well equipped. The beds and linens were comfy. We felt right at home! And Taylor and Dylan were amazing hosts. We would absolutely stay there again! Thank you Taylor and Dylan!
8479,142,Beyond exceptional view. Decided to stay another night and they owners were very nice. Plan to stay more often.
8480,142,Awesome!! So glad you loved it- look forward to having you back
8481,142,The mill was a great place to stay for the weekend. The waterfall outside was beautiful and it was very quiet and peaceful.
8482,142,Great- so glad you loved it!!
8483,142,Beautiful setting! Love the historic feel right on the river. The deck overlooking the falls is absolutely gorgeous. Great for sitting out with a local brew and cheese and crackers! So nice to be able to walk around and enjoy a fire in the fire pit as well. The hot tub was so nice!
8484,142,It sounds like a perfect getaway!! Thank you for staying with us
8485,142,"Would love to come back. The house was a bit hard to find but someone contacted us immediately and gave us clear instructions on how to find the place. They stood with us on the phone until we were able to find it.

The inside of the house is decorated with old artifacts which I appreciated very much. Would be nice to see more history on the Mill but I understand this could be difficult considering the Mill was built so long ago.

The beautuful surroundings felt peaceful. We really enjoyed the coziness that the inside and outside provided. We spent our time indoors playing games and outdoors on the deck watching the beautiful falls. We also enjoyed walking around the premises. Nature at its best."
8486,142,We had an amazing time! The location was perfect and it was a wonderful getaway.
8487,142,Wonderful!! Thank you for staying with us!!
8488,142,Wow! This was exactly what we needed and wanted. Thank you so much for the amazing stay and hospitality!
8489,142,"Any review starting with ""Wow!"" Makes me pretty darn happy! So glad you loved your time at the Mill!"
8490,142,Beautiful location
8491,142,Thank you Rose! We look forward to having you back any time!
8492,142,Beautiful location and cabin. Can’t wait to return.
8493,142,<3 and we look forward to having you back!!! Thank you for staying with us!!
8494,142,"What a beautiful, unique and thoughtfully appointed place! Super comfortable and clean. Will definitely come back."
8495,142,"LOVE to see reviews like this, Danny-- thank you for sharing :-))) We look forward to having you back any time!"
8496,142,"Great stay, beautiful location, if back in the area will stay again. Highly recommend. 45 mins away from the race track in martinsville."
8497,142,Great place to stay! Very relaxing and was located close to the wedding venue. Plenty to see and do in the area as well.
8498,142,Thanks for staying with us Josie!!
8499,142,"rustic and beautiful, but more rustic than we thought it would be. we loved it. I wouldn't take anybody with impaired mobility there. and while we lived our stay we thought it a bit pricey for what it was"
8500,142,"Hi Mary, glad you enjoyed your stay- it truly is an historic gristmill built in 1881 with original floors, walls and beams which is a large part of what makes it so unique. For those with accessibility issues, the entry into the first floor does have a step up to get inside and the bathroom is on the first floor. Two bedrooms and bunk area are upstairs on 2nd floor. Thanks for noting this!"
8501,142,"This place was awesome. If you want to stay anywhere in the area book it, you wont regret it!"
8502,142,Thank you for staying with us!!
8503,142,This place was exactly as it was listed to be & more! So cozy and fun! Our kids enjoyed going with their Grandparents & we joined for some of the fun!
8504,142,It's a pretty amazing spot for making memories for kids and adults alike. So glad your family enjoyed your stay!
8505,142,We had a great time and enjoyed the stay.
8506,142,Thank you Bobby!!
8507,142,what a wonderful tranquil experience
8508,142,"Wonderful! We look forward to having you back, Ellen!"
8509,142,"Such a gorgeous place to stay!! We basically ended up having a staycation because quite honestly, The Mill is a destination in an of itself. We relaxed on the deck in front of the waterfall every morning for coffee, and enjoyed the hot tub almost nightly. We walked around the grounds and even did a workout in one of the small grassy areas. We were looking for a quiet and seclusive retreat and definitely got it.

The interior is decorated perfectly and authentically. I couldn’t get over how well the hosts used the natural structure/walls/floors to the advantage of the aesthetics. Beauty in the simplicity.

The large bedroom is facing the falls and it’s the only thing you hear at night. So relaxing!

The only downfall worth even mentioning, and only saying this for those who prefer soft/sink into mattress, the king bed was on the harder side and we ended up switching rooms to a bed that wasn’t so hard. So, if you like harder mattresses, you’re all set!

Also! We visited JOLO Vineyards and Midsummer Brewery and both are awesome! JOLO is definitely for the wine enthusiast and midsummer is just a fun place to bring dinner and drink good beer."
8510,142,<3 feelin pretty happy after reading this! Thank you for staying with us!! Look forward to hosting you again.
8511,142,"Uhm the star button is broken. I'd give 10 out of 5 🌟. Hehe. The setting is amazing so beautiful. It rained all weekend and we didnt even mind. Rain on the metal roof, the waterfall sounds, the comfort.... pure relaxation. We all dove into books, naps, played board games, and the hot tub. Kirchen is well supplied to cook. Just bring the groceries.

Only recommendation: add a framed printed sign with the building's history like corn, silk, parachutes, WW2, socks, etc"
8512,142,"We had the amazing experience of visiting this wonderful property. The highlight was the waterfall. The sound of it is a great stress reliever. We spent more time than we thought we would, just sitting on the deck with our own private waterfall, watching the heron fish and the deer grazing on the slope across the creek. A very relaxing place! Our hosts, Taylor and Dylan were quickly responsive to the few questions we had. We really enjoyed our time there. Thank you!"
8513,142,This charming mill was one of the best Airbnb’s we have found. It is exactly as described and the waterfall was such an amazing feature. We had such an amazing and restful weekend.
8514,142,<3 we look forward to your return!
8515,142,Amazing location! Beautiful property with so much to do and explore close by! You won't be disappointed! Can't wait to return!
8516,142,"So glad you loved it and were able to visit Danbury, kayak on the Dan River and visit our neighbor, Midsummer Brewing!!"
8517,142,Perfection! Our stay was more than we could have asked for and more! Even better in person!! Highly recommended!!
8518,142,So lovely to read reviews like these!! Thanks So much- please join again any time!
8519,142,The Mill is an absolute gem. We loved every minute we spent there. Our kids found such joy watching the waterfall and playing in the creek. The beds were cozy and comfortable and made us all feel like we were at home. We are all wanting to return as soon as we can!
8520,142,So glad your stay was a magical one!! We look forward to having you back any time!
8521,142,"What a wonderful place to create memories! We stayed here with my parents and our 5 year old boys. Everyone will remember this place for years to come.
It’s such a cute and unique spot to stay. The sound of the water is so delightful and relaxing. We would definitely stay here again."
8522,142,So glad you loved it!!! Please join us again any time!
8523,142,"Taylor and Dylans’ place is one of a kind. This was our second stay here, and I can say without a doubt, we will be back again in the future.

I could go on and on about the beauty and historical charm that it brings to the table, but the pictures and my ramblings still wouldn’t do it justice…

So… if you’ve come across this listing, and you’re taking the time to read this review, then trust me when I say, “book it already.” You won’t regret it!"
8524,142,"Awesome y'all!! Thanks for staying again, we are so happy that you love the mill like we do :-))"
8525,142,Our family of four really enjoyed our stay at this unique home! It was such fun to walk in and be wowed by the charm of the furnishings and the amazing sound of the falls just outside the back door. It was so peaceful and comfortable. We took advantage of the local tubing and did some hiking at Hanging Rock State Park. Thanks for helping us make some wonderful family memories at your place! We'd definitely recommend a stay!
8526,142,Thank you Rebecca!! Please join us again any time!
8527,142,"We absolutely loved the mill. Enjoyed the decor. Very comfy.
Spotted a couple of deer and a crane by the water. Wish we would have been staying longer to get the most of our experience. Maybe next time!"
8528,142,The wildlife sightings sound magical! So glad you enjoyed it
8529,142,"We had an incredible stay here!! The sounds and views of the falls is absolutely incredible. It was pretty hot during the day, but we tried to sit on the back porch every chance we could get. We highly recommend coming here and hope we will be back soon!!"
8530,142,Please join us again any time!
8531,142,Fun place with an amazing view! Very unique lodging to stay at.
8532,142,Glad you loved it!
8533,142,"Pros-
1. The water feature is amazing! By far our favorite part of this place. We spent the better part of one day playing in the water— highly recommend!

2. Place is very clean.

Cons-
1. When we arrived the air was set to 80 degrees— a requirement of the host upon departure is set the thermostat to 80. The place didn’t cool down until dark because our stay was during a heat wave.

2. Many of the string lights on the walkway are burnt out making night walks impossible.

3. Area around water had very long grass causing everyone in our group who went fishing to return with many chigger bites.

4. There are no locks on the bedroom doors.

5. There is a water pressure problem— the water goes from a slow trickle to a normal level every few seconds. This makes showering frustrating.

6. Hot tub had chunks of hair floating every time it was turned on.

7. There is a hole in the queen bedroom floor large enough to see the outside.

8. Both ground entry doors have large holes in the bottom where they don’t seal properly making it necessary to store all food in an airtight container. We did see a mouse bait station in the house.

9. We heard strange knocking sounds in the walls the first night and assumed it was other people in our party moving around. The next evening we saw bats coming out of the roofline. Given the holes in the bedroom floor and the exterior doors, we ended up leaving around 10pm as it did not feel safe to remain. The host compensated us for this night’s stay."
8534,142,"Hi Crystal, I'm sorry that the mill was not a good fit for you and your crew- the historic gristmill, while unique and beautiful, is certainly not a typical home.
After your concerns we had a professional inspector come out and confirm that there are, in fact, no bats on the property or evidence of them at any time. We also had a plumber check out the water pressure concern- thanks for the heads up on that! We hope you find a getaway that is a better fit for you on your next Airbnb stay!"
8535,142,We had a very enjoyable visit to Dylan & Taylor's beautifully renovated millhouse. The waterfall provides relaxing background noise and the home is well appointed and so comfortable. We will be back!
8536,142,"Our family had a wonderful weekend stay at the mill. We tubed down the dan river on Friday afternoon (General Dan's tubing), ate at Mi Casa in Mt. Airy Friday evening, and hiked to waterfall's in Hanging Rock State Park (highly recommend lower cascade falls) on Saturday. We spent the rest of our stay relaxing at the mill and enjoying the amazing sounds of the waterfall and nature. Highly recommend!"
8537,142,The Old Mill in Westfield is an amazing place to stay! I loved being there so much it was hard to tear myself away to do other things! I was perfectly happy to stay on the deck and watch the water and the huge blue heron who likes to have meals by the waterfall. Truly a beautiful spot in nature to have a home! What a treat to spend time in this lovely setting! Thank you for sharing!
8538,142,"We had been looking forward to this stay ever since the day we booked it, and it was so worth it! Right when we pulled up, we could hear& see the beautiful waterfall in the property and could tell that it was exactly what we had hoped! It was such a lovely place to stay with just the right amount of things to do in the surrounding towns and parks. 100% recommend!"
8539,142,Quiet and cozy! Easy access to Hanging Rock and Mt. Airy.
8540,142,This is an incredible space. So beautiful and relaxing and so well taken care of. We loved it! Thank you Taylor & Dylan for a wonderful anniversary trip! ♥️
8541,142,Wonderful Airbnb! Loved the house and the waterfall out back!
8542,142,"This was the most tranquil, peaceful Airbnb ever! We stayed 3 nights at the Mill and it was glorious. Sleeping to the sounds of the waterfall is something I won't soon forget. Taylor & Dylan did an amazing job making this place comfortable without taking away from the rustic charm. My son loved the foosball table, fishing and walking on the rocks. The steps to the bedrooms (upstairs) are a bit steep and the bathroom is downstairs.... other than that, it is literally perfect. We plan to stay again. Thank you Taylor & Dylan!"
8543,142,Nice place with a fantastic view.
8544,142,It is rare to find a listing with pictures that are truly accurate. Both my wife and I found the Mill to be beautiful and fit the description and pictures perfectly. The location gives you opportunities to travel in all four directions and find many things to do.
8545,142,"The Mill House has everything you would want in a quiet getaway. Bed was comfy, hot tub was clean and relaxing, and the space is gorgeous. Will definitely be back!"
8546,142,This place far exceeded our expectations…the photos don’t do it justice! Our family of 5 had a blast hanging out by the creek and relaxing in the hot tub after a day of hiking nearby at Hanging Rock State Park. I highly recommend this place!
8547,142,We loved it
8548,142,The place was like “home away from home” and was a great getaway to hear the running waterfall/being in a cozy environment.
8549,142,Wonderful views and super nice hiking locations.
8550,142,"We absolutely loved our stay at the Mill! The location is amazing and the Mill is gorgeous. From the moment you walk in, you are enveloped by the sound of water. It is one of the most relaxing retreats you can imagine. The house is superbly done - it's spacious and comfortable with a really cool combination of contemporary furniture and fixtures mixed with great antiques and art. As for the glassed-in deck, it's hard to pull yourself away from that space and view. Communication with Taylor and Dylan was excellent. The area where the mill is located is beautiful countryside - nice driving and great hiking trails at Hanging Rock State Park. I highly recommend and look forward to a return visit!"
8551,142,Lovely setting with the waterfall behind the house. Well stocked kitchen and space. Enjoyed the fabulous hiking close at hand.
8552,142,"The Mill Cabin was a great weekend getaway for my wife and me. The waterfall right outside the cabin was so pretty and relaxing. We truly had a great time.

We def will be back"
8553,143,Great place to come back to after spending the day at the beach
8554,143,"Wonderful location in the middle of it all. Very clean and comfortable. Tommy is super quick to respond to communications. Bath and beach towels, bed linens, paper products, trash bags all provided. So nice not to worry about bringing those items."
8555,143,This stay is AMAZING! The host is awesome and answers any questions you may have. The beds were so comfortable I had to look at the mattress to maybe get one myself haha.
8556,143,Perfect cottage two blocks from the beach! Spacious and well decorated. We will definitely book again.
8557,143,"Booked the day of for a last minute weekend getaway and Tommy was very quick to respond. It was the perfect place for me to take my dog with me to the beach. Super convenient location, easy walk to the beach as well as places to get something to eat!"
8558,143,"This home is a gem. A short walk to the beach, coffee shop, and restaurants. It’s beautiful and clean on the inside. We felt so at home ❤️"
8559,143,Very nice place to stay! Everything was clean and the beds were really comfortable!
8560,143,"It’s a great place, easy to get to the beach and a great view from the backyard."
8561,143,"It was our first stay in Surf City and we’ll be back. Tommy was a very responsive host and communicated promptly to make sure everything went well for our family. The location was great, close to the beach and walking distance to restaurants and shops in Surf City. Perfect place for my family of 4 plus our dog. I think our dog may have liked the front porch with latched gate more than us. Thanks for the memorable stay!"
8562,143,"This is a great house to crash for the night or if you plan on spending your days at the beach. It’s nicely decorated in nautical style. It’s a small, older house, but it has nice updates. It is located on a busy road, but it’s across the street from the beach, which is awesome. Tommy is a great host. We had a nice stay."
8563,143,"Great location, clean, Tommy is an awesome host."
8564,143,"My husband and I and our 2 dogs enjoyed our weekend stay in this cute beach cottage! The house was very clean and well stocked. We appreciate Tommy being so quick to respond to our messages/questions before our trip to Topsail. He is most definitely an excellent, considerate host."
8565,143,"This house was perfect for us. We wanted to be walking distance from the center of town and it doesn’t get much better than this. The house was clean, spacious, and had everything we needed for our weekend stay in Surf City."
8566,143,"Cottage is clean, set up to accommodate three couples easily with three separate rooms. We stayed two nights and explored Surf City & Topsail Beach. There’s so much to do! We enjoyed a sunrise walk on the beach! It’s easy to get around town walking and bicycle riding! There’s parks & boardwalks and plenty of restaurants to enjoy. We also found pickle ball courts in Topsail Beach town center. Tommy is a great host and responds quickly."
8567,143,Really nice place.
8568,143,Our stay was great! Location and Weather was awesome. Tommy was prompt with communication. Station 503 was just as described. Well stocked and very clean. Will be planning another stay soon!
8569,143,Station 503 was perfect for our little weekend stay for Ocean Fest! We were able to walk to all of the festivities and the beach access is two blocks away. The house looked exactly as it did in the photos was super cute. Tommy was incredibly communicative and accommodating. We’re already talking about staying here again for Ocean Fest next year!
8570,143,The perfect spot for a beach getaway! It was a convenient location as it was a quick walk to the beach and plenty of room for a family trip. We hope to be back soon.
8571,143,"This place was exceptional for our family (with two small children and dog)! Tommy was very prompt to reply during the booking process and all the way through. The location is perfect! Very short walk to the beach and close to shopping, food, and fun. We enjoyed the large covered porch when not on the beach. The home is adorable, very clean and had everything you needed to cook, laundry access, and the beds were very comfy. This was our first trip to Surf City and it did not dissapoint. We can't wait to return and will definitely be choosing 503 again! Thanks, Tommy!"
8572,143,Enjoyed my stay. Amazing sunsets from the backyard and short walk to the beach. Tommy was accommodating and even offered me early check in.
8573,143,"I booked this house last minute because I had a change in work schedule that allowed me to attend a retirement ceremony. The deal was too good to pass up, the location was perfect and the host, Tommy, was very accommodating on such short notice.

The house is just off the bridge which makes travel on and off the island very convenient. The restaurants and coffee shops were about a half mile down the road and easy to get to. And the best part, it’s only a block to the beach. It was great to leave the car and walk everywhere.

The weather was great and I had other things to do, so I spent most of my time outside of the house. But the kitchen was stocked with utensils, the towels were clean and folded and the beds were clean and made. Not much else to ask for.

One thing I noticed that was super convenient was the hose to spray yourself down on the front sidewalk.

They say “location, location, location” and this place has it in spades. Enjoy your stay."
8574,143,Very neat clean. Would go back anytime. Tommy's a very responsive host
8575,143,Great place and great communication from host.
8576,143,Great spot close to the beach (a couple minute walk with kids in tow). Tommy was quick to respond and kindly addressed my suggestions and concerns 👍
8577,143,Overall great stay. Super convenient! Good place to crash at but not necessarily a beach “get away”.
8578,143,The place was great. We ran into a couple minor issues that Tommy was quick to address. Overall we were pleased with the stay and would stay again.
8579,143,"The location is amazing, short walk from the beach, there are cute shops and restaurants near by that you can go to aswell. The place was nice and homey and the pull out beds allow for adequate space for a group to sleep at. Tommy was very communicative and understanding of any questions we had for him. I’m sure you’ll enjoy your stay at this listing! (:"
8580,143,"Awesome home to stay in, literally a 3 min walk to the beach! Host is super responsive and provided linens & towels! We were able to cook all week for the family, perfect set up for our family of 8!"
8581,143,Absolutely wonderful! Tommy is super accommodating and makes sure you are taken care of. Loved the space and everything in it. Truly a 60 second walk to the beach which is amazing!
8582,143,"Perfectly located. Easy access to the beach and very close to restaurants, shops, and a small grocery store. Everything needed to cook and relax after a day at the beach was included. The setup is very well thought out. A hose out front is setup to help clean the sand off of beach gear and sandy feet. The laundry let’s you keep up with the dirty clothes. Tommy was an excellent and responsive host. Highly recommend!"
8583,143,"Our gang-- 2 moms, 3 kids & 1 grandma--really enjoyed our stay at this very clean & comfortable old bungalow! We had plenty of hot water, a/c & restful beds, & a very short walk to the beach. We met locals & tourists alike at little bustling Surf City, a few blocks away--good memories for years to come!"
8584,143,Short walk to the beach and restaurants…can’t beat it. The house was super cozy and the hosts communicated with us really well. If you want a little getaway to spend some time by the water this is definitely the spot.
8585,143,We really enjoyed our girls trip! The house was well stocked with everything we needed and it was easy to get to the beach with small children. Everything was clean and decorated beautifully! Close to stores and restaurants. We hope to return again soon!
8586,143,Love this place and will definitely be back! They’ve thought of everything and this place is such a fun little hangout with such a short walk to the beach. Highly recommend spending time here!
8587,143,Great spot nice quiet place would highly recommend..Tommy and mike were great with communicating.. definitely will book again me and my family had a great time..
8588,143,We enjoyed the ease of getting to the beach quickly and the convenient access to all the areas near by.
8589,143,"Great place for a vacation. The pictures are accurate and it’s just a block away from walking on the sand. It’s walking distance to the bridge, to get some ice cream, and even close enough to walk to the grocery store to buy those last minute items that you forgot. I highly recommend you give this spot a chance. We will be visiting again."
8590,143,"Very amazing place right by everything you need to have a great time! Tommy and his hospitality was phenomenal and very professional! And I will definitely be back!
Very clean, neat looks just like the pictures and you get everything from what it’s worth! Thank you Tommy for being amazing host"
8591,144,"I cannot say enough good things about our stay and this absolutely beautiful cabin. Gene and Connie were so kind, generous and friendly. They have thought of every single thing you could possibly want and have ensured it is provided. There were so many thoughtful touches in- and outside the cabin, which itself is just so well-made and beautifully appointed. I’m not sure what my favorite part was but the outdoor shower was pretty amazing. We will definitely be back. Outstanding place."
8592,144,I am not going to tell anyone about how truly magical this stay was. I refuse to tell anyone how perfect and serene the property is or how detailed and inviting the home. No one needs to know the escape and release you experience in this special place. I am not going to tell anyone so we can keep it all to ourselves. 100 out of 5 stars!
8593,144,"Gene and Connie were wonderful host.
They really went out of their way to make the honeymoon special. The cabin was so beautiful and private"
8594,144,"This is a dream come true to be in a property that can make you smile from the day you arrive till the day you leave. We are looking forward to our next visit.
Amazing property!"
8595,144,"We enjoyed our stay, so nice and peaceful. Kids had a blast, we loved it. Definitely will be back again. Gene and Connie had everything we needed for our stay, they stop down at the cabin and offered if we needed anything else during our stay. We will be back. Thank you for everything we enjoyed our time at you’re beautiful cabin."
8596,144,"Charming, quaint, and private cabin with unique touches that made the whole experience feel spectacular and beyond anything we have experienced on a get away before. Hosts offered the best of Southern hospitality and friendliness, offering the perfect recommendations to enjoy. I would highly recommend. A true gem from the beauty of the property to the warm and friendly hosts. We will definitely be back!"
8597,144,A great cozy cabin with many nice personal touches. Private with lots of outdoor area which our dog loved. Will definitely stay there again.
8598,144,"Such wonderful and accomodating hosts! This place is beautiful, homey and versatile. I only admired the bathroom about 100 times during my stay. Complimentary snacks, drinks and farm fresh eggs from their home were thoughtful and perfect extras. Made a forever memory at this cabin when my now fiance proposed...and I definitely hope to come back!"
8599,144,Beautiful and comfortable cabin — perfect place for my staycation. Highly recommended!
8600,144,"Amazing spot, a hidden gem indeed. Would definitely return whenever I'm in the area. Would recommend for a relaxing weekend."
8601,144,Charming rustic cabin done to a very high standard. Very private & quiet location. Gene & Connie are very generous and attentive hosts. Next time we'll hopefully have time to enjoy the outdoor fire pit.
8602,144,"Beyond expectations, comfortable pet friendly peaceful cabin and great hosts! Would definitely recommend!"
8603,144,"We had a wonderful stay at Gene and Connie's Cabin. Very nice and cozy. It was too cold to take advantage of the outdoor amenities but we loved cuddling up on the couch with a roaring fire and a glass of wine. I would definitely stay again.
Thanks Gene and Connie!"
8604,144,Nice! having about nice having the firewood already in the house for us. it's on the back of their property in edge of the woods. We felt very safe. only wish we had more time to spend a couple of days doing nothing. plenty inside the house for two or three evenings.
8605,144,"This farmhouse cabin is truly a luxurious romantic getaway retreat! Gene and Connie go above and beyond to accommodate the space with all the things you would have at home and then some. The kitchen is fully equipped to cook and dine in. The cabin has a beautiful outdoor fire pit but we chose to use the gorgeous stone fireplace inside which filled the cabin with such a warm ambiance—we could even enjoy the fire from the sleeping loft above. The furnishings and decor were very tasteful and charming, down to the quaint claw foot tub in the bathroom. Luxurious linens and towels and first class amenities all around were provided—so far beyond our expectations and far better than any airbnb we have stayed!!"
8606,144,"This is a marvelous little cottage! It is the perfect size for two people, and Gene and Connie have gone above and beyond to include a bunch of thoughtful extras that make the stay perfect. They were very responsive, and did an amazing job of taking care of us! We will definitely be staying here again, and I highly recommend it!"
8607,144,Such a picturesque and cozy cabin. It exceeded all of our expectations and we will definitely rebook and come back to stay here again!
8608,144,"The cabin was so great! A perfect place to stay and relax. Gene and Connie are wonderful hosts! Very very very accommodating. The cabin had everything you could really need for a great stay. If you are looking for a quiet get away, this cabin is an incredible option. You will not be disappointed. The location is close to downtown Lexington and to some great wineries.
Run, don’t walk, to book time here!"
8609,144,Gene and Connie are wonderful hosts! It’s the little things they did that made the stay that much better. Perfect cozy cabin for time away with your loved ones! We will definitely come back to stay an visit!:)
8610,144,Hosts are super nice and understanding. I highly recommend this stay. It was nothing short of amazing. Super clean and had everything we needed.
8611,144,We loved this quaint cabin! It was perfect for getting cozy and enjoying the peace and quiet. Everything was clean and the place was stocked with anything that we might need. Thoroughly enjoyed our weekend there!
8612,144,Wonderful place to stay! Very clean and comfortable!! Loved everything about our stay!
8613,144,"Overall an amazing stay, hosts went above and beyond what other hosts usually do
Appreciated every additional item they added for us. Waking up early to sit on the porch for the sunrise and watching deer roam the woods, and being able to set the fire up at night with a clear view of the skies was perfect! I’ve already recommended this to a friend and will definitely be coming to this place again if I’m ever traveling around the area"
8614,144,"An absolutely perfect country getaway for 1 or 2 (and a bark bark)! Super clean, wonderfully comfy, thoughtful touches, INCREDIBLE hosts, convenient to wineries/downtown Lexington, covered outdoor cooking area, massive fire pit and off leash dog privileges!! This place is new to AirBNB, but will be reserved up through 2023 in no time. Book it while you can! Did I mention how kind and generous the hosts are? Twelve thumbs up!"
8615,144,What is beautiful place! Very private and lots of space to take in the nature. The bathroom was amazing for soaking and everything I needed was there. Lots of personal touches to make it perfect.
8616,145,"The house was quiet and peaceful. It was a great place to relax after a day exploring Wilmington. Cindy was helpful, friendly, and quick to respond."
8617,145,"Cindy is a great host!!! She made our family feel VERY welcome! She was super helpful from the day we booked and throughout our stay. The location was perfect for everything we had planned from the beach to the attractions.

The bungalow is a nice little place in Wilmington that is so worth staying in!

If we stay in the area again we plan on contacting Cindy again!"
8618,145,"We LOVED hosting you and your family, Eddie. Thank you for being such incredible guests."
8619,145,"Excellent communication from Cindy, great location conveniently located short ride to all. I would definitely stay there again."
8620,145,"We enjoyed hosting you, Anthony. You were a wonderful guest and we loved hosting you. Come back soon!"
8621,145,"Employees always request to stay at this home, while working in the area."
8622,145,We love having you all and appreciate your employees taking such great care of our home!
8623,145,Great stay here. we've stayed multiple times. never disappointed.
8624,145,We love having you all! Come back soon!
8625,145,Absolutely loved it! Cindy is an amazing host!
8626,145,every time I've stayed here they reach out before I get the chance to. super helpful and attentive always.
8627,145,Beautiful clean home!
8628,145,Another great stay! Thank you!
8629,145,Beautiful clean home!
8630,145,Cindy was absolutely pleasant. Responsive in a timely manner. Great Location felt like a home away from home. Great neighborhood.
8631,145,We enjoyed our stay!
8632,145,A beautiful place to stay with everything our family needed. Cindy and Ed are great hosts!
8633,145,Great place to stay.
8634,145,"Cindy's bungalow is very clean and cozy. Communication with the host was excellent! We found the beds very comfortable and the kitchen is well stocked. It's located on a pretty busy road, but Cindy provides fans and white noise machines so we were able to sleep well. There's a huge backyard that's fenced in and it has lots of nice places to sit and relax outside. The pool looks awesome -- we'd love to return when it's warm enough to enjoy it!"
8635,145,Loved this house! Clean and cozy with a big backyard and pool. Everything was great!
8636,145,Cindy is very friendly and helpful! very quick at respondingand ready to help however she could with a y questionand concerns we had! Great with recommendations as well. had a great stay at their home.
8637,145,Perfect for our family weekend away. Good location for all we wanted to do. Beautiful pool and back yard!
8638,145,"Cindy’s bungalow was a great stay for us while visiting in the Wilmington area for employment! The listing was accurate, and Cindy was professional, and provides exceptional customer service! Highly recommended when in the area."
8639,145,House was as described. Beds were surprisingly comfortable compared to a lot of other stays I’ve in places so that was a great treat. Communication was really nice and quick responses. Would definitely stay again.
8640,145,"Perfect house in a quiet area for our small family to stay while visiting for a wedding. Cindy was amazing as a host, she took personal care to ensure we had a comfortable stay. House has everything you need for a visit. Highly recommend and we would stay again."
8641,145,"The house was clean and all the amenities were as describe. Cindy was really quick at responding. The location is really close to everything, and is only 15 mins away from Wrightville beach. The beds were very comfortable. I highly recommended for anyone who is looking for a relaxing vacation!"
8642,145,"We have stayed at Cindy's several times now. It is the perfect spot for our little family to get away from it all, and enjoy time together. We come here to enjoy the pool in the backyard, make s'mores, and head to the beach (about 10-15 minutes away). Wonderful spot when you have kids and don't always want to make the trek out on the beach, you can still enjoy time outside.

This last time we went for a long weekend when my kid had a teacher workday! It was nice to unplug, and I spent most of the time on the lounger in the backyard reading a book while they enjoyed the pool. Can't wait to come back again!"
8643,145,"We loved our stay the the bungalow! It was the perfect long weekend getaway place. The backyard area with the pool, firepit and cornhole made for a great relaxing day without going out. The house is also a short drive to the beach and lots of cute shops and restaurants. All of these things make it possible to do it all, even if your stay is only a few days. Cindy was a wonderful hostess! The house was very clean and well kept. The instructions for check in and house details are simple and spot on and she replied to all of our additional questions about the area very quickly. We are thankful to her for the amazing stay we had in Wilmington."
8644,145,Cindy is an excellent host and very responsive to any questions you may have. The house was super clean and comfortable. The outside space was so nice to hang with the family! Huge yard with a nice pool! We would stay here again.
8645,145,"Cindy was very warm, friendly, responsive, and helpful. Her activity and food recommendations were spot on. The house was the perfect size for us and had everything a family of four with a 2 year old and 3 year old could need. We loved the beautiful private pool with huge, fenced in backyard in a quiet, friendly neighborhood.

Cindy has a huge selection of pool floats and pool toys. Also loved her outdoor canopy bed. We loved snuggling up on it at night and stargazing. My two year old and I found many cuddle opportunities in the beautiful wicker rocking chair by the pool. Cindy also has an amazing selection of board games and books for kids and adults to enjoy on rainy days.

I will admit I was a little anxious about safety and how my little ones would do around the pool (and how to keep them from sneaking off to the pool without my knowledge). I was so relieved because my fears were unfounded. The sliding glass door leading to the pool is too difficult for a small child to open on their own and there is another lock too just in case. And the huge fenced in backyard made it possible for this mama to relax! Loved rocking in the wicker rocking chair by the pool with my little one.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the bungalow and highly recommend Cindy’s place! Hope to be back next year!"
8646,145,"This charming bungalow was perfect for our stay in Wilmington. Everything is just as described. We especially loved that the pool is huge and the beds are super comfortable. The location was perfect too, central to everything. Our hostess was extremely communicative and thoughtful, dropping off coffee creamer, s’mores, and wood for the fire pit. Would definitely stay here again on our next visit to Wilmington!"
8647,145,The Bungalow was absolutely wonderful! Cindy was an excellent host and responded quickly to any and all questions that I had. The house was adorable and had everything you needed for a great trip. We hope to return in thr future!
8648,145,Great location and great host!
8649,145,"We enjoyed the salt water pool and comfortable beds. Kitchen is original to the home, and could use updates to make it feel fresh. The home was close to the beach."
8650,145,"Thanks for your input, Chloe! The value in our home is in the PRIVATE saltwater pool, location, and charm. The house is priced as such! One day we will gut the house and have all new everything - but the price you paid was for the house as advertised. Glad you enjoyed the pool and our very comfy 800 square foot home!"
8651,145,"We had a great stay here! House is in a great location, and very homey! It filled all of our needs with no disappointments! Pool was fantastic and necessary with the heat! Cindy’s communication was exemplary! We would love to come back!"
8652,145,Great family spot! Convenient to beach and anything else you need. Pool was a major plus!
8653,145,"Our family of four had the best vacation at the Bungalow! Again! This was our second stay in two years, and both visits were fun, relaxing, and the most and best quality family time together! The Bungalow is clean and cozy, the backyard is spacious and private, and the pool is large and so much fun! We swam every day! When it would storm, we watched movies and played board games inside (some provided by the hosts!). Having the convenience of a private pool right in the backyard was the best - we could go in and out and take breaks from swimming very easily. It was an easy drive to Wrightsville Beach, and there are many shopping and restaurant options nearby. Cindy and Ed provided all the information we needed and communication was always very quick; they have shown such kindness to us, and we are so thankful!"
8654,145,"This bungalow was perfect for a week in town for business. My husband and 9yr old joined me, and the accommodations were perfect for our needs. The pool is larger than in the photos. Very close to Wrightsville beach. Everything was super clean, comfortable, and well suited to our needs. I especially appreciated all the help Cindy our hostess provided. Absolutely recommend to families and business travelers!"
8655,145,"We had an AMAZING Week. The house is Perfect size.. Cute and Conveniently Located to everything but also has privacy. We enjoyed the Pool as it is Relaxing and the Back Yard is Big..
Great communication between Cindy and the Extra Efforts & Touches that were made before arrival were So Sweet and Unexpected 😊
Can’t wait to go back and WILL DEFINITELY stay AGAIN!!! ❣️"
8656,145,"Great home, great hosts! The location is wonderful. It’s a quiet neighborhood with a private space. The pool was amazing. The house was so accommodating, it had everything we needed, and then some. The hosts are so personable and we enjoyed everything about our stay."
8657,145,"The hosts were great with any questions and concerns we had. They went above & beyond to make sure we were happy with our stay. I would book with them again because of their level of care for their guests. The house was very clean, the pool was great, and location was great for our vacation needs. Super close to all areas of Wilmington, as well as Wrightsville, Carolina & Kure Beach."
8658,145,We had a great time at the Airbnb. Perfect for pool days and a relaxing weekend. The house was very clean and cute. The hosts were extremely welcoming and helpful. Will definitely be back!
8659,145,Cindy was a great host and easy to communicate with. The house was even more adorable than in the pictures and the yard is truly a private oasis. The property is also conveniently located to everything a family would need. Thanks again for a wonderful stay.
8660,145,Thank you so much. We loved hosting you all!!
8661,145,"The pool is amazing! They had pool accessories in the garage that made it so special! The location is great as well, you will not be disappointed."
8662,145,"Cindy was an amazing host!! I will definitely be coming back. The bungalow was so adorable, it was comfortable and beautiful. The backyard lounge chairs and day bed were amazing by the pool and is where my fiancé and I spent most of our time. Thank you again, Cindy for being so attentive!"
8663,145,"House was as described, we unfortunately didn’t get to use the pool because of the weather but it was clean and would definitely had taken advantage of it if the weather had cooperated! Location is very central to everything, only 15 minutes out to Wrightsville Beach."
8664,145,"This house is so homey, Cindy and Ed are great host! They always communicated in a timely manner, met all of our needs and more. We loved the pool and fire pit! Had plenty of space for our 1 year old to play and enjoy herself as well! Wish we could’ve stayed longer!"
8665,145,The bungalow is exactly as described and Cindy was very helpful with any questions we had and the little notes on the tables to welcome us along with the fresh flowers was amazing !
8666,145,"Very nice, clean property. Beds and linens were very comfortable. The only thing I would say is to bring your own towels if more than 2 people. As a family of four, we ran out of bathroom towels/washcloths quickly."
8667,145,Hi Elizabeth! We loved having you all. Thank you for being such a kind guest. I apologize about the towels. We normally have plenty of towels at the pool house. We had a guest take some by accident. We have replaced them.
8668,145,"Everything was PERFECT for our family! Great location, close to stores/restaurants but not too busy! Cindy was amazing and available when we needed her! Can’t wait for our next stay with Cindy!"
8669,145,We loved staying at the Bungalow! No complaints.
8670,145,"Great location, wonderful hosts and personal touches to make your stay easy and enjoyable! Host went above and beyond to provide personal suggestions and services! Great experience for our family’s first time in Wilmington!"
8671,145,"This was a last minute find- and a gem. This property is immaculately maintained and beyond the basics were included- including coffee and coffee filters (an essential for this coffee addict). All questions were responded to timely and Cindy was a gracious host. If I get the chance to go back and stay, I will be doing so!"
8672,145,"This was a wonderful space to getaway for our little family. Great location in town, and about 15 minutes to Wrightsville. The pool is perfect for the days when going to the beach feels like a chore."
8673,145,Great little house for a home away from home.
8674,145,Cute bungalow close to beaches and lots of shopping! Quiet street away from all the hustle and bustle. Host was very attentive to our needs with great communication. The backyard was relaxing with the pool. We enjoyed our stay!
8675,145,Cindy’s place was super cozy and had a wonderful backyard space! Great location close to many restaurants and about a 30 minute drive to the ocean. We wished we could’ve stayed longer!
8676,145,"We really enjoyed our stay at this cute guesthouse! It was clean and cozy, and it was a short drive to the beach, restaurants, coffee shops and grocery store. The backyard was a nice place to sit in the sun during the day and build a fire in the fire pit in the evening. We also enjoyed going for walks in the quiet and friendly neighborhood."
8677,145,Everything was perfect! Cindy and her family were great host.
8678,145,"Very clean, cute decor, and exactly what we needed for a very fair price. Thank you!"
8679,145,"We loved staying at Cindy’s bungalow. She was super responsive, the house was very clean and she supplied every day supplies like shampoo, conditioner, laundry detergent, dish soap and paper products. I plan to stay again when in the area!"
8680,145,Wonderfully clean and nice place to stay. Everything you need is close by. Beds are very comfortable…a relaxing weekend. Great communication.
8681,145,Cindy's place was wonderful. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will definitely come again.
8682,145,"The bungalow was even better in person. Great location, decor, and over all great experience ! We highly recommend you stay !"
8683,145,"The home is cozy in a great location, close to shopping & restaurants, and a quick drive to Wrightsville beach or alternatively the riverfront.

The property is large and we would love to come back when it is warmer to make use of the pool with the kids. Cindy was welcoming and easy to communicate with, great qualities in a host."
8684,145,"The bungalow was excellent. Great location in Wilmington with short drives to everything from groceries to beaches. Sitting out back was relaxing by the pool and the yard was still big for the kids to play.

The house was very comfortable and had everything you need away from home. We would absolutely stay again. Cindy and her husband were very quick to answer our questions and showed up in minutes with extra remote batteries for the Roku TV’s."
8685,145,Great place to stay
8686,145,House was perfect! Cindy was a fantastic host. It’s a Great location close to everything
8687,145,Great place! The pool is bigger than what pictures show. It’s a cozy house. We will definitely recommend and go back.
8688,145,"We had a wonderful time at the bungalow! It's clean, convenient to just about anything you could need, and the backyard/pool/fire pit area is amazing. On top of that, Cindy was excellent with communication and made us feel very welcomed. 10/10 would recommend!"
8689,145,"Super cute, comfortable and incredibly clean. Great location if you want to go to downtown Wilmington (we loved the farmers market and TheArtworks art village for early holiday shopping from local artists, makers and vendors) and Wrightsville Beach. We also loved the live music at Ceviche’s Rum Bar on Friday night - a short drive from the house. Cindy is a wonderful host!"
8690,145,"Cute, clean with a huge pool and backyard. Cindy was very responsive. There was plenty of seating, and surprisingly there was coffee, sugar and creamer which is a huge plus! 🙂"
8691,145,It was a nice little escape that we needed. wish we could've stayed longer.
8692,145,Cindy’s cosy little bungalow was exactly what we needed! Relaxing by the poolside was just what the doctor ordered. Conveniently located near the beach! 10/10 would visit again!!
8693,145,"This is a great place for a fun and relaxing vacation. The house was clean and cozy with all the amenities to make for a comfortable stay. The pool was a highlight. We spent most of our time there, relaxing on the lounge chairs and floating on rafts to cool off. (We brought our own) The house is close to a grocery store and several places to eat. It's 15 - 20 minutes from downtown Wilmington and Wrightsville beach. Ogden Park is close by and is a great place to take a walk."
8694,145,"What a perfect stay! My niece had so much fun with the pool it was hard to get her to leave to go anywhere else. We cooked out on the grill and made most of our meals at home in the well equipped kitchen. Centrally located between all that Wilmington has to offer, I cant recommend this adorable, comfortable bungalow enough. Thanks for everything Cindy, we had a blast!"
8695,145,We loved hosting you and your family and hope you come back again next year. Cindy
8696,145,Great last minute stay and close the beaches
8697,145,We loved having you all< Gregory. You all were so kind to host.
8698,145,"Cindy and Ed were warm and welcoming hosts with a beautiful home. Everything was clean and inviting. We had everything we needed for our week stay.

The house is in perfect proximity to area beaches and attractions, while still being in a quiet neighborhood. The perfect getaway for our family."
8699,145,We loved having you and your family. You are delightful people and guests and we hope you com back soon.
8700,145,Wonderful place and stay! The hosts are very accommodating and great with communicating. The place is super cute and doesn’t feel as small as described. The pool and huge backyard are really nice. Just wish we could’ve controlled the rain and enjoyed the outdoors more. :)
8701,145,Our stay at cozy pool-side bungalow was fun and relaxing. The pool was the attraction for the two boys who spent most of their day swimming and playing pool games while Mom and GG read and talked poolside. The bungalow is a perfect size for four people and Cindy was very responsive to all questions we sent her. We will definitely be back in the future.
8702,145,"Our family had the very BEST vacation in the Bungalow! We live 10 hours away; it was worth the drive and we would absolutely visit again. The details and description of the house were accurate and helpful. The house was very clean and comfortable for our family of four, plus had such nice decorative touches. It also had convenient items like a Roku, coffee, towels, pool floats, and a charcoal grill. Publix was very close, plus there were lots of restaurant options nearby. The drive to the beach was not at all inconvenient, and we enjoyed our time there, but the kids preferred the pool. The yard is spacious and private and we had the best time swimming and spending the most quality time together for a week. We searched all over Airbnb for a nice, clean house with a private pool and began our search in Delaware, and couldn’t find anything as perfect as this Bungalow. Cindy was kind and helpful (and quick!) with communication and answering our questions. We couldn’t recommend the Bungalow more!"
8703,146,"We had a wonderful weekend getaway. We enjoyed fishing, boating & sitting on the porch. An adorable cabin!"
8704,146,Thank you fir the great review! Please do return
8705,146,"The was a quaint little cabin by the lake, just as described. Fully stocked with most anything one may need. Or trip had to be cut short due to the exteme cold, the heat wasnt able to keep us warm and the water pipes frozen the next morning. I contacted Shane and Air BNB and they were quick to respond. They were very kind a provided a full refund for our stay. Our issues were merely weather related that none of us had any control over. We greatly appreciate that we did not lose all our money on a trip we had to abandon. Our Christmas would have been just so perfect if the weather had been better. We will try to return to vacation there in warmer month's for sure, its a lovely place right on the lake. Thanks Shane"
8706,146,"Such a beautiful, & quiet setting! The house was very clean & comfortable! We enjoyed sitting down by the water around a fire, walks on the trail in the woods, early mornings & sunsets on the porch while looking out at the lake watching birds, ducks & geese coming and going. The wood stove was a perfect touch (we bought wood from a local place not far away)."
8707,146,"This house is decorated so sweet with little homey touches in every room it feels like a hug when you enter the room.

Beautiful view of the lake from the wrap around porches. A great place to take a breath and reflect on your many blessings."
8708,146,Thank you so much! It was a pleasure to host you and Henry!
8709,146,C
8710,146,"Penny thank you so much for your stay! For some reason your public post did not come through visibly so I am sharing it… Thank you again..

Shane, What a great place! We had two wonderful days playing in the water. Having all the different boats was awesome. I even watched a pair of otters. So glad we found your rental property. Thank you! Penny"
8711,146,Beautiful house and landscape. Very clean and cozy. We had fun all night on the porch and the dock. Super private and all around good time. Like 15 minutes top to city yet so remote. Looking foward to going again.
8712,146,"Thank you
Thank you
Thank you!"
8713,146,Great time at the cabin! Very clean and comfortable.
8714,146,"Shane's place is so cozy and peaceful! It was raining our whole trip, but we lit a fire and snuggled in. Look forward to coming back sometime when we can enjoy the lake and the boats more."
8715,146,Great place had a blast on the water!
8716,146,Thank you Adam!
8717,146,Adorable little lake house. Peaceful. Great view. The house has most items you may need for your visit. Check out instructions were simple. Easy to find as long as you follow the directions given. Ducks visiting every morning was a bonus for us! We own ducks so it felt like we were at home. Enjoyed our visit.
8718,146,"A lovely, quiet and clean place. Beautiful view of the lake."
8719,146,Shane is a great host! Many of our questions/communications were responded to in a matter of minutes. The cabin is a very restful place. Right on the banks of the lake. Take a kayak ride or use the canoe. We had frequent visitors (4 ducks) that greeted us every day. The town of Roxboro has some great restaurants. Not too far from Durham/Raleigh. Very close to VIR raceway. Really loved the lake.
8720,146,If you’re looking for a secluded relaxing spot on the lake you found it. We had a nice time but wish the town had more to offer. The kayaks and canoe available were a great addition to take out on the lake.
8721,146,"Lovely lake cabin, perfect for a couple or small family. Just loved the provided watercraft and all the amenities that were provided (kitchen staples, emergency shampoo/cond, bug spray, etc. And the neighborhood ducks were great amusement to our kids. Just a little slice of lake living in a Beautiful setting."
8722,146,"We thoroughly enjoyed our time at Shane's lake cabin. The view was gorgeous and it was so nice to have access to the kayaks, canoe and waterslide. The neighbors ducks greeted us when we arrived and so goodbye when we left... the kids loved it. The perfect little getaway!

Shane was easy to communicate with and so helpful. We will definitely be coming back!"
8723,146,"Wonderful place - great swimming, secluded, great communication from host."
8724,146,Great stay.
8725,146,Third year staying at Shane's and we already cannot wait to get back! Great place and host.
8726,146,"Great host and property, the location is very dreamy! A few missing amenities compared to the listing (grill, electricity on the porch, pedal boat) but we really enjoyed our stay. Shane was very responsive and willing to help. Very relaxing!"
8727,146,Thank you for your reservation and review. It is listed no grill supplied on listing (previous guest caused damage) and in every check in instructions prior to check in. There is full electricity on the porch - apparently you had tripped a breaker and lastly the paddle boat is there and unfully functionable. Thank you for the compliments I try very hard to make every guest my number one priority
8728,146,We had a great time! The lake is gorgeous. The cabin is great. It was the relaxing vacation we were looking for. Wifi worked well. We definitely want to come back again.
8729,146,"Really enjoyed our stay! The location was great, nice and quiet."
8730,146,"We had the best time at Shane’s lake house!! Took the dogs and our kayaks for a weekend getaway. We felt truly unplugged and far away from the city. Shane was an awesome host, and we look forward to our next stay!"
8731,146,"I booked this spot for fishing and it was a pleasure getting out on the lake with all of the water crafts they have available. The location is super quiet and even more lovely than the photos depict. Shane was quick to respond and gave very clear directions. Also, it was awesome having an Alexa for any music needs! I highly recommend this location and would love to come back and explore the lake more, it's much larger than imagined! One of my dogs fell ill while we were there but we found a wonderful vet nearby. I highly recommend Woodsdale Animal Hospital if anyone has need of their services while in the area. Despite the sick doggo, we had a wonderful time and would happily return!"
8732,146,Shane was an awesome host. The house and the view were great. I would highly recommend this place.
8733,146,"Reviews for properties like this are so easy. Shane has done everything that a great Airbnb host can do to make a stay enjoyable. Hosts like Shane are a prime reason we continue to use Airbnb as our favorite destination source.

The cabin is exactly as described in the listing and therefore there were no surprises. Shane was very quick to respond to the few questions we had, which we appreciated greatly. Mayo Lake is beautiful and the view from the wrap-around deck was great. Our visit was short so we didn't have a lot of time on the lake but I did catch a few fish and lake access for launching a small boat was great.

Shane's Water Front Lake House on Mayo Lake is certainly on our list for return visits."
8734,146,Perfect little cabin nestled away in the woods with a picturesque view of the lake. A great place to disconnect and relax
8735,146,"Shane’s cabin is just as described. Our family of 5 had a great time there. There is everything you could possibly want there from sheets, blankets, towels, to dishes, laundry stuff and even fishing poles. The pond is great with lots of fishing off the dock. There is a canoe and a couple of kayaks. Lots of seating on the porch, by the fire pit, and on the dock.
My kids also enjoyed feeding the ducks!"
8736,146,"Lf you are looking for piece and quiet, this is the place. Want to relax, unwind and enjoy the surroundings, this is it. Want to fish a little and enjoy some company, l mean Fonald and Daisy duck, the Lake House offers it all. Great place with a great value."
8737,146,This is a great place to relax and enjoy the pease and quiet of the lake in a great cabin. The lake side porch is awesome and so is the view. The trails are great and we found some interesting very old structures back in the woods. I would highly recommend this cabin.
8738,146,"I booked this lake cabin for my wife and I for our six year anniversary and it was perfect. We were looking for a private cottage to spend the weekend and we got so much more. Shane’s cabin was cozy and exciting. It had all the necessities of home, plus lots of fun lake activities. It ended up being colder outside than we thought so didn’t get to play in the water like we hoped, but we will def be back for some of that. The view from the dock on the lake is amazing and we loved sipping on our coffee watching the fisherman go by. We had a fun time visiting with the pet ducks Daisy and Donald. So funny and friendly! Can’t wait for the next trip. Definitely recommend this cottage to anyone looking to get away from it all. The host also was very accommodating when I asked if we could get into the cabin a few hours earlier due to us having dogs. That really took some
stress off the trip. Thank you Shane!"
8739,146,"when we pulled into the driveway, the sunset was over the lake with a full moon. it was the best welcome for our spring break. this place was absolutely awesome. I wanted a private area where I could sit on the porch and watch my kids play, fish, splash and bond. my son even built a few forts he left behind. This place was it. Every morning prepare to be greeted by the two local ducks, Donald and Daisy. Shane provides duck food to make this a cute little experience for anyone. the cabin is clean and comfy with a TV in each room. we cooked all our meals as everything was provided to do so. This place was so quiet at times it gives you the feel that you have the whole lake. It's nothing fancy but more of a nostalgic feeling of comfort and relaxation. Perfect porch swing view. when you first hit the road don't fret, just keep driving. Drive all the way to the end, no turns and when you enter into the driveway you can breathe with ease that you just found a little corner of heaven in the trees by the lake. it was just so great guys. I want to go back. thank you shane for the core memories we made.
ps- there are neighbors. they were kind when we saw them, which was twice. they are very quiet."
8740,146,This cabin is Exactly as described in the description along with pictures. We had a relaxing time. Enjoyed the cabin and trails was cold but got to kayak and fish in the snow! Very nice quiet private place with ducks that come visit every time you walk onto deck. The host was very quick to respond to anything we needed. Loved the wood stove to keep us warm. Will be back as soon as we can and this time in the summer to enjoy the breath taking views and warm weather to go swimming and canoeing .
8741,146,Been doing Airbnb's for a while now with my job and can honestly say one of the best places I've stayed in. Great location and Shane was always right on point with anything that needed to be done. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to be near the lake!!
8742,146,We loved our stay at the cabin. It was quiet and secluded with lake access just steps away.
8743,146,"This home was perfect for a combo of peaceful and playful. It is a gem! Shane was easy to communicate with. The kitchen was fully stocked with pots, pans, utensils and even fishing poles! We really loved this home! Just a short walk down path to Mayo Lake. The lake is a photographer's delight with changing colors throughout the day. Can't wait to return."
8744,146,"The Roxboro Lake House is A wonderful, remote place that had everything we needed—including strong WiFi—and at the he same time was remote and nostalgic. We paddled, skipped rocks, and played board games. A great time."
8745,146,"The cabin was a great experience. Shane was a caring host and the cabin itself was spacious and had great features. We enjoyed the fire pit, porch, and nice TV in the main room. The host let us know beforehand that the grill was no longer an option and the paddle boat is not available. If you have a group of up 5-6, there is plenty of sleeping space and it was a relaxing, fun experience."
8746,146,Absolutely fabulous and peaceful location. We have a big wake board boat and we were able to easily get the dock on the lake even with the low water. Shane is a fabulous host and this great home is a hidden gem!
8747,146,"Clean, cozy, and comfortable lake house. Beautiful private setting with access to a dock, firepit, and fabulous wrap around porch. We had only booked a weekend, but would love to have had more time to spend just soaking up the peace and quiet."
8748,146,"This was our second trip to Shane's, and we already can't wait to book a third. The location is private and perfect, and the house is so cozy! It was very hard to leave at the end of our trip."
8749,146,"Great rustic cabin stay. Shane was super communicative. Do not expect great cell
/internet reception."
8750,146,Bring a boat or jet ski if you have one!
8751,146,Very nice quiet place. Our boys had so much fun. Will definitely visit again!
8752,146,"What a hidden gem! Such an adorable lakefront cottage that provided the quiet serenity that is so rare and treasured these days. The host exemplified wonderful hospitality, as well as clear and expedient communication. Definitely on my ""will visit again"" list."
8753,146,My family loved staying here. It was very cozy and fun to be at. We will definitely be returning!
8754,146,Love every minute of it
8755,146,We really enjoyed our stay at the lake house! The space is very nice and comfortable and the lake is beautiful and very relaxing. The town had a great food store and anything else that you would need. The kitchen was stocked with cooking appliances and the fire pit was a great place to relax at night. Would recommended highly to anyone looking to get away and relax!
8756,146,"We had a great stay at the cabin, it had a great view of the lake and we went out on the kayaks and toured the area. The fire pit by the lake was also a highlight for us. The cabin has everything you should need for a nice get-away. Shane was very responsive to our questions before and during the stay. Easy self check in process too!"
8757,146,"At the end of a dirt road, we've discovered a wooden gem house, nestled by the lake in the forest. A typical wooden house with all the amenities and comfort you need! The porch overlooking the lake is the perfect place for a drink, reading a book or just relax in the rocking chairs. We had so much fun kayaking, canoeing, fishing and walking the trails in the forrest. Shane provides everything to spend a one of a kind stay at her house. Thank you ... and see you soon !!!!!"
8758,146,Shane went above and beyond as a host. We will definitely be back!
8759,146,"This is a very cute and comfortable lake house. Shane is a great host that is very quick to respond and willing to go out of her way to make sure everything is perfect. We were there with an ice storm approaching and she was willing to do whatever we needed. When it comes to hospitality, she is top notch.

The cabin was very comfortable with a working wood stove that pumped out a ton of heat. Everything you would need is provided, from towels to a coffee maker. There is a beautiful wrap around porch that provided lots of places to sit and enjoy the beautiful water views.

I would highly recommend this place and Shane. Looking forward to a return trip in the summer!"
8760,146,"Great little house on the lake. Everything you need. Had some weather issues, but Shane went above and beyond to make our stay special. Thank you"
8761,146,This location is beautiful! Only about 50 feet from the lake where kayaks and a canoe are readily available. The entire cabin is decorated phenomenally and the amenities in house are perfect for full weekend stays. The host is quick with responses and very kind. If you want a retreat away from the world this is the place to go. I didn’t even see a single person the whole time I was there! Very private with plenty of entertaining things to do.
8762,146,"Shane is a fantastic host! I enjoyed my stay at her cabin for the month of January. Beautiful views over the lake and plenty of places to walk my dog on the property or a quick drive away.

Very easy to drive down to Durham, Raleigh, or Chapel Hill to explore for the day. Would love to return!"
8763,146,Awesome place to relax! we will come back next year for sure!
8764,146,"I had arrived late at night after having car troubles and wasn’t able to see exactly where I was. In the morning I was astounded with the view of the lake and the beauty of the property! We saw a deer swimming through the lake (something I’d never seen before), and she jumped out on the property and ran into the woods. We took many little walk into the woods and found an old foundation and 2-story fireplace. It was incredible! My dad is an expert stone mason so he was extremely excited about this find. It is only help up by an old dead tree and I wouldn’t recommend getting too close, but what a cool relic of time! We spent time by the fire pit and had a couple nights of clear skies and a stellar meteor shower. The space itself had great amenities and I was able to make birthday cupcakes for my preschooler with ease. Shane is so kind and helpful and a wonderful host. There are a few dump sites leading down to the property, but they are not on Shane’s property. That being said, it did make me a little weary of the water quality and any runoff going into the lake affecting the fish/wildlife, as well as swimming. I studied aquifers and work in the environmental field, so this was a bit heartbreaking to me. Other than that, our stay was beautiful and I hope to return when the weather warms up!"
8765,146,"My family had a wonderful, socially distant Thanksgiving at Shane’s cabin. We had perfect weather and spent our days outside kayaking, fishing, and hanging out on the dock. Everything we needed for outdoor activities were provided. The cabin was rustic but had everything we needed (linens, dishes, wifi, etc). Sitting on the porch in the mornings drinking coffee was perfect. We never ventured to town, but did check out hiking at Mayo Lake Park, which was a short drive away. Highly recommend this place if you are looking for an outdoor getaway!"
8766,146,"We spent all morning on the beautiful porch, all day exploring the huge lake, and all evening around the fire pit. Couldn't of asked for a better location!"
8767,146,This place is nestled back off the road and pretty private. The cabin is rustic but has all the comforts needed to make the stay enjoyable and relaxing without roughing it too much. The lake was calm and relaxing. We fished and kayaked and spent quality family time around the fire pit in the evenings.
8768,146,"The location of the cabin was very good, you could walk right out on the porch and enjoy the view. We had some fires next to the lake and took the canoe out for fishing too. Overall a peaceful stay and only about 15-20 minutes to town for whatever you may need. The wifi worked well for zoom meetings as well. Hopefully we'll come back in the summer too!"
8769,146,"The cabin is very clean, homey, rustic and the best thing is the view of the lake and the expansive porches. The wifi was great which was important to us. Shane was so quick with communication and very welcoming."
8770,146,"Great place to stay by the lake. We had an awesome stay with natural nature life. Yes, I will be returning again. Our host did a great job with communication. The only thing is we had spotty phone service during our stay. We had to use the house WiFi to make calls through whats app. So be prepared to be somewhat off the grid. It’s was a very peaceful get away. We highly recommend it. Wish we could have stayed longer."
8771,146,Great little house with charm. Feels like your far away without being far from town. Good neighbors too.
8772,146,"Great house right on the lake! Swimming and fun for the whole family, especially the dogs!"
8773,146,Shane was a great host! The cabin had a great deck and amazing view of the lake. We hope to come back some day.
8774,146,We had such a lovely and relaxing time here! It is so beautiful and right on the water. We ate every meal on the dock and spent almost the whole time there or on the porch. The lake was quiet and serene. It seems like the houses end here so there was little boat traffic which made using the kayak and canoes so much fun. The rustic cabin was perfect for a week away and Shane made communication so easy. We hope to be back soon!
8775,146,"Everything you need for a peaceful getaway. I have no idea about local activities because we never left the lake. The lake is wonderful. Calm and refreshing, surrounded by woods, you can barely see most of the houses in the trees. It was perfect for kayaking. And I didn't even have to bring my kayak because there was one there. One thing I loved but my son didn't - in the afternoon the dock is in shade. He wanted to bake in the sun, not me. I could sit out there all day and enjoy the breeze off the water."
8776,146,"A rustic cabin in a nice spot by the lake. Nice to have a grill and picnic tables, as well as a canoe for going out on the lake."
8777,146,Exactly what we were looking for. Beautiful view of the lake while sitting in a rocking chair on the porch. It was peaceful and quiet. You can hear the wind in the trees and the crickets at night. The stars are so bright with no light pollution. The beds were very comfortable and we had everything we needed. My husband took our 2 girls out in the canoe and they caught their first fish with the poles Shane has waiting in the cabin. It was also perfect for our Golden Retriever. He spent most of our time in the lake with the kids. We look forward to coming back.
8778,146,"This place is a great value. It’s not five star accommodations, but that shouldn’t be expected for the price – it has cute touches but it’s a cozy, rustic cabin. The location on the lake is great – fairly tucked away in a quiet cove (for the most part – one day, there were guns being shot on the other side for several hours; I don’t know how frequently that happens). There are some close by neighbors, but we didn’t have any issues (e.g., noise) with them. Shane is a good host – committed, thoughtful and responsive. For example, at one point we lost internet service; I called her and she answered during a dentist appointment. She quickly called the provider and made sure service was restored. A couple things to keep in mind: 1) The grill is charcoal, and charcoal is not provided (nor, during our visit, were some other basic grill tools present). 2) We had no phone service; apparently some visitors do and some don’t. 3) The kitchen trash can has no lid, which could create odor and insect issues over a long enough stay."
8779,146,"This is a great location - right on the water with a great view from both the front porch and dock. The lake bottom is quite muddy, so if you're squeamish, you may want to bring water shoes to walk in/out of the lake. The water ""toys"" Shane has and the fire pit really make it a wonderful outdoor experience."
8780,146,We had a wonderful stay here! Our kids had a blast swimming and boating. Our 8-year-old liked it so much he kept asking if we could buy the place! We definitely hope to come back in the future.
8781,146,Great house. Perfect for a socially distance vacation. Fish were biting everyday. House was clean and well stocked. Definitely recommend.
8782,146,"Shane’s Place was even better than expected!! It had absolutely everything we needed and then some. Great, peaceful location!! The house was extremely clean! We will definitely be going back!"
8783,146,"Shane's place was AMAZING. It's got a Camp Crystal Lake vibe and we absolutely loved it. The cabin is adorable and shockingly clean, given it's older.
It had everything we needed to have an awesome time! We fished FOREVER, found wild blackberries while canoeing up the creek, took a dip in the water with doggo, did some bbq'ing, doodled, napped, and read on the dock. We also learned a little history about the property from the kindly permanent resident. Some other reviews mentioned trash - there are 2 dump sites on the drive in, but they're pretty far from the house and property itself. There's some yard/exterior debris, but it's also piled out of the way. Didn't bother us one bit. My family and I can't wait to get back!"
8784,146,"Shane was a delight. Informative, responsive and welcoming. We spent 10 days at the lake and loved it. Very secluded, private, fantastic porch to watch the water, great water access, safe and quiet lake. Played golf, went mountain biking, kayaking, hiked and just relaxed. Full kitchen, cooked every night. Very rustic and adorable. Hope to return!!"
8785,146,Shane's cabin is the perfect place to get away from it all. We enjoyed our stay there greatly!
8786,147,"If you are looking for somewhere peaceful to reset, this is the right place. Judith, Henry, and Ladybug are great, friendly hosts that have a lot to share. The whole property (with its own hiking trail and cool chill spots) is gorgeous. If you’re curious about how it is to live in a tiny home, this would definitely make you fall in love with the lifestyle."
8787,147,"thanks for the great review, you 'got' the place..."
8788,147,Staying in Peaceful Valley was amazing. The location was so tranquil and I felt right at home at the Airbnb. I will definitely come back!
8789,147,thank you for the kind review.
8790,147,"My partner and I enjoyed how unique and quirky the tiny house and the land it sits on are. This place is definitely one of a kind. Our favorite part was seeing the list of films that indicated the various props within the house and what set they were from. Henry, Judith and Ladybug are genuine souls who’ve created a magical getaway for those who can appreciate nature. I highly recommend!"
8791,147,"thank you for your kind review! Glad you had a good time even though it mostly rained...come back anytime, we show you the house and all the art inside next time!"
8792,147,"One of my favorite stays I’ve ever had on airbnb. Amazing location, records, walking trails, and such a peaceful place. I hope to be back soon!"
8793,147,"glad you enjoyed the records, we added some CD's to the mix for next year...."
8794,147,"It was a pleasure meeting Judith and Ladybug. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! The home was quiet, cozy, and contained everything we needed for the weekend. We would highly recommend this stay for anyone looking to get away for a bit."
8795,147,thank you!
8796,147,"This place was way better than we even thought it would be! Henry and his wife are so incredibly nice and the location of the stay is immaculate.

We can't wait to stay again."
8797,147,"Really neat place. My husband and I stayed here a few days. Hosts were helpful and thoughtful. The trails and various artwork were fun, as well as the items inside the home. Great value for the price. One thing I’d caution, if you are a heavier person, is that the mattress doesn’t offer much support, and sinks pretty badly. Probably wouldn’t be an issue for smaller people. Otherwise place is perfect and very peaceful."
8798,147,"Well, most people actually told us that they never slept as well as here in our cabin...and you are right, it might be a matter of weight...."
8799,147,What a delightful place! So much creative energy and a delightful getaway! Everything you lay your eyes on makes you think and wonder. What a joy to stay at this cozy tiny home that Judith and Henry have created! And to walk the property and see all the art mixed in nature!
8800,147,thank you for your kind review....we really enjoyed talking with you before you left!
8801,147,"This is the second time I booked a stay at Peaceful Valley and the Shiva Station with Henry, Judith and Ladybug.
This time my husband stayed there and was just as enamored with the place as I was. We’ll be back for individual/couples getaway as much as we can. Pure magic!"
8802,147,"thanks, we are looking forward to see and talk with you again...loved your company!"
8803,147,"Like many others who have stayed here before, if you’re looking to disappear this place is it. What Henry + Judith listed is really what you’re going to get. This tiny home really allows you to focus on yourself and enjoy the surrounding nature. There’s little trails and interesting Easter eggs here and there. The hosts are super friendly and they communicate really well. I unfortunately came when it decided to rain and there was a short power outage and the hosts came out to check on everything and let me know what was going on. Also, be sure to say hi to Ladybug!"
8804,147,thank you so much kingson for the great review. you were such a trooper this weekend and got to use our 'emergency power out bucket' as the first guest to do so....you were a great guest!
8805,147,"This listing should come with a warning label…Warning: returning to society will be very difficult after visiting Peaceful Valley. The Shiva Shack hugs you with peace while providing an interesting trinket around every corner. My husband and I walked the trails on the property at least 4 times. The trails are about a 30 minute walk if you keep going, but if you choose to stop and linger at each peaceful stop along the trail, you could spend a day in the woods. Henry and Judith are truly exceptional hosts. Peaceful Valley is calling me back!"
8806,147,"This is a magical place that you have stumbled on by good luck.
If you love art, nature, quiet and adventure this is your place.
It is a wonderland! This little cabin had everything I needed to make me feel cozy and at home."
8807,147,thank you and good luck with your photography...
8808,147,One will not find an experience such as this anywhere on the planet. Unique to the Nth degree. Super accommodating hosts. Made my last days together with my Autistic adult son a time that couldn’t be more than Just Right.
8809,147,glad you and clay had such a good time together....bring him back anytime....
8810,147,"This was my second visit, and as magical as the first. Whether it was a close encounter with a frog, or open eye meditations beside the lake, or the calming presence of the moon, I felt life as a deeply meaningful experience."
8811,147,we love to provide deeply meaningful experiences...glad you had them....see you soon...
8812,147,Beautiful & eclectic stay. Judith & Henry are very conscious hosts who value their peaceful property and their guests.
8813,147,Wonderful hosts with welcoming hearts. They’ve created an oasis and are generous in sharing it. I highly recommend for a relaxing retreat.
8814,147,thank you
8815,147,Definitely a gem!! If you’re thinking about it.. do it.
8816,147,"We booked this wonderful tiny home to get away from the city life and spend some quality time together and it was everything we needed. The home is inviting and magical, the land is welcoming, and the art is beautiful. 2 nights was not enough, we are already planning on another, longer visit."
8817,147,we are glad you liked it and want to come back...you are welcome anytime...
8818,147,"I came for a peaceful retreat from a busy urban life, and was delighted with the outcome. The lake calmed my thoughts. The trails supported my mindful walking. The night silence deepened my sleep. And I got some inspiring insights about my spiritual practices when using the Om Shanti space in the forest. This airbnb provides so much more than just a cozy home."
8819,147,we are glad that you GOT our space...it is really a retreat and we hope many others will find us here for their own explorations...this is beneficial for both the guests and the hosts. we love to see you coming back anytime...namaste
8820,147,"I feel like this location embodies a lot of what I love about Airbnb. It's quirky, the hosts are friendly, and you get a truly unique stay. I loved the remoteness, the walking trails, and the thoughtful decoration of the tiny house. It is a good place for someone who enjoys a little adventure in their travel."
8821,147,thanks and all the best on your future adventures!!
8822,147,"This place has so much to offer. We never left the property! It was more than I had imagined. By far, my favorite airbnb and host ever! I am already looking at my calendar to come back!!!!!"
8823,147,well you know henry's response to that: Come back soon!! We enjoyed BOTH of you to the max!
8824,147,"I couldn't have asked for a better experience! The house was comfy and had everything I needed. The property is beautiful and I loved walking the trails, sitting next to the stream, and painting by the pond. Judith and Henry are wonderful hosts and beautiful people. I look forward to returning with friends and family!"
8825,147,we enjoyed hosting a super guest/friend! we would love to see you unfold in your artistic life - and being able to say: we knew her before she came famous (and rich)!!! we really love what you and your family are doing with your life...
8826,147,"The most PERFECT place for anyone looking to escape away into nature! The property is absolutely beautiful and the artwork located in different spots around it are amazing. If you’ve never driven through the mountains before, don’t worry as it’s pretty easy to get through. Also, make sure to keep an eye out for ladybug… aka the cutest dog ever 🥰"
8827,147,"thanks for the kind review, looking forward to hosting you again, hint, hint..."
8828,147,"As promised and so very much more. I found myself tiptoeing around to keep from disturbing nature. Rain drops, frog croaks, thunder, trickling brook splashes, a bird or three up in the branches. Who needs anything else? Judith and Henry love this Pleasant Valley and have curated their space to give visitors an escape from the mess we leave behind when turning on to Wyatt Road.

Then there’s the memorabilia from two careers building cinematic stage sets. You just have to see this for yourself. Amazing. For me, my next visit will not be marred by reasons to venture outside Pleasant Valley. I want to be nowhere but here until forced to leave."
8829,147,"That was a very nicely written review, will!! Thank you! you got the place and us....we hope to see you again sometime....and talk about the world and everything..."
8830,147,this place is the perfect getaway to unplug and unwind. the atmosphere is relaxing and calming. we recommend coming here if your feeling stressed out and need to clear your head! Henry and Judith and Ladybug are some of the kindest and coolest beings on Earth!
8831,147,we are glad you liked it!!
8832,147,"We feel a bit selfish in sharing this review. Part of us doesn't want too and the other part wants to shout it from the mountain top! Or the Valley -- a lil' inside joke! It's because it's a magical place! if you come here, leave everything on White Oak Road, the work, the worries, the stress, the lap top, the phone, well actually you will need that for Hanry & Judith's directions! But when you park, just turn it on airplane mode and escape! This is your place to unwind, explore, and listen. Please read the guest book - we enjoyed reading to each other a few pages each morning! If you are lucky enough for rain, stand in it, share stories and remember, the rain cleanses the soul! At night, open the windows and listen to the sweet music! This is a great place to find comfort in and refuge from the outside world. Enjoy it!"
8833,147,"thanks for this very kind review, we know you got this place and we are glad that you had such a good time. maybe we can reconnect again in the future! As they say, come as a guest, leave as a friend - we sure felt like that!! By the way, we got an apology from the neighbor per email..."
8834,147,"This place is AMAZING. Everything was as expected and more. The house is probably the most creatively curated place I have ever been in, with a theme complete from objects from the movie sets. The bed is super comfortable, and the selection of vinyls and tapes gave me so much joy to play around with. Just being in this space put gave me so much relief from anxiety and my troubles. You truly won't find a problem at all. The hosts were not only super responsive to all the requests I had, and did their best to accommodate me in any way they could, but they proved to be wonderful people who gave me space to roam but also provided wonderful conversations I'll remember for a very long time. And the property they have is GORGEOUS. You could spend weeks here and not get bored, with trails filled with so much art and attention to detail on the property itself. Around the property there are also trails you can spend your time on, and driving out of the immediate area you have many trails on the Blue Ridge. They deserve all of the praise I and the previous guests have given them. They even have a guest book where you could read how this place has affected the lives of those who have stayed here. I will certainly be back. Thank you dearly Henry, Judith, and Ladybug!"
8835,147,"wow what a review!! Mark really GOT this place in all aspects and he got both of us too, what a rare find of a person...we hope we will see him a lot more times here in the valley - as a friend not a guest!"
8836,147,Henry and Judith are two very good hosts. They were accommodating and kind.
8837,147,"Henry and Judith have a wonderful and quiet place, excellent to escape the business of daily life. The place is very much value for money and I hope more people get to enjoy this."
8838,147,"If you truly want to connect with nature, art, and sustainable living - Henry’s&Jodi’s place is a perfect place to do so! I restored my energy and connected with my daughter there, and had a magical experience overall. My daughter made friends with all the adorable ladybugs on the property, enjoyed herself jumping on the trampoline in the woods (whaaat?!), and walking those lovely trails that are also a part of the property, and seeing all the incredible art that is created by both Jodi&Henry spread everywhere. We loved this place so much, and we are definitely coming back! Connecting with the hosts is truly inspiring, and you will learn a lot. Definitely recommend staying at their lovely peaceful valley and enjoy yourself!"
8839,147,"thank you soooo much for being the perfect guests, we look forward to seeing you again in the summer maybe and we'll talk A LOT MORE!!!"
8840,147,This place is a perfect mountain escape. My husband and I enjoyed every moment of our stay. The location is perfect to explore the local beauty or branch out to surrounding areas. The house is immaculate and the compost toilet is simple to use and was no problem for us. The bed was so comfortable and was a great place to rest to get rejuvenated for your adventures the next day. The cabin held heat wonderfully for our 20 degree nights. The vibe is welcoming and homey. You won’t regret venturing out to this gem. Happy travels!
8841,147,"thanks you so much for the detailed review! and you left the place immaculate, what a treat for me!! thanks"
8842,147,"Have you ever stayed at an Air B&B that has a guest book filled with comments from travelers about how their experience transformed and inspired them - or showed them something about the way they'd like to live - or was the perfect place to create art/music/etc - or offered exactly the rest and respite that is so desperately needed in these challenging times?

Me neither, until my stay in Millers Creek. And when it came time to write my own guest book entry, I couldn't help but use the word ""magical"" to describe both the physical environment as well as the hosts.

If you're considering staying here, be sure to check the listing in full because there are some details about the location and check-in that you'll want to be sure to read before planning or embarking on your trip.

Also, if you go, please know that this space is a refuge that should be treated with the utmost respect. The woods on/surrounding the property are otherworldly and being stewarded so incredibly by Judith and Henry. It's a blessing that they've opened up their land to folks - and at such an amazing price - so if you're lucky enough to find yourself at this tiny home, I predict you will find yourself returning home filled with gratitude afterward, just as I did!"
8843,147,"You just won the best review of the year award...it will be handed over in March, hint hint....well we think you 'got' our place and what we are about. looking forward to seeing you in the spring. by the way, you were a pretty amazing guest too...."
8844,147,The tiny house is just as advertised. Very quiet and peaceful. Judith and Henry were very helpful and extremely nice.
8845,147,thank you and best of luck finding that special place....
8846,147,"This place is a great stay at a great value. If you are looking for a place to be off the grid and enjoy nature, this place is perfect. It was easy to find between the directions given by Henry and Judith and Apple Maps also gave us completely accurate directions as well. They have plenty of well marked trails through their property and it's beautiful to explore. The double bed was a little bit of a tight squeeze for two adults, but it was honestly worth it to be in the mountains like that. Extra bonus was their sweet dog Ladybug who came to say hi often!"
8847,147,"sorry to hear about the double bed being to tight, it's the first comment of that kind we ever got in 4 years and hundreds of guests sleeping here. Normally we hear that everybody sleeps like a baby and the bed is nice and cozy...It is a tiny house after all and a king size would not fit in here....Thanks for inviting ladybug into the tiny house to let her say hello!"
8848,147,"This was such a unique stay!
We are from Ohio so it was a 8hr33m+ drive. With when we were leaving to come out there, it was not check in time. But this host was able to accommodate me checking in at 10am!

Upon arrival, the host had suffered a loss the night before. So they were not too involved in our stay & they expressed their apologies, however we prefer a quiet stay! So it worked out perfectly!

For those wanting to come visit, I highly recommend. If you want souvenirs or any city life I recommend going to Boone, NC which is a 1hr away but it takes 25 minutes to even get off the mountain so it doesn’t feel like an hour!


Thanks for the great stay!"
8849,147,thanks for the kind review...
8850,147,"It’s a great spot for anyone wanting a little something different, away from noise and light pollution. Comfy bed and unique concept."
8851,147,thank you...esp. about the comfy bed....
8852,147,it was amazing
8853,147,thank you
8854,147,"Delightfully creative, sustainable and peaceful place and stay. I really loved it here. Henry and Judith have created a unique and special nook in the mountains and share it with us. Description is on point. If you like creativity, functional art, informal and relaxing spaces this is for you. I valued my time interacting with the hosts as much as they stay itself. Want to Return. You can fill a whole week just on the property but there’s a lot of nature related things to see and do close by as well."
8855,147,thanks for the great review and we love to stay connected and read your blog and follow your future travel series with your trusted sidekick....great that we finally met!!!
8856,147,"This was truly a one of a kind experience. The scenery around the home was beautiful; tucked away in the woods with a gorgeous view of the pond. The home was well stocked with pots and pans, books and tons of film memorabilia and everything was very clean and accessible. Our only mistake we felt we made was booking our stay for such a short time– we are so looking forward to coming back and spending some more time in the area. Thanks for having us!!"
8857,147,thanks for the great review!
8858,147,Very memorable experience! check it out
8859,147,good luck with nora...
8860,147,"My favorite place! My daughter and I visit every year. If you're a lover of nature and art, this place is 100% for you."
8861,147,you know we love you both....
8862,147,"What a gem!!!

Affordable and adorable <3
Judith & Henry have put so much love & time into this property!
They are not only very friendly but organized and helpful.

Amazing features: From the many artistic specialities along their trail, the large pond, pleasant creek, creative & funky tiny home, large selection of vinyl, great shower pressure… I’m baffled how sweet this spot is on the map!

I really needed a get away in nature and their place delivered; They made me feel right at home :)

I will Definitely be back! XOXOXO <3"
8863,147,can't wait to have you back...thanks for the great review
8864,147,"Super cool house to stay in. The hosts were super nice, they gave us a brief but very informative orientation. Walking the trails were a big highlight of the trip. Definitely looking forward to staying here again."
8865,147,great that you 'got' our place...you are always welcome back!
8866,147,"Wonderful cozy little home, beautiful property all around. Hosts are very polite, hope to return someday!"
8867,147,thanks for being such easy guests and leaving the cabin super clean was extra cool!!
8868,147,"OMG.. This was such a bless trip for me, everything was perfect ... Love the house, the place , the nature that surround it, the calm, the serenity was what my soul need it.
Judith and Henry have an amazing place, the garden with the chakras it was my favorite spot to meditate in the mornings.
I will definitely come back soon ! :) Gracias, Gracias, Gracias"
8869,147,"we also felt really connected to you and we do hope that you can come back soon and stay for the whole time... Thanks again for the rose quartz, the space will definitely benefit from it!! Gracias!"
8870,147,"Thanks so much for the hospitality! Henry and Judith are welcoming and friendly hosts but also give you privacy. Cabin is nestled in the woods and gives treehouse vibes. Great hot water and shower pressure, compost toilet was no stress. Very unique space, eclectic record collection. Surrounding land is beautiful and very peaceful. Go find the trampoline in the forest! So much fun."
8871,147,thanks for the detailed review! Good luck for your future life plans...
8872,147,Great peaceful location to wander in the woods & relax. My theater daughter really enjoyed herself exploring the movie artifacts.
8873,147,thank you
8874,147,"Great stay: beautiful space, awesome people, great location! 🌻"
8875,147,"thanks, looking forward to some talks around the fire pit...."
8876,147,"The Tiny House is the perfect spot for anyone looking for a peaceful, restful experience in nature"
8877,147,thank you and happy hiking....
8878,149,"This place was perfect for our getaway and is exactly what you see in the pictures. It was very clean and we really enjoyed the hot tub. Jonathan is a great host and very responsive, we would definitely rent again."
8879,149,Enjoyable place
8880,149,The place was amazing! We enjoyed the beautiful views. Watching the sunrise from there was awesome. The place was exactly what we imagined. Will definitely recommend to others and would definitely book again!
8881,149,The hot with a beautiful view made for an amazing getaway.
8882,149,"Great home in a great location! We enjoyed the hot tub and views. Great location- close to Emerald Isle beaches, kayaks nearby, lots of great restaurants too! Very clean. Jonathan was extremely helpful and replied quickly when we had questions. 5 stars- great place to stay. Thank you!!"
8883,149,"Wonderful and beautiful view!
The place is filled with amenities and stay was super comfortable. We enjoyed it a lot!
Owner is very helpful and responsive."
8884,149,Enjoyed the place. It was just like the pictures . Very relaxing. Will definitely book again in the future.
8885,149,Everything was exactly as described and we had a great stay!
8886,149,The location was absolutely beautiful. We had an amazing night!
8887,149,Very nice with beautiful view. Highway noise was sometimes a little distracting but we didn’t know the area so didn’t realize it was busy. We saw many birds and beautiful sunrises off the porch and deck area.
8888,149,Spending the evening and sunrise in a clean hot tub overlooking a Bay Area was so amazing. The house was beautiful and I especially liked being able to see the waters through the huge windows at the foot of the bed. An awesome sound system in the house for great beachy vibes. Definitely will be back each year!! Thanks again ✅
8889,149,Amazing moon views.
8890,149,Great place very clean and nice. View from the porch and bedroom were amazing
8891,149,"Cute house with great views. Great for a weekend getaway, nice hot tub. We enjoyed our stay. Jonathan is very responsive and helpful."
8892,149,Nice place with a great view! Very convenient with our 1 year old as there was a pack-n-play and some kids toys available.
8893,149,"Everything was as advertised and host was very professional, flexible and helpful. Looking forward to visiting again!"
8894,149,We arrived with music playing which was very fitting. The hot tub was so enjoyable to us. The coffee bar was a big plus for us in which we utilized all throughout the day. Perfect location. Restaurants are not too far away on either side. Can’t wait to book again soon
8895,149,Great getaway 👌
8896,149,"The hot tub and water views were amazing. We also took advantage of the kayak and took a quick trip around the marsh area. Definitely a memorable experience. I think that Jonathan had done an amazing job of turning the back part of this property into a peaceful vacation oasis. However, this home is off a busy 4 lane road which did take away from the overall peacefulness for us. We live in the county on 6 acres and we’re at times very distracted by the road. I suggest brining noise canceling ear phones if you are easily distracted by noise. Other than the busy road, this house was amazing and Jonathan is an exceptional host! Highly recommend this vacation home!"
8897,149,"This was my 1st airbnb experience and I was not disappointed! Jonathan was a perfect host. My niece and I enjoyed our stay and the property was perfect for the dogs and us. The hot tub on the back deck overlooking the marsh was so relaxing and the busy highway provided an almost constant hum that I found very soothing. My niece, however, is a very light sleeper and wasn't as happy with the 'white noise' ;-) I would not hesitate to book with Jonathan again!"
8898,149,"Beautiful home! House was super clean, view was amazing and everything was perfect. We will definitely be back! Thank you again for sharing your beautiful home with us :)"
8899,149,Wonderful place to stay. The description was spot on. Great place for getaway. Great food nearby. Perfect place for us to go back and forth for MCT graduation.
8900,149,"Jonathan's location was just what we needed. The views and spaces to enjoy, from the dining table, to the hot tub, to the bedroom windows, were incredible & serene. The experience has seriously made us fall in love with the marsh, I found myself enjoying it more than being close to the beach. Short drive from Swansboro, such a cute town to walk around in & incredible restaurants. Then just another short drive to the beach. When we first pulled in, we were a little thrown by how close it was to the road & being able to hear the cars drive by, but do not let that stop you! When you're in the back side of the house, you don't notice any of it at all & feels like it's far away from everything. Great tv/internet setup, too. And great communication from host, this place is a gem & very well taken care of. We look forward to coming back!"
8901,149,"Came to the coast with my dog as a new North Carolinian and to enjoy a hot tub I moved away from Up North. The house was as described, well equipped and comfortable. I really liked the surround sound on the big TV as there are 3 in the house for larger groups. With it being off season with not much to do as well as being a solo guest, the hot tub was the main draw for me. It was basic. For most people that won't matter as they will enjoy the area attractions and each other, along with all the other amenities the house provides. Nice stay, Thanks Jonathan."
8902,149,"Beautiful view, comfortable home, and very responsive host! Very close to the beach and plenty of food options around. Would definitely recommend!"
8903,149,Super great home!! Loved the hot tub and view!
8904,149,What a fantastic little place me and my partner were there for our first anniversary! Look forward to making another stay at some point in the future!
8905,149,"Double water therapy! I didn’t do much besides soak in the hot tub while staring at the water view. The town nearby; Swansboro, is a bird sanctuary with a quaint downtown. It’s a quick drive to Emerald Isle if you want some time at the beach.

This was the cleanest Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in which was especially nice given that it’s pet friendly. The space itself was cute and the view can’t be beat. I could absolutely see myself coming back and am thrilled I chose this location for my vacation this year."
8906,149,"Great spot! Hot tub is excellent, nice quiet location. Highly recommend."
8907,149,Very cozy and well decorated place. We loved all the extra touches. We will definitely be back!
8908,149,"Beautiful place! Absolutely great spot to unwind. We loved the proximity to shops and places to eat, as well as the gorgeous views. Can't recommend enough!"
8909,149,Great view of the water!
8910,149,"The home was beautiful and welcoming. The view and the sunrise over the lake was amazing. Everything was clean, stocked and the homeowners communicated every step of the way and made themselves available even into the evening to answer questions. Definitely worth it and will return and recommend.!"
8911,149,"This place was fantastic, clean and as described. We had everything we needed and wanted at the house. The view was amazing and the hot tub made the stay during the cold weather very worth it. As other reviews have stated, it’s right off the road. The road noise was a lot for us especially considering we work night shift and preferred sleeping in. That’s the only thing we really didn’t like - but everything else made the stay worth it and more."
8912,149,"It is a place to help release stress, I fell in love with the beauty of it. Having my morning coffee was so relaxing , not even the rain interfer with it."
8913,149,"This was our second time staying at Jonathan’s listing. The place always has everything you need. Both, in bathrooms and kitchen very well stocked. The jacuzzi was a huge plus, very relaxing esp during the cold season. This place is great for a getaway of relaxation and connection to nature. We really enjoy the scenic sunrise and sunsets from their place! Jonathan is also extremely responsive and will go out of his way to make sure their guests are comfortable. Thanks for hosting such great place!"
8914,149,This stay was incredible and romantic 10/10
8915,149,"Fantastic view, wonderful little town with lots to do. Hot tub was amazing and the house is decorated so beautifully."
8916,149,"Excellent host, the place looked just like on pictures we saw on Airbnb. Highly recommend! We will be back!"
8917,149,"Our stay was great! The issues we had were our own (a 2 year old who wanted to walk around with the coasters or open cabinets but hey, kids right? lol) The fenced area was perfect for our Doggo and the view is spectacular. Watching the sunrise in the hottub is second to none. The house across the marsh had a dozen white xmas trees out and it was a perfect festive touch. WELL STOCKED and had every amenity. Couldn't have been better. Wish we could have stayed longer!"
8918,149,great location for a girls relaxing weekend. bridal shower party and wedding planning.
8919,149,Jonathan was very responsive to any concerns we had.
8920,149,I had my honeymoon and it was absolutely perfect!!! The home was extremely clean and well kept! I would definitely recommend this home to anyone!
8921,149,"The house and views are beautiful. You won’t want to leave the hot tub. Jonathan was extremely responsive to the few questions we had during our stay. Also, Boro was terrific - we ate there twice."
8922,149,"Place was clean and wonderful, view and amenities were second to none. Close to beach and other fun attractions around town. Communication with host was excellent, looking forward to staying again!"
8923,149,Great view and a clean little house to stay in. The house is right off of highway 24 and the traffic can be a little loud at time. Overall it was a great stay at a house in a good location to food and entertainment.
8924,149,Gorgeous location just what we were looking for to spend some relaxation time. Jonathan was a great host with clear communication. Beautiful decor with thoughtful and well appointed guest amenities.
8925,149,Wonderful home in a perfect location! Highly recommend staying here. The house was so clean and perfect for a small family! We will definitely come back again.
8926,149,Very kind and willing to help the view from the bed room window in beautiful
8927,149,Great place and location!!
8928,149,"Came to this home for a birthday getaway. My boyfriend and I could not have enjoyed the location more, and loved being able to kayak and fish right off the backyard! The house is perfectly located close to both Swansboro and Emerald Isle. We highly recommend taking the ferry nearby to Hammock’s Beach State Park!"
8929,149,"great place to stay with a beautiful view of the sunrise, nice hot tub, and located in the middle of plenty of places to eat and shop"
8930,149,We had a great time staying at Johnathan's place right on the water. We used the hot tub both nights which was lovely. The house worked out just fine for us but it is right next to a busy street and the car noise can be annoying at times. Very pretty sunrises and lots of bird wildlife.
8931,149,Great stay! Our 2 toddlers and 2 dogs joined us and we can’t find anything negative to say! The location was amazing and we really enjoyed our stay!
8932,149,Highly recommend this house. The hosts are very accommodating and did everything they could to make our stay nice. The view was very nice and we even saw a stingray in the water!
8933,149,"We really enjoyed our stay! The property had such thoughtful features and everything we needed. The coffee bar was impressive, as was the entertainment options and surround sound. Jon was a great host, super communicative and responsive the one time we reached out. Despite the proximity to the main road, the sound of traffic wasn’t too bad. The only recommendation I’d make is blackout curtains for the bedroom. The light off the main road is pretty bright and. Thanks for a great stay!"
8934,149,"Out of all my stays at an Airbnb, hands down, this was my favorite!
Beautiful and comfy home with the luxury of fishing right in the backyard!
Jonathan was courteous enough to shoot me a call to warn me of how the tides would look a bit concerning due to the hurricane that passed by. Such a pleasant person to speak to!
I am looking forward to staying here again!!!"
8935,149,"Thank you for staying in our home, you are welcome back anytime. Our goal is truly to give folks a little taste of the peace and quiet of Swansboro, NC. I am glad you found that on your trip. Safe travels my friend and hope to meet you the next time you're down this way."
8936,149,Amazing!
8937,149,Amazing place!! I stayed at both of their properties in Cedar Point. I can’t say enough about their properties and hosts!! Cutest decorated cottage with everything you need for an amazing stay! Didn’t use the hot tub but it was there and functional. Beds were amazingly comfortable. The place was spotless and I would most definitely stay again!!
8938,149,The view is absolutely amazing from this place!! And it’s such a cozy place for multiple people or even 2 people. Would definitely recommend it!
8939,149,if perfect was a place😊
8940,149,Great stay
8941,149,Excellent host. Fantastic communication and extremely accommodating. Terrific spot for fishing.
8942,149,Beautiful view and great location! We had a wonderful couple days
8943,149,"Exactly what my mom and I were looking for on our gals trip. We spent a ton of time kayaking and enjoying the hot tub. Also really appreciated how well stocked the house was in terms of daily needs (shower stuff, cooking utensils, cleaning supplies, etc). Would love to come back again!"
8944,149,"Beautiful view. So much fun fishing right from the backyard. The road in front is very busy and noisy but if that doesn't bother you, this is an amazing location. Even has a fence around the backyard that helps make this house more dog friendly. We loved it, overall."
8945,149,"This cute cottage is right on the inland waterway and is very cozy and welcoming! It’s not too far from the actual beach, just a short car ride, and very close to restaurants and shops. The hot tub was so much fun, and while we didn’t have time to try out the kayak I just know it would have been a blast to scoot right out on the smooth water. Thanks Johnathan!"
8946,149,great getaway and enjoyed kayaking!
8947,149,Thank you so much! Our vacation was enjoyable at your location. The drive to venture out and do anything was literally within a few miles. Paradise on the back patio!
8948,149,"Great location, great hosts, super helpful."
8949,149,"The marsh access is AMAZING! And the house is so cute and comfy! It is definitely on a busy road and during heavy traffic times, you will be able to hear it. But enjoy the house for the access that it has to water! Incredible!"
8950,149,Great little piece of paradise! Property exactly how described! The backyard is perfect and throughly enjoyed our stay!
8951,149,"Beautiful view, well appointed. Some road noise, but it is less noticeable with music or TV on. Nice location close to Swansboro and Emerald Isle. Good WiFi for working but no private work space."
8952,149,Amazing place. Spectaculair views and privacy. Welcome basket with snacks was a great touch. Can’t wait to come back !
8953,149,Beautiful location. Super cozy. Love the easy access to the marsh for the kayaks.
8954,149,We loved this house so much! My kiddos loved the Legos and Lincoln logs! and especially loved throwing the net and catching little fish. So many memories created with our short stay. Thank you!

I would highly recommend great for any type of occasion. 😀😀😀😀"
8956,149,We really enjoyed our stay. Our kids loved being able to take the kayaks out everyday. The view was wonderful and just a quick trip to the beach. It was very clean with lots of extra touches to make you feel welcome. Jonathon was very friendly and responsive.
8957,149,Great space. We were very comfortable. Kids fished for hours!
8958,149,"This stay is a little slice of heaven!
It’s the perfect combination of waterfront and seclusion!"
8959,149,"Great location. Description was accurate. The house is close to the highway, but it mentions this in the description so it was not a surprise. Beautiful location to view the sunrises and sunsets off the sound, and if you enjoy kayaking it’s a wonderful place to do so!"
8960,149,"Loved the house, the views were amazing. Kayak provided was such a cool idea and we rode out into the water. House is in amazing shape inside, so nice! Loved the snacks. provided!"
8961,149,"Nice clean place, as described. Lots of marine life and marshland good stuff. Great kayaking spot."
8962,149,"Wonderful place to stay! Perfect location. The hosts are so thoughtful with the extras in the home! (Snacks, games, condiments, beach towels, and much more). I recommend staying here."
8963,149,We had a great time fishing from the backyard and enjoyed relaxing in the hot tub.
8964,149,Beautiful views and relaxing environment
8965,149,"A very comfortable stay for me and the Mrs. Very clean, nicely updated and really nice being on the water. The hot tub and kayak were added bonuses.
Yes, it’s on a busy road, but there is a turning lane, so getting in and out wasn’t bad at all.
The back of the house felt very private and was a nice place to relax. The master bedroom facing the sunrise was also very nice."
8966,149,They are quick to respond and it is close to the beach
8967,149,"The outside of the house doesn’t do justice to the inside. Such a charming home with a beautiful view! Owners were very responsive, and things were done with a sense of urgency. Great communication."
8968,149,Its very comfortable and clean.
8969,149,"Enjoyed our stay! The home is lovely and well appointed. Having kayak access was a nice bonus, and the hot tub and view were excellent. Convenient location as downtown Swansboro is walkable. Would stay here again - thanks for everything!"
8970,149,Jonathan’s home is immaculate and offers beautiful views. My son thoroughly enjoyed the hot tub and being able to jump in the water! The house was nicely renovated and I took advantage of the wonderful coffee station. Only down side was the highway traffic noise at night.
8971,149,Fantastic! Great place and great fishing! Will stay there again
8972,149,THE BEST PLACE TO STAY. It was the most beautiful area - so close to everything we wanted to do and the host(s) made sure we had everything we needed and communicated with us whenever we needed. We will most definitely be making this place our go to ♥️
8973,149,We are already looking forward to staying again soon!
8974,149,"Situated on a busy road, just so you are aware. The place is very cute and well kept, and the hosts are very responsive and courteous to their guests needs"

8981,149,Fun cottage by the shore! Cozy and comfy.
8982,149,"Had a great stay for 2 nights, the place was exactly as pictured and the views off the deck did not disappoint. The hot tub was also a great feature. Very clean and comfortable.


*only note would be the proximity to the road. I sleep pretty heavy but though the master bedroom faces the water, I was able to hear car traffic in the morning"
8983,149,Very cozy home right next to the water! Was everything we could ask for our little anniversary getaway! Favorite places we ate are: Saltwater grill for dinner and Yanas for breakfast!
8984,150,"Sophia's home was perfect for our one night stay during our travels. It is close to the highway, well appointed, cozy, clean, and the bed was so comfortable, I did not want to get up.....at....all. The porch is screened in, and if the weather had been nicer, I would've enjoyed it.

Sophia is communicative and the listing is as stated and the pictures are accurate. We would absolutely stay again when traveling south. Recommended!"
8985,150,Perfect place to rest our heads traveling to Florida. Easy to get too!
8986,150,One of the best air bnb we stayed out. We stopped here to get some rest from our trip home from florida to ny it was a great one night stay. Awesome air bnb. Will deff. Stay again on our trip down again. Thank you.
8987,150,"We stayed here for 1 night on our was from Canada to Florida and it was the perfect stop. Quiet, peaceful, comfortable, easy to find, clean, welcoming, and had everything we needed. I would stay there again! I asked for a recommendation for a fish and was recommended Pier 41 and it was great!"
8988,150,"Sophia's place was so peaceful, restful, and it felt like home. Super cute.

We really enjoyed the evening sitting outside on the screened in porch. We got to watch the sky and it got dark

Sophia's communication was excellent and she was very responsive. You could not have had it any better than hers.

She even thought of windowshield cleaner. I got to remove the bugs before heading back out on my 12 hr journey.

There is a ramp there for anyone who needs a little help with getting in or who wants to roll in their suitcases.

Loved the coffe bar, too.

I would highly recommend her place ❤️"
8989,150,"Had an amazing night, was so comfortable felt like home for sure. We would highly recommend to anyone wanting to stay a few nights"
8990,150,Thanks for explaining the cleanliness issue. We wash all sheets after every use. There was a stain on a sheet that I missed when remaking the bed. I have tossed those sheets out and replaced those sheets. I strive to keep my home as clean as possible. If you ever have any cleanliness issues please contact me so I can fix the situation. I clean the home my self to insure you have a clean rental.
8991,150,Quiet location to stay
8992,150,"Sophia’s place was just what my daughter and I needed after a long drive from Daytona. She loved having her own room and I loved the spacious bathroom attached to my bedroom. I made use of Sophia’s complimentary car cleaning products she left out. What an awesome idea! We were comfy, cozy and enjoyed a movie!! It was chilly when we arrived but found the thermostat and the place heated up quickly. Great stay!"
8993,150,"Amazing place! Convenient to highway 95 - about 5 min. Peaceful and quiet county setting. The house has all you need for a restful stay: comfortable beds, full kitchen. Organized and very clean! Will definitely stay again."
8994,150,Sophia is a wonderful helpful host and we really enjoyed our night’s stay! Such a cute and clean place with plenty of room for the three of us.
8995,150,"Awesome little coffee nook, beds were super comfortable, quiet location and easy to get back to 95."
8996,150,Beautiful home and host was extremely helpful.
8997,150,"The pictures of this Airbnb do not do justice to the character of the home… this is by far one of the best places we have enjoyed! I felt like an honored guest. There is absolutely nothing I would change about this Airbnb… If I could give a rating of over five in every category, I certainly would. Highly recommend this location except for the times that I want to stay there!"
8998,150,Exceptional stay! Sophia is such a great host. Very attentive and helpful! Was very flexible! The place was such a great place to spend the night. Felt like home!

I'd definitely recommend this place, as it's well worth it and conveniently located right off the 95."
9002,150,Just as described! Everything was clean and bed was super comfortable. Shower was also very nice. We enjoyed the very well stocked kitchen for cooking and all the extra little touches here and there like the coffee bar and some snacks to enjoy! We will definitely be back again if we’re in this area again! Thanks for providing Sucha great stay!!
9003,150,"Wonderful stay! Excellent value. Very clean, easy to access and great communication and directions. Our kids really enjoyed playing in the backyard in the morning. Lots of extra amenities. Amazing stay! We'll be back."
9004,150,"This is a very peaceful house. If you ever need to get away from the city but not too far , this is the place for you. Restaurants are just 10 mins away but you definitely feel like nobody is around miles. After a long day at the toy convention, it was nice to settle down in a quiet house ."
9005,150,"I feel like this is my ""little home"" in Robeson County...This is quiet, country, has good WiFi and a great kitchen. The beds are comfortable and this host is superb!"
9006,150,"So thankful we found this place to spend the night while on a work trip.
We loved the little country house ❤️
Super clean and cozy. Very responsive host.

9013,150,My family enjoyed this little gem. I would love to come back !!
9014,150,"House is great, just a few minutes from I95 but far enough away you have peace and quiet. The house was clean, nicely decorated and Sophie communicated all instructions very well. Highly recommend if you are traveling through the area looking for an alternative to a hotel. We felt right at home here. Sophie added some nice touches as well (snacks, coffee, hot chocolate etc). Thank you for a great stay!"
9015,150,"The house is roomy and very cozy; easy to find and in a safe peaceful area.

Sophia was sweet and comunicative, and made sure we had everything we needed fir the night.

Thank you and would recommend to others."
9016,150,"Sophia’s place was a home away from home! Very clear instructions. Easy access from the freeway and close to get food. All was 7 mins away!
If I come through this way again I would definitely rent again ! 💕😎"
9017,150,Thanks and hope you have safe travels back home.
9018,150,Sophia was great with communication from beginning to check out. The place was cozy and clean. We only spent the night to sleep as we were road tripping from Florida back to New Jersey but would‘be loved to stay here a few more days. Our family enjoyed the environment as it’s different from where we live and we felt at peace with how quiet it was since we live in the city. Would recommend staying here!
9019,150,"Sophia's place was so comfy and cozy. As someone with mobility struggles, I was really happy to see a ramp up to the back porch and pull bars in the bathroom. The Christmas decorations made the space even more homey. There is some noise from the traffic, but that didn't bother us. There was room to ""camp out"" on the deck and make smores. This home is in the country but minutes to everything you could need. Excellent bnb!!!"
9020,150,"Wonderful little 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom home in the country. Easy to get to Lumberton and to I -95...Extremely helpful host with such a cozy spot for weary travelers!"
9021,150,Sophia’s cute little home was absolutely spotless and so well kept! She went out of her way to make you feel at home. Sophia was amazing at how well she made herself available to answer questions. Everything was so neat and tidy! I loved it!
9022,150,"Quite possibly the nicest stay I've ever had at an Airbnb. The pictures don't do it justice. Sophia's place has comfortable furniture, everything clean and orderly, all the things you could need to feel at home readily available. We had a lovely, quiet, cozy stay. I highly recommend it!"
9023,150,"Enjoyed our stay, will book again!"
9024,150,We loved this house felt right at home.

I would love to come back 💯 for a recommendation. Thank you for the detail with my children"
9030,152,"My stay at Blueberry Hill Cottage was the best of what Airbnb is about: Gracious hosts sharing their beautiful space. It was as private as could be, but they were right there if needed.

Everything about this little cottage fed my soul: just what I needed. It was near enough to businesses that I could fulfill my work obligations, but such a tree-top hideaway that I felt like I was way farther away up the mountains. Truth be told, I ditched much of my ""homework"" to give in to a mini-vacation on the sunny deck : )

As a non-pet person with allergies, I was a tiny bit worried, but no need: everything was SO clean and fresh, no hint of animals. And I like to cook while traveling. Though I didn't this time, this place has everything you would need to!

Special shoutout to the hot water and water pressure that made for epic showers (do bring your own amenities, though!)

Treat yourself to a truly convenient and lovely getaway here: I'm definitely plotting a return!"
9031,152,"Beautiful little cottage. Quiet, serene beautiful environment.
Jefferson was very helpful."
9032,152,No complaints. Beautiful place and very kind hosts
9033,152,Very nice play. The cottage is cute and comfortable and the whole experience was very enjoyable.
9034,152,"As a Professional Disc Golfer #14268, this place exceeds location to course beyond all my other stays.
Simply put, I’ve said it before…this place could be in a Bob Ross Painting : ).
The owners are numero uno…what a treat to chat with them face to face…and love the polar bears ; ).
This place is perfect for 1-2…Book It.
J."
9035,152,This was a repeat stay. The cottage will be our go to place whenever we visit our son's family. It is really comfortable & in a charming location.
9036,152,Great stay! No complaints
9037,152,"Loved our stay at the guest house again this time. Jeffrey and Deb are top notch hosts. And the place is one of the best we’ve ever stayed in. Clean, convenient, best value…and it smells so good. :). Thank you again and again."
9038,152,"The small charming cottage was just as described and perfectly suited to my needs, my desires and my expectations. Just what I was looking for -- specially quiet, independent, and extra pet friendly. For me, it would be the perfect place to hole up and write my books, with a nice isolated country road out back to walk along for breaks. I feel like one other reviewer who said their only hesitation in writing their glowing review is that too many others would come and fill up the reservation availability. I would go there again in a minute, life circumstances permitting."
9039,152,"The cottage was the perfect spot with easy access to the highway and downtown.
Everything was clean and the little extra things that were stocked in the kitchen was awesome. We cannot wait to come back in warmer weather to see the gardens"
9040,152,Felt right at home. Super comfortable bed
9041,152,"Jefferson and Deb were great hosts and the cottage was perfect for two plus a dog. You feel secluded in the woods but within minutes of the town. This is a perfect central location for exploring NC (Boone 40 min, Stone Mountain State Park 35 min, Appalachian Ski 50 min, Elkin 35 min). We were accommodated greatly and would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
9042,152,"As always, this is the perfect place for me when I go ""home"" to Wilkes! Jefferson is a great host!"
9043,152,"We enjoyed our stay so so much! We came here for our wedding weekend which occurred in the area and Deb and Jeff spoiled us! Thank you guys so much for your hospitality and kindness on this special weekend!

This place was perfect for the two of us and the pup! It’s so beautiful in this area, and this little Airbnb is tucked away from the owners house, so if you need something they are right there while also having plenty of your own privacy! We would 100% book this place again in a heartbeat."
9044,152,always a great stay.
9045,152,"Everything you need is right here! Deborah and Jefferson were very quickly communicative and thorough, and was a perfect quiet location in Wilkesboro. Located 40 minutes to Boone, an hour to Mooresville and Charlotte area, their place was wonderfully serene and just what is needed for time away. Would absolutely stay again!"
9046,152,"Treat yourself to this private cottage & peaceful garden in a lovely neighborhood. I enjoyed a chat with the personable hosts who were outside when I arrived. There is a full kitchen, couch and desk in the living room and a comfortable bed. There is a numeric code pad on the door for convenient private entry/exit. The washer & dryer are easily accessible in the “basement” of the cottage itself. I’ll definitely book this property for my next visit! Thank you so much!"
9047,152,Very clean and enjoyable cabin stay!
9048,152,"The only hard part about giving this a 5+ star rating is that it means others may book it solid, and we may not get it when we want it again! We loved everything about it. Communication, location, extras, it was excellent. One of the best we’ve ever stayed in. we will stay again and again!"
9049,152,"Thank you so much, Joanne. Please do return!"
9050,152,Awesome airbnb super close to downtown Wilkesboro. Cottage was super clean and comfortable. Grounds were gorgeous and made us feel like we were at an estate! Jefferson was available and welcoming. We'd love to make a return visit in the future!
9051,152,Great place. Great hosts.
9052,152,This cottage is a wonderful and peaceful place to stay. Very clean and comfortable.
9053,152,"I had a pleasure staying at Blueberry Hill Cottage. It was Joyful & Peaceful
I wanted to spend quite time and it was just perfect
Loved the location and the surrounding
Deborah & Jefferson were very kind"
9054,152,Great location! Very quiet and safe. Beautiful landscaping. We would stay here again.
9055,152,Nice place & kind people!
9056,152,"WONDERFUL PLACE TO STAY, VERY PEACEFUL AND RELAXING, WE REALLY ENJOYED SITTING ON THE FRONT PORCH AND WATCHING AND LISTENING TO ALL THE DIFFERENT BIRDS. WAS A GREAT STAY."
9057,152,"Great location for visiting Wilkesboro and the surrounding areas especially vineyards. Has everything you need to relax and enjoy nature just a few minutes from downtown. Clean, well supplied, and wonderful king size bed. Definitely a good value."
9058,152,Always a great visit.
9059,152,We had a most wonderful week at Blueberry Hill. The cottage is tucked away at the back of the property and is easily accessible but totally private. The cottage is spotlessly clean and comfortable and has everything you could possibly need. The king bed is super comfy and the large walk-in closet gave us a place to store all our luggage and “stuff”. There is a super laundry room downstairs. The location is great! Just a few miles to anything you need for shopping and restaurants and only 11 miles to Moravian Falls. We most definitely have this on our “most favorites” list and will be back again. Thanks Jefferson and Deborah! You were great hosts.
9060,152,"Blueberry Hill Cottage was AMAZING ❤️. Jefferson’s and Deb were incredibly attentive and accommodating and the property is gorgeous! Our stay for my family reunion was super cozy and peaceful.

Deb & Jefferson were able to accommodate our early check-in and the cottage saved several family members from a long drive just to change between reunion events.

The property is very tranquil - there was even a baby bird’s nest in one of the planters out back! So precious 😍.

100/10 totally recommend - especially if you appreciate nature."
9061,152,You were great guests and you will be welcomed anytime at Blueberry Hill Cottage!
9062,152,"Blueberry Hill Cottage is beautiful and it was perfect for my six-night stay. If I thought Jefferson and Deb would have me as a tenant, I would have been tempted to make my stay a permanent one! (Only halfway kidding!) I had a friend in town for the same event that brought me to Wilkesboro and she chose to stay at a local hotel. When she came to the cottage so that we could carpool to the festival we were attending, she agreed that I had made the FAR better choice. I had everything I needed. The bed was so huge and so comfortable that I think I could have had a family of strangers sharing it with me and I wouldn't have noticed that they were there. I slept like a baby. The neighborhood is extremely quiet except for the sounds of nature, the landscaping around the entire property is like Eden, the back deck was a respite after long, exhausting days. The hosts were available and we shared friendly texts but I didn't need one single thing that hadn't been provided and they gave me complete privacy which it made it seem as if the place were my own. I can only hope that they will have me back again next year!"
9063,152,Had a great stay at the cottage. The cottage and the yard were well kept. I took my dog with me and he had plenty of space to use the bathroom. Everything was as described.
9064,152,"Wonderful! Super clean, we had everything we needed for a week long stay and plenty of space for our belongings and two dogs. The property and the neighborhood are beautiful and convenient to everywhere we wanted to explore. Best mattress ever and great water pressure. The washer and dryer were a great bonus, as was the rear deck - we spent many relaxing hours there. We’ll be back! Jefferson and Deb really are excellent hosts. We had numerous thunderstorms during our stay and the Wi-Fi never wavered."
9065,152,Great place to stay.
9066,152,"Deb and Jefferson were great hosts, and they communicated propmtly throught my stay:) the cottage was perfect! The back porch at dawn with my coffee was delightful, with the birds right in front of you singing on the deck. Also, i took an adventurous walk, down the backside of the backyard property thru the right gate and through the brush out the gate (wear good tennis shoes, and bring your phone for gps for at the end of the road). There is a pathway that views farmland and rolling hills as far as the eye can see. Also, you will see deer and lots of rabbits. The bed was soooo comfortable. If you close the bedroom door, you will be amazed at the total silence--it was all perfect!"
9067,152,We would recommend this place to anyone visiting the area.
9068,152,Was a great place to stay. Will definitely stay again. Very beautiful setting.
9069,152,This little cottage is a great getaway for some peace and quiet. The landscaping is beautiful. Breakfast on the back porch each morning was fabulous. We so enjoyed the serenity it provided. Our four-legged fur baby had the run of the property which was fenced in to keep him safe. It was clean and very well maintained. Jefferson was available for communication and quite pleasant. The cottage is just as described in the listing. We enjoyed our time at this peaceful retreat.
9070,152,"Jefferson and Deb are incredible hosts. Their place is welcoming, comfortable and relaxing. We can’t wait to get back there."
9071,152,Blueberry Hill Cottage is wonderful and a great location!
9072,152,"Quiet, clean, and comfortable.
This will always be our choice when we come to the Wilkesboro area.
We loved the cottage and the beautiful property."
9073,152,Very nice accommodations and friendly host.
9074,152,This is a must stay. If you want some relaxing time in a beautiful setting. Then this would be perfect. The cottage is charming and very clean. I truly looked forward to coming back to relax each evening.
9075,152,"Adorable cottage in the back of a gated estate, surrounded by trees and the property backs up to a reserve. Very peaceful. Nice private back porch, comfortable bed, and seating out front on the porch. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!"
9076,152,We stayed at this cottage for a month and it was like “home sweet home” for us. Loved getting to know Deb and Jefferson and the dogs and exploring the property was lots of fun too! So many beautiful flowers and wildlife. Very private and secluded yet close to everything you could want!
9077,152,"Lovely location. Very comfortable, clean, and well set up. When the Wi-Fi glitched they were highly responsive and got everything right back up and running."
9078,152,Great little cottage that has everything you need! The hosts are super nice and accommodating!
9079,152,Very nice place
9080,152,"We absolutely loved Jefferson & Deb's cottage! It was cozy and had everything we needed in the well thought out space. There was plenty of room for the 2 of us and our 2 dogs and although we were sharing the grounds with the owners, we had privacy and quiet. My favorite spot was the back deck tucked in the woods with green space beyond. Jeff + Deb were wonderful and replied quickly when we had a question. So thankful that we had this opportunity - will definitely be back!"
9081,152,"A great space perfect for a long or short term stay! The space is clean, comfortable, and well equipped and Deb & Jefferson were excellent hosts."
9082,152,Great place to stay! Clean and cozy. Jefferson was a great host!
9083,152,.
9084,152,"Thanks, Mike. We always welcome suggestions and have adopted many of our guests' ideas. We love yours!"
9085,152,"Very kind hosts, and a lovely home!!! I highly recommend staying here!"
9086,152,Loved staying in this adorable cabin! It was just the right size for two. We cooked all our meals and the kitchen was easy to use. Hosts were communicative and very generous. The area gave us easy access to hiking and the blue ridge parkway. Would love to stay again!
9087,152,The property is beautiful and the cottage itself is quite cozy. It is a great location in a quiet neighborhood yet close to downtown. Deb and Jefferson are wonderful hosts and respond promptly. I would definitely stay again if back in the area!
9088,152,Great stay as always.
9089,152,"Blueberry Hills Cottage is the perfect location! It's private, quiet and was easy access to everything I wanted to do."
9090,152,"wonderful place to visit and the host is the most! Beautiful scenery and very tranquil for the ultimate relaxation experience in the woods but still close to town. We have been there twice and will return again and again. Wish we could bring it back with us. Love it to pieces. Terrie, Cocoa, Florida"
9091,152,"We thoroughly enjoyed our week at the cottage. Jefferson and Deb were delightful. Bed was super comfortable. Nice , quiet neighborhood to go for walks and walk our dog. Kitchen has all necessary appliances. We would definitely stay here again when we are back in this area!!"
9092,152,Check in was easy. Had everything we needed for our five day visit. A great stay and we hope to return again.
9093,152,We enjoyed our stay at Blueberry Cottage very much.
9094,152,Jeff’s place at Blueberry Hill is a gem. The cottage is on the back of his property in a quiet wooded setting. Very peaceful. Everything you need is at your fingertips in the cottage. Short drives to many of the vineyards in Yadkin Valley. Have stayed here twice and will do so again. Rick G.
9095,152,"What a wonderful place to stay! Quiet, private, peaceful, just perfect. And THE most comfortable bed we've ever slept on! Jefferson and Deb were amazing hosts. On the first morning there was an issue with the Keurig and they both came down and helped out so we could enjoy our precious morning coffee. The back deck is the perfect place to enjoy a nice cup of joe. We would absolutely stay here again!"
9096,152,Peace and quiet
9097,152,We came in for a long weekend to do some mountain biking. Cottage is in the perfect location and just the right size for the two of us. We enjoyed sitting on the back porch and watching the deer come thru. We also enjoyed meeting Jefferson and Deborah. Very nice hosts and recommend several restaurants to choose from. We will definitely be back. Rick & Denise
9098,152,"Cozy, quiet cottage that is very secure with the gated entrance. The property is buffered by the greenway so it is very peaceful; you only hear nature. Great back porch to sit out and enjoy your morning coffee."
9099,152,"Jeff and Deb's cottage is in a good convenient location in Wilkesboro, NC, with the feel of being in the woods. The cottage has everything to make your stay enjoyable and Jeff & Deb spoiled us with their great southern hospitality. The ability to bring our dog was a big plus for us. The cottage's yard was a great place for exploring. The cottage is very private even tho it is on the main house property.
The small towns of Wilkesboro and North Wilkesboro are located in a very historic area with nice main streets, good restaurants/food trucks (reasonably priced), small shops, and friendly people. There is also a mall area with a Walmart, chain restaurants, and grocery stores. The cottage is within 40 mins of Boone, NC, and the Appalachian Trail.
We spent two months in Blueberry Hill Cottage this summer to escape the heat of FL. We really enjoyed our stay and getting to know this part of NC."
9100,152,"We really enjoyed our stay! The house was comfortable and clean, and Jefferson and Deb were very easy to communicate with. Would recommend!"
9101,152,A 5 star cottage and hosts! I look forward to returning!
9102,152,"Beautiful location, just far enough from the hustle n bustle that you can relax and breathe but still able to make a quick trip to walmart if needed! Perfect for a couple. The only thing I will say, is if you’re particularly subjected to hay fever, pack some benadryl!"
9103,152,"At Blueberry Hill Cottage you'll find everything you need for a respite from the busy world. It is an oasis of peace surrounded by nature. If you want to go out, shopping, restaurants, etc are nearby. Or if you just want to soak up serenity & peacefulness, you're surrounded by it."
9104,152,"Look no further, you found the place. Private, perfect hosts. Deer in the front, deer in the back, cows mooing from the farm behind the trees, a turtle right by the front of the cottage as well as a little Finch sitting on about six eggs in a nest right next to front door...plentiful wildlife. My wife and I had the most amazing month-long stay at Jefferson's secluded cottage and also enjoyed walking with our dogs around the waterfalls and numerous other fun activities in the area. The cottage at Blueberry Hill is landscaped and decorated with the love and passion for detail that would make Better Homes & Garden magazines turn green with envy. Above everything was the phenomenal hospitality that Jefferson and Deborah showed us from day one and every day after. This is a truly blessed place, the Airbnb rating system does not provide the amount of stars that Jefferson's cottage at Blueberry Hill deserves!"
9105,152,"Jefferson’s Blueberry Hill cottage was set in a very nice neighborhood and was perfect for our three day visit to wine country. Jefferson was very responsive and communicated well. His place is pet friendly and the neighborhood allowed for easy dog walks. The wineries we visited were all within a short drive. Excellent experience, we highly recommend. Five stars!"
9106,152,"One of the best Airbnb experiences we’ve had. Lovely hosts, pet friendly, stocked pantry (with home grown organic food), central air, fast internet, front and back porches, kind and hospitable hosts...we’ll definitely be back, as they’re way out in the country yet a stone’s throw from downtown, perfectly situated for us to visit family members nearby."
9107,152,"Great location, Hosts and property."
9108,152,"This was our second stay at this beautiful property. We will return again and again because we have family in the area and it is so comfortable and convenient for everything we need to do.
Deb and Jefferson are awesome hosts and have anticipated just about every need for their guests.
If your travel brings you to Wilkesboro, we highly recommend a stay at Blueberry Hill Cottage."
9109,152,Jefferson and Deb's place was wonderful! it was great to have the opportunity to get out of the city and just spend some time in a quiet location. we enjoyed seeing the wildlife off the back porch every morning! their space had all the comforts of home and more.
9110,152,"Beautiful setting, very welcoming. Loved the comfort - just like home -and we love our home."
9111,152,Blueberry Hill is surrounded by nature but only a short drive from the shops and restaurants of Wilkesboro. The cottage is set up for easy living and the bed was perfect. Great support from the hosts for a minor dishwasher snafu. Bring a friend or come for solitude--a perfect place to enjoy North Carolina.
9112,152,"If you're looking for a small, quiet place to spend some time alone- this cottage is it. Easy to access, close to town, peaceful...it was a great place to spend the weekend!"
9113,152,Thanks for staying with us and thanks for your positive review! You are welcome back any time!
9114,152,The Blueberry Hill Cottage was perfect for a two week stay. The kitchen was well stocked with a lovely view at the sink. The bed was so very comfortable. We enjoyed the back deck and the front porch. It was a convenient location for exploring the region. The hosts provided useful information and were welcoming.
9115,152,"The cottage was perfect for our week in Wilkesboro. My boyfriend and I were able to work from home using the WiFi. Jefferson and Deb’s binder had great suggestions for places to explore in the area. The house itself was clean, well-stocked, and comfortable. I definitely recommend staying here."
9116,152,"The location is amazing, less than ten minutes to get to pretty much anything, 40 minutes to Boone, and plenty of outdoor activities nearby. Cozy space with privacy and we really enjoyed the back porch and the availability of the laundry facilities and the full size kitchen during our stay. Super peaceful, and my husband enjoyed being able to watch the Super Bowl from the cottage. Easy access and check-in and the hosts Deborah and Jefferson were easy to communicate with. Highly recommend this cottage as a sweet getaway with mountain feels but close to amenities."
9117,152,Thank you for your kind words. We are constantly trying to improve the cottage experience and hope it will be even better for you next time!
9118,152,This place is a great getaway. It's a mountain retreat with all the comforts of home.
9119,152,We really loved this place.
9120,152,"This place is a gem--as are the hosts! It's just the right size for a cozy stay. And even though it's in a neighborhood just adjacent to the main road, it's peaceful and quiet. As for amenities, my daughter and I spent Thanksgiving here, and we had everything we needed to cook a fine feast. When not stuffing ourselves, the couch was comfy for watching holiday movies on the big flat-screen or surfing holidays sales with the strong wifi signal. And the back deck was a special treat--we sat in the sun both days and enjoyed the nature around us, including watching a young buck wander by one day and listening to the owls each evening. The water pressure in the shower was great, and the mattress on the king bed was divine! We're so happy we found this place and definitely recommend it."
9121,152,Thanks so much for your kind words. We are grateful that you chose us for your getaway.
9122,152,"If you’re looking at this listing and are thinking that it looks adorable (like I did), I can tell you that it is 100% as precious in person. It has a great little kitchen, comfy sofa and bed, and just a great peaceful and cozy atmosphere. I’m so glad I stayed here for 3 nights instead of in a hotel!"
9123,152,The stay was very beautiful and a peaceful experience for us. The cottage is surrounded by a lot of greenery. We loved sitting on the backporch listening to the birds and the occasional cow. Easily accessible and a quick trip into town. Blueberry picking season is in August!
9124,152,"Our stay at Blueberry Hill Cottage was great! Small home perfect for two, Jefferson and his wife are very friendly but also respect your privacy. Can’t say enough good things about our stay and are looking forward to coming back!"
9125,152,Warm cozy and beautiful place!! Thank you hosts!!
9126,152,Lovely property and conveniently located off the highway. If you want peace and quiet this is the place for you.
9127,155,"Super clean place!
Beautiful location. This was perfect place to just relax while listening to the river. The host were very fast at responding to any message sent and great communicators. I wish I could live here. I will definitely be back. We enjoyed a great hike to see the waterfalls at South Mountain Park. Much needed relaxation and perfect place to stay. Thanks so much for allowing us to use your place. Highly recommend"
9128,155,Wonderful place to stay! If you are looking to escape for a trip away “unplugged” this is your spot. You truly feel in touch with nature with the scenery and babbling river right in your back yard. The cell phone service is spotty and the internet is a bit limited as advertised due to the remote location but if you are trying to get away from it all then nothing beats this place. The owners are fantastic hosts and go above and beyond to ensure a great stay!
9129,155,Seriously spectacular! We can’t wait to stay again in the future.
9130,155,"Absolutely love this place. It’s secluded, super clean and mostly peaceful. The description of the location is 100% accurate. The internet is spotty as mentioned but there’s plenty to do around. I stayed at the upper level which is where I would recommend to stay if possible because of the wrap around deck."
9131,155,Beautiful spot in the river as a base for hiking. We especially loved the firepit at night and the gas fireplace in the living room!
9132,155,"Amazing place, highly recommend, wonderful views. The place is very comfortable, spotless kitchen and bathrooms."
9133,155,Our family loves staying here
9134,155,Private getaway with a fantastic view of the creek during the winter. We enjoyed the bon fire and wrap around deck. The gas logs made the den plenty warm. We had everything we need and appreciated the helpful fishing recommendations from Janice and Phillips- great hosts! We're already thinking of a return visit for both units.
9135,155,it was really nice and quiet place 😌
9136,155,"Peaceful, enjoyable, comfortable! I loved the sound of the river right behind the house. The bed was comfortable and the whole spot was charming overall. Thank you!"
9137,155,"Great price, privacy, nature& outdoor experience, moon & star gazing, river sitting, fireplace, fire pit relaxing, & comfortable! Refresh your soul while doing all the peaceful, cozy things offered here, literally! Janice was very quick to help via text or phone call. It is straightforward to find by the directions provided by them, and the drive down was beautiful. Getting out of the vehicle, hearing the river, and seeing nature all around it is quite the therapeutic environment. It is the coziest little house & the sound of the river immediately captured my attention. The porch is so big and has so many seating areas all around to view the gorgeous surroundings. They had very nice little treats and hot drinks for the Keurig! The bed was comfortable with options of pillows. Spotless, books to choose from, movies, and very well decorated for the Christmas season! Must experience this place of peace & rest to “get the full picture”. It is by far more than I can describe in a few words."
9138,155,We absolutely loved everything about this rental. The coffee/tea/snack station was especially appreciated. Having separate towels for our poodles was so thoughtful. The wrap around porch is amazing. We would love to come back here in the future!!
9139,155,"We had a wonderful time! The location is fantastic and everything we hoped for. Beautiful, peaceful, and a great family place. We had so much fun “turning down the volume” of the world and enjoying the quiet, serene, and simple pleasures of being together as a family. Sitting around the fire, telling ghost stores, jokes, roasting marshmallows. The river and Mountain View’s are awesome. Great hiking and all the amenities you could ask for. Really… the place feels like home. I had the pleasure of talking with Phil (one of the owners) as he was dropping off a load of firewood. Great guy and we hit it off immediately, and he gave me some great insight to the area. The nearby orchard is a must stop. Just good, decent people all around. We look forward to visiting again."
9140,155,"Great place, beautiful and peaceful."
9141,155,"Janice and Phillip’s home overlooking the Henry River was perfect! It is exactly as described and better. Although it’s a duplex, it is very private and quiet. We met the family below once when we walked down to the river and then the only other time was on the trail hiking up to High Shoals Falls! The covered porch was amazing! It was so nice to be able to sit and look at and listen to the river. We would definitely stay here again if we visit the area."
9142,155,"This place is a nice little gem for someone who wants to have privacy and seclusion but also not be too far from town as some mountain places tend to be. The location cannot be beat and its perfect for a nice quiet getaway. The home was very clean, spacious, kitchen was well stocked and they even supplied a few toiletries incase you had forgot anything. The firepit on the river is almost breathtaking. One day after hiking nearby trails in South Mountain State Park we sat by the fire with hot dogs & marshmallow's for at least 5 or 6 hours. The view and hearing the river running over the rocks is a sound that never gets old. For people worrying about other renters being below you, that was not an issue for us. We seen cars in the driveway but never seen or heard the other guest in the two days we were there. Thank you Janice & Phillip as you have an amazing place and thank you for the great communication! We will be back in the future!"
9143,155,A beautiful spot and close to town.
9144,155,"Oustanding. Very spacious, perfectly cleaned, tons of information on activities in the area. Very convenient to South Mountain State Park. Secluded little spot, right on the river, but just a few minutes away from Morganton."
9145,155,They stay was wonderful! Location is amazing. Very clean and the host are amazing!
9146,155,Great place. Just a little to remote for us.
9147,155,"Wow Paul! I hate that you felt you needed to rate our location a 3 simply because it was too remote for you. It is clearly described and listed as at the end of a paved road 10 minutes from town. There are even aerial pictures included in our listing. Thanks for the 5 ratings on cleanliness, check in and communication. We made every effort to be accurate. We hope our future guests will read that no other guest felt our location was a negative or inaccurately described."
9148,155,Beautiful home in a beautiful and peaceful setting. We were able to unwind and fully relax on our stay.
9149,155,"Incredibly cozy home with great activities just steps from the front door - hiking, fishing, exploring, walking through the creek and the ability to relax. It was exactly what our family needed to celebrate a birthday and reset."
9150,155,peace and tranquility
9151,155,"South Mountains on the Henry River is just far enough off the beaten path that it provides a peaceful, wooded setting while still being close enough to Morganton for restaurants and groceries and close to plenty of outdoor hiking options. As other reviewers have said, the property was super clean and well-maintained. This is NOT a worn out, cob-webby cabin on the river, but rather a comfortable and spacious home that happens to be situated on a pretty stretch of river. We had everything we needed for an enjoyable, relaxing weekend. Just sitting on the deck taking in the view and listening to the sounds of nature was a pleasure. Highly recommend Janice and Plillip's place if you plan to stay in the area."
9152,155,"Do not pass on this rental. Nestled in what feels like a forest, the location is absolutely stunning. The house is large & spacious, comfortable & quiet.
The hosts are phenomenal, with excellent communications, very attentive to our having a positive experience. If we're ever back in the area, this will be our first and only choice."
9153,155,Great location on the water. Very clean.
9154,155,"We had a wonderful stay at Janice & Phillip’s peaceful retreat! We loved being surrounded by nature yet it was just a short drive to shops and I-40. The home was squeaky clean, well appointed and very comfortable. We enjoyed our morning coffee on the wrap around porch while listening to the sounds of the creek below and the birds.
We are so happy to have found this little slice of heaven and can’t wait to visit again."
9155,155,"This is the cutest place for a small family or couple, plenty of room, the kitchen is stocked with everything needed for a nice meal. The bathrooms are stocked and clean. The outside areas are beautifully kept. The bed is a bit tall for anyone on the shorter side but it made for a good laugh and once in the bed it is beyond comfortable! Will plan to come back in the future!"
9156,155,"We very much enjoyed our stay at this house. The house was clean, and there was even a stack of timber and logs in the fire pit, just waiting to be lit. The stream behind the house was beautiful, and included a deep swimming hole. The most notable part of this house, though, is the responsiveness of the owners. We had a couple of requests during the week and they were very responsive. They live right down the road and clearly take pride in this house and in making their guests feel at home. All in all, it was a great week."
9157,155,Thank you so much for your kind words. We are so glad you enjoyed your visit. We actually live about a half hour away which gives our guests plenty of privacy but do take great pride in keeping the area nice for our long term renters and short term guests.
9158,155,I booked a trip for my Dad’s 64th birthday and he had an amazing time here. The quality of the home and communication between the host and my family were phenomenal. We will be coming back
9159,155,What an amazing place to stay. Very clean an well taken care of. The sound of running water from the stream in the back would help to calm all nerves. I will be planning to use this place again when I am in need of a quiet get away. There is a wonderful farmers market on Saturday and conveniently located to everything you could need.
9160,155,"This was the perfect spot for a quick, relaxing trip! The creek is such a lovely perk to sit in and enjoy the beautiful scenery. Cannot recommend enough! Will definitely be returning for more weekend getaways!"
9161,155,"The location was beautiful. Very quiet and peaceful, it was just what my husband and I needed. We had the upper level which was perfect for us and our pupper. The upper deck is gated so he was able to run around the deck without his leash.

The bed is REALLY high but there is a step stool by the bed to step up on. The only changes I would make would be to fence in the patio area downstairs (since the place is pet friendly) and switch the 2 TVs. The one in the bedroom is much larger than the one in the living room.

Janice was very easy to work with and very responsive when I had questions. Great weekend!!"
9162,155,This was my 4th trip to this Airbnb. That says enough lol ❤️
9163,155,"As always, very peaceful and quiet with abundant nature all around.

Perfect for a weekend getaway or a digital detox to unplug.

Will definitely be coming back."
9164,155,Awesome place to stay and relax. You wont need to go anywhere everything you need is right here. Easy to get to only located a few miles off of 40. We will differently be back.
9165,155,"We will definitely be back. Overall great experience. The location is private and peaceful. Its clean, the beds are comfy, the kitchen is stocked- no complaints. Janice & Phillip are great host. Excellent communication. My daughter loved it so much, She wants to trade our beach vacation for the river. We saw a mommy elk and babies. It caught us off guard at first. I didn't expect them to just walk out of the woods near us like ""Hey!"" The Chinese restaurant (Chen's?) next to Food Lion was delicious. Thank you!!!"
9166,155,Had a fantastic time at Janice & Phillip’s home. We will return again!
9167,155,Beautiful spot! House was as described. At the end of the road the little path to the big rocks and swimming spot were great! Loved that we were able to bring our dog and have him enjoy splashing in the creek as well! Place was very clean and even though pets are allowed would never know. Very private and peaceful. Internet wasn’t very reliable but that was made clear in the description so we were already expecting that. It worked well enough for web browsing and we had some cell service to make calls if needed. Close to town of Morganton for any needs. Would recommend staying if you’re looking for a place to unwind and relax yet close to town!
9168,155,"Fantastic spot. Make sure you walk down the trail to the swimming area, it is the perfect spot for families."
9169,155,Most peaceful place ever.
9170,155,Everything stated in the Airbnb was there! Quite and nice area to relax.
9171,155,"This AirBnB property was perfect for us. The mapped location was secluded enough for privacy and a quiet vacation, yet it is not far to grocery, hiking venues, good restaurants and shopping . We are Verizon and found phone signals tough inside the cabin, but improved when we stepped out the front door and walked in front of the porch. The trout stream running behind the cabin really adds to the ambiance, we sat by it often, day and evening. My hubs enjoyed the hammock on the huge upper deck, trying to read there, but fell alseep everytime! The other comments we read about the home being well stocked are true. It's probably the best well-stocked AirBnB we have rented, even finding a pair of reading glasses in a kitchen drawer. There were natural walking sticks to grab if you forget yours (hmmmm, who would do that, right?!!), plenty of kindling and wood for the fire pits. The small residential neighborhood you drive into is also quiet, only about a dozen homes on large parcels and the cabin is tucked in the back away from the other homes after at least 1/4 mile+ drive. We appreciated the paved road to it because we have rented mountain cabins in the Blue Ridge area with roads that are not paved and are steep, making access a bit daunting when you come from flatlands, as we do. There is a ton of parking for the top unit, which is where we stayed for 4 nights. For 2 of those nights there were renters in the bottom unit and though we did meet them, we never heard anything from the unit below during our stay. We hiked the nearby South Mountains park (maps in cabin and a very informative trail website) on easy and moderate trails and found it to be excellent. We are novice hikers. One of the easy trails, the River Trail, runs along the Jacob Fork River and we think it's a beautiful, treed, ""don't miss"" trail no matter your hiking level. We also discovered an urban trail and park in Morganton that is very good for walking, The Morganton Greenway System. It's entirely paved and very shady, located on the Catawba River, runs approx 7 miles in loops with outdoor exercise areas along the way. There is a restuarant/bar located right on the walking trail we found to be very good, Town Tavern. Family in the area also recommended Carolina Smoked Barbeque and Copper Still. We enjoyed a very, almost too harty, meal there! We also enjoyed 3 of the Morganton breweries. The local guide book the hosts have compiled for the cabin was a big assistance to what we did while in the Morganton area. Janice and Phillip are quickly responsive to questions before and during your stay. We will definatly re-book this AirBnB again when in the area!"
9172,155,❤️❤️ one of our favorite airbnbs!
9173,155,Absolute gem!!! So peaceful and quite but close to food and highway.
9174,155,"If you love rivers, porches, outdoor space, and fire pits look no further! Plus you get to come inside to a beautiful house after playing in the river."
9175,155,Great place highly recommended for a nice mountain hide-away/get-away with the Henry River right in your backyard 👍
9176,155,Phenomenal stay! Everything from the host to the cleanliness down to the location is absolutely perfect!! Already checking my calendar to see when we can return for some R&R!!! Highly recommend!!!
9177,155,"The property was just as described. Even though there is a unit on lower level, it is still very private. Beautiful view of the creek and a very quiet area."
9178,155,"Wow, This place was fantastic! We really enjoyed staying here, it was just beautiful.
we were about 20 minutes from South Mountain State Park and 40 from Lake James. The grocery store it was about 10 minutes away, but you really feel like you are in the mountains with this house! The house was very clean, comfortable bed and nice appliances. It was fully stocked and had everything we needed. It has a really cool wrap around porch and sun porch. There were people staying downstairs but swear we didn’t hear a peep. The stream looked shallow and clear, and we really want to come back in the summer for swimming and campfires!"
9179,155,Lovely home in a beautiful setting. Hear the rush of the river from this relaxing wrap around porch!
9180,155,peaceful and quiet place so clean and beautiful.
9181,155,Great place to relax and be surrounded by nature! We would definitely visit again!
9182,155,This place is really COOL!!! And the way it’s set up is really private!!! Wish it was summer so we could enjoy the river in the back. Who knew there was so much to do around a place called morgonton!!! They have an alpine mountain coaster 30 miles on a ski lodge!!!! And if you like hiking there are many places near by with waterfalls. This place has everything you need for a vacation.
9183,155,"Look NO FURTHER! Perfect place to enjoy nature. We had a wonderful three-night stay (wish we could’ve stayed for several more!). Peaceful, comfortable, pet-friendly home located right on the Henry River in Morganton, NC. The hosts communication level was perfect, the home had EVERYTHING we needed & wanted, we will definitely come back. Oh!!! And look up at the stars at night, aaaamaaazing! Thank you, Janice & Phillip."
9184,155,Janice and Phillip are gracious hosts. We enjoyed this peaceful stay on their property immensely and will treasure the memories our family made on this trip.
9185,155,"10 out of 10 would recommend to a friend!! We had a very good time, very clean also. Close to towns and outdoors adventures."
9186,155,"This property is a hidden gem. Everything was more than I expected. Had my concerns about it being a duplex, but no problem at all. Very spacious, furniture and bed comfortable, outside decking and porch was wonderful. Location, if you like peaceful and full of nature, perfect, but still close to stores and highway. Janice was wonderful to work with, very accommodating. We will be rescheduling into this property."
9187,155,This is a beautiful and peaceful home along on the Henry river. We absolutely loved staying here - very serene and a great location. We'll be back!
9188,155,"This is a fantastic spot! Quiet and beautiful. Lots of extras in the house such as towels, hairdryer, and coffee.
The fire pit is incredible.
Janice and Phillip are wonderful!"
9189,155,"We really don’t want to say how awesome this place is…it will become hard to get a reservation when we’re in Morganton! The porch is a perfect place to sit and watch the sunset with great views of the river, field, and ridge. The house was super comfortable for the two of us and in almost 30 years of traveling I have never seen my husband hate to leave a place so much he may have “got something in my eye”."
9190,155,"QUIET - that's what this place has in spades. No traffic noise, no sirens, no airplanes - pure solitude, with a view/sounds of the soothing stream/river. The upstairs is so spacious and not overly-furnished. Kitchen is well designed, suitably equipped (coffee+coffee maker, toaster, microwave,etc), sturdy/firm sofa/seating, and easy loading/unloading right at front door. Would love to return when things are blooming in spring, summer & autumn leaves turning. Next time would stay longer to take advantage of the fire pit and enjoy the river. (Don't know what the rules are for fishing or even wading in the water?) What a beautiful place with the wrap-around decks."
9191,155,"Fabulous escape! Beautiful! Janice and Phillip were wonderful and the place is very clean!
Great fire pit and porch!"
9192,156,"Our stay at The Twig was the perfect escape from Chicago. Perched on top of a hill, it was a serene and secluded getaway surrounded by a picturesque forest and mountain views. The tiny home was just the right size for my partner, myself, and our small dog. We made good use of the tub after long days hiking—even came in handy for our muddy pup. Though, our favorite feature was the windows— especially in the misty morning waking up to the sun rise. The plot had ample space for our dog to run around while we sat by the fire pit. Moreover, the surrounding forest had plenty of dead branches for the fire and even had a few morels! When we weren’t hiking , we really enjoyed visiting the nearby town of Sylva for coffee at White Moon and meals at some of our favorite restaurants in Asheville. This was our second stay with Abbey and Ethan—we were glad to see their responsiveness and thoughtful design carried over into multiple homes. Highly recommend the Twig for any city dweller."
9193,156,The Twig was absolutely perfect for our anniversary getaway! The space was clean and super cute and the hosts were very helpful and responsive if we needed them. We will definitely be back!
9194,156,Abby and Ethan have done a great job with their stellar cottage. The cottage space is super cozy and has all you need. The wooded views made time around the fire pit exceptional. Worth your time to visit.
9195,156,"We had a fantastic time at the twig! Highly recommend a long soak in the tub and then a drive on the parkway, and finish up the night with a lovely dinner in Waynesville at the sweet onion!"
9196,156,"First off, I'd like to thank Ethan and Abby for a wonderful place to stay! They were quick to respond to all of my questions and were super helpful. I was worried at first about the drive up the mountain because of other reviews. I drive a small kia soul and had no issues getting up and down the driveway even when it had rained all day. The tiny home itself is
breathtaking. Simple and tasteful. I stayed for 2 nights and took a bath about 5 times because, oh my goodness! Took my pups up the hill behind the home during a break in the rain and could see all the mountain tops. Beware of the briars. If you are looking for a peaceful, quiet, and secluded place. Look no further!"
9197,156,Abby and Ethan’s stay was perfect!
9198,156,"This place was GORGEOUS! The only critique would be that the tub wasn’t very functional, as you can only fit one small person. In a hiking community a shower would be preferred. However, the views and peaceful atmosphere was definitely worth it!"
9199,156,Beautiful. Authentic. Very peaceful place. Bathtub was amazing . Everything we dreamed.
9200,156,The Twig was the perfect place for my solo hiking trip. I loved that my pup was able to tag along too. The place is cozy and looks just like the listing. Abby and Ethan were great hosts and communicated with me throughout the stay. The tiny home was clean and stocked with all the essentials. I read previous reviews and brought along my own firewood and had some movies downloaded to my Netflix beforehand. Downtown Sylva was close by and had some really cool breweries and a cute town to walk through. I look forward to checking out the hosts other locations.
9201,156,"Book it!!

Very peaceful stay—-very private. Loved the soaking tub and views from all the windows.

Grab food on your way in—-once you get there you won’t want to leave.

Driveway is a bit intimidating but I made it up just fine"
9202,156,"We really enjoyed our stay. We had our dog with us, and he was able to run around due to it being private and quiet. We definitely recommend, and we will look forward to our next visit!"
9203,156,"This place and the hosts are 10/10. Suggestions for the guests is to bring wood just in case wood is wet there. Also maybe lighter fluid or some kind of fire starter supplies. Download movies from Netflix and such so you can watch the tv or airplay.
The place was clean and well stocked with supplies which was amazing. They have lots of blankets. The chairs out there have a cup holder that will hold your wine which is super cool. It is so serene and peaceful with no one around. The mountain view is spectacular. There is a creek that is wonderful to see. The hosts picked a perfect location to put the tiny house. They are very communicative."
9204,156,"The Twig was a peaceful getaway. Amenities, surroundings, etc. were exactly as described or pictured in the listing. A big selling point is the bath and my only complaint is the absence of a shower. The tub has a detachable shower head, but there is not a curtain to prevent spraying water everywhere if standing. We were unable to use the TV due to lack of Wifi and difficulty connecting personal hotspot, but this was not important. We felt comfortable letting our 1 year old lab wander because of the seclusion. We loved being able to see the mountains through the trees during our winter stay, and I can only image what it looks like surrounded by green in the summer. We spent most of our time hiking off the BRP, which was a 15 minute drive, and stopped briefly in Sylva for coffee and to browse an outdoor store and bookstore. The hosts were communicative and kind."
9205,156,beautiful space and perfect for getting away from it all!
9206,156,The Twig is great. Very peaceful with awesome views in the winter. Close to hiking and the BRP but also in a perfect location to explore Sylva and Waynesville. We also really enjoyed being able to bring the pup!
9207,156,Beautiful place and surroundings. Needed to use hotspot from phone for tv due to no Wi-Fi but luckily still had service. Really enjoyed the town of Sylva and was an easy drive to Asheville and surrounding areas. Pretty steep driveway but had no problems with a RWD sedan.
9208,156,"This cute little cabin made for a quiet, relaxing mountain weekend! We thought the amenities were amazing and especially loved the fire pit and tub! We already talked about booking again in the future. 10/10 would recommend!"
9209,156,"The Twig is a very cute and cozy stop convientally located for the Blue Ridge Parkway, or a day trip into Great Smoky Mountains National Park or Asheville.
We ran into issues with hot water during our stay, but it was addressed and it would be fun to stay in one of the other Nordic & Spruce tiny homes hosted by Abby and Ethan in NC!
** If you want to try a super yummy Mexican restaurant, try La Poblana - great for a post-hike burrito! We also enjoyed White Moon Coffee in Sylva, and exploring a few downtown bookstores.
Bring a pair of rain boots - the parking area is squishy when it’s wet."
9210,156,"This was a great little getaway. Very neat tiny home and such a beautiful area! Also, I recommend going to check out the downtown area of Sylva, which has plenty of food options and a few breweries."
9211,156,"We loved this tiny house it was peaceful and quiet. Although we were looking forward to taking a bath in the nice tub the most but during our stay, we had no hot water. The following morning, we had no running water. It was cold outside, but it was definitely a bummer."
9212,156,Very good
9213,156,"Really peaceful and quiet, great location to check out from the day to day."
9214,156,"We had a great time. However, pipes were frozen our first night there and we had no water. They sent someone to fix the next day and refunded us for the first night."
9215,156,This place was amazing! We highly recommend going in the winter while it is snowing. It makes the location feel magical! We had an amazing experience with Abby and Ethan and their willingness to be so accommodating. We are already planning our next trip for the summer! If you get the chance to stay at this location it really is the perfect place to unplug from the world and have some one on one time!
9216,156,"Great spot for a quick romantic getaway! The hosts are really friendly and communicative; we met two friendly dogs who ran up to say hi (much love to randy and disco). The road up is steep so 4WD or AWD is suggested. The interior was great; quaint but unique. The bed is super comfy, the bath is great and the natural light from the windows is great. 10/10 would recommend and stay again!"
9217,156,A great weekend getaway! Definitely recommend if you need a break from every day life. I would come back in the future!
9218,156,Abby and Ethan were very accommodating. The place looked just like the photos. It was very cozy and comfortable!
9219,156,"Very fun weekend we had, Abby and Ethan were very responsive. Overall would go back!"
9220,156,We really enjoyed our mountain getaway! We came during the coldest weekend and a winter storm and Abby & Ethan were very responsive to help with all of our questions!
9221,156,The Twig was a peaceful and tucked away cabin and everything you need for a mountain get away. Downtown Sylva is close for take out and there is a small functional kitchen in the tiny home. Overall we had a wonderful relaxing stay! The hosts were communicative and responded quickly.
9222,156,Beautiful home on a peaceful and private property surrounded by mountains. Felt surprisingly spacious. The bed was very comfortable and loved the bathtub. You cannot beat the location being 10 minutes from Blue Ridge Parkway access and 35 minutes from Great Smoky Mountain National Park. We loved our stay here!
9223,156,Great stay. Very private and new. Clean and loved our stay!
9224,156,"We loved our stay! This was the perfect, quiet, cozy spot for a getaway for two. It’s a beautiful tiny house with peaceful surroundings. We enjoyed time by the fireplace too. Abby and Ethan were super responsive."
9225,156,"Great stay at a cute little tiny house. Directions very accurate. I was glad to have AWD going up the driveway while it was raining, but you could probably make it without AWD. Very close to Sylva. Don’t miss innovation brewing!"
9226,156,"Me and my partner enjoyed our stay at Leisr’s place. The only two issues we had were the linen were not 100% clean (had dog hair/human hair all over the bed) and the hot water ran out fairly quickly. Other than that, the location was private and it was really cozy."
9227,156,We absolutely loved our stay and are looking forward to booking again!
9228,156,"We loved our stay at this cabin! It’s so nicely finished and was more spacious than we expected. Bed was super comfy, the whole thing is a cozy vibe."
9229,156,Moving from fl to Ohio and stopped for the night was amazing wil be back and will check out all the other ones they have
9230,156,"I booked this cabin for my birthday I was looking for a quiet place for a romantic getaway but at the same time enjoy some skiing which is 27 minutes to cataloochee ski area the place is beautiful and as described. The host were very communicative, the place is clean. Overall if you’re looking for the feeling of a relaxing and quiet atmosphere this is the one for you! Just keep in mind that the place is situated in a mountain"
9231,156,Wonderful little tiny home. The tub was very relaxing and everything was clean. Great communication and clear instructions for arrival/check out. Would definitely stay again if we are ever back out this way!
9232,156,This is the perfect spot for a couple’s getaway! Such a visually beautiful spot that has everything you need for a cozy stay. We brought our pup and he had the best time running around! Get prepared for friends to ask you to send the listing after you post about your stay!
9233,156,Great place! Unfortunately the hot water heater was not working during our stay but the hosts responded quickly and compensated us for the inconvenience and i am convinced it will be fixed by the next visit. Couldn’t be happier with the location and the resolution to the problem.
9234,156,"We felt right at home in this little cabin. The bed was so comfy, communication was great and we will definitely be back. It was so dreamy!"
9235,156,Beautiful place in a great location. We really enjoyed the peaceful spot with all the essentials.
9236,156,Beautiful and cozy place to stay. Great host who was very responsive. Would definitely book again
9237,156,Beautiful remote and quiet location. Perfect place to unplug.
9238,156,"Tiny house is amazing!! Perfect for a solo or couple's getaway.

Has everything you need to enjoy some relaxation while connecting with nature.

Couple things I would suggest:

Try to check in before night time as the drive up is quite daunting.

If you go during the winter season, bring an extra blanket or heater.

Drip the water at night to avoid frozen pipes."
9239,156,"Very cute place, loved the location and decor!"
9240,156,amazing place!
9241,156,This stay was amazing!!! The space was perfect from the inside to the views! I’ll definitely stay here again. The road to the home can be scary if you drive up at night for the first time.
9242,156,This was a great place for the night stay we had in mind. It was about 10 minutes or so from downtown Sylva and we could really take in the nature sitting around the chiminea at night. We had no issues with our stay and the host were responsive throughout.
9243,156,"This place is absolutely amazing! Centrally located to multiple towns/activities! Home was super clean, had everything needed for a pleasant stay! Got a special visit from Disco and Randy (you'll have to visit to find out who they are!) Home was secluded near the top of the mountain, if felt like we were in the middle of nowhere which was perfect! Thanks Abby and Ethan, we will definitely be back!"
9244,156,This place is incredible! Not to far from Sylva! Beautiful night sky! Perfect spot for a weekend getaway!
9245,156,I enjoyed my stay in this place I definitely recommend it .
9246,156,great location!! clean and warm place. 20 minutes to one of the highest peaks in the Appalachians
9247,156,We really enjoyed our weekend at The Twig. We were the first people to stay there and it is the perfect place for a couple’s getaway. Very private and secluded. The bed was very comfortable and it was nicely decorated. Excellent communication with the host. They were very prompt in answering any of our questions. We would definitely stay there again!
9248,159,Great place! Perfect retreat to reset and relax.
9249,159,I would have thought with it being in the 50’s the owner would have heat going. It was extremely cold when I came in and I actually had to turn on the oven and open the oven door to warm up the place. The hot water didn’t last long enough to even finish my shower. Even though I was told everyone there knew the parking was assigned I came back to someone parked in the guest spot. I am glad it was only me because if there had been another vehicle we wouldn’t have had anywhere to park it.
9250,159,Small one bedroom clean apartment with a nice view of the water. Angela was very accommodating when are plans changed.
9251,159,We were in town visiting family that lived close by. The apartment had everything you could need. It was perfect for our purpose.
9252,159,"Comfortable, clean and exactly as advertised. Will stay here again when we return."
9253,159,Great place! Super cute and clean. I would definitely stay again.
9254,159,Easy check in with lock box key. The place was clean. Loved the location on the sound. I only went to the beach when I first arrived because it was a one night stay so not sure about walkable distance but the pool and dock were very nice! Great for a couple or even a small girls trip of 2-3.
9255,159,Great place in a beautiful location. Our only regret is that we only stayed one night.
9256,159,Bogue Banks Retreat was a relaxing getaway with great waterfront views. The place is comfortable with a well equipped kitchen.
9257,159,"Great stay! The pool was lovely, perfect size, sound was beautiful for sunrise and sets! Cute and cozy! Would definitely book again just wouldn’t book for a full family of 5 cause it’s a little smaller for my personal liking with a 11, 7 and 3 year old lol if you know you know! But for a private get away for me and my mom or me and my husband yes I would absolutely book again! She was so kind, very fast on replying and very helpful with everything. The house had all we needed, the beach was very close, close enough to walk, dollar general also very close and restaurants. 15-20 mins to Emerald Isle or morehead. Beautiful place and friendly host! Loved it all around other then the space not feeling like enough for a family of 5…."
9258,159,"Great location and a beautiful, clean place to stay. We were really impressed by how lovely the room was and felt very at home thanks to amenities like the dishes and the sofa. The bed and shower were nice, too."
9259,159,Great stay but shortened due to the hurricane.
9260,159,Cozy spot on the Sound. Everything we needed for a comfortable stay was provided. Owner is very responsive to questions.
9261,159,"This place is absolutely fantastic!
Great location, super clean and Angela is easy to reach."
9262,159,"Adorable clean place, the private-ish pool is probably the best part. Walking distance to several restaurants too. It’s about a 10-15 minute walk to a clear path to the beach, that’s the only thing I didn’t particularly like"
9263,159,Angela was great the home was great. 10 out of 10 would recommend.
9264,159,Bogue Banks was the perfect get away! We enjoy our quick stay. Super convenient to both Atlantic Beach and Emerald Isle. Personal touches throughout the home with an amazing view. We will be back again!
9265,159,"She has a lovely home, and it's a fantastic location. It's a 4 minute drive to a public access beach site, about 10 minutes from the NC Aquarium, and there's a great playground in the area too."
9266,159,Great stay! Will try to stay here again the next time I go to the beach
9267,159,Beautiful place right on the sound. Private dock and pool.
9268,159,Beautiful apartment with a gorgeous view of Bogue Sound! Our stay was so relaxing!
9269,159,This is my second time booking Angela’s place. It’s perfect!
9270,159,"Had the absolute best time, wish we would have stayed longer. View was amazing, very close to a view restaurants and could have sat on the dock all day long. Definitely can’t go wrong for staying here!"
9271,159,"We enjoyed every second of our stay at Angela's house! The pool was definitely the highlight of our day :) The view is great, the location is great! Kids were soo happy!"
9272,159,Angela's apartment is really sweet and cosy! You can easily spend time there relaxing and forgetting all stress.
9273,159,Angela is a gracious host. We had everything we needed for a wonderful stay. Thank you for all the towels! Those came in handy for use of the backyard pool and our excursions to Fort Macon beach and Indian beach with access not too far from the house. My husband spent a lot of time fishing from the pier while I relaxed with a book. Restaurants are just down the street but the kitchen was up-fitted for cooking at home too. We had a great time!
9274,159,Angela is amazing and her place is amazing as well. The view from the dock was beautiful. A short walk to the marina and a bunch of restaurants was perfect. The Anchor Drafthouse had some great pizza and atmosphere. We will definitely be back. My family loved the stay here.
9275,159,My husband & I was just there celebrating our honeymoon & Angela’s house was amazing!! super cute & perfect for the both of us!!
9276,159,"Beautiful, well kept home with a lovely view of the sound. Pool was a great bonus!!"
9277,159,A great place with close beach access and great local restaurants. Angela is a great host and provides everything you need to have a fun and relaxing stay.
9278,159,"great location, clean, cute, friendly, the pool was great! 10/10 highly recommend"
9279,159,"Perfect stop along the way to Florida. There was close access to the beach and the view of the bay was wonderful. The bed was so cozy, it was like I was sleeping on a cloud. Highly recommend staying here."
9280,159,Angela was great at answering our questions! Great location and east beach access. Also awesome restaurants to eat at in walking distance from the house.
9281,159,"Such a beautiful and spectacular place! Everything was wonderful! Clean place, beautiful view day and night, perfect pool (our favorite thing), couldn’t ask for a better place to vacation quietly and privately! Can’t wait to come back!"
9282,159,A perfect little 1 bedroom with everyone we needed for beach weekend. The pool was the perfect respite in the afternoon. Lots of restaurant options close by.
9283,159,"Our first trip to Emerald Isle was great! This location is close to the beach, has a great view of Bogue Sound, a lovely little pool to hang out in, and plenty of space for a small family. We’d definitely stay here again!"
9284,159,Great sound side location. Loved swimming in the pool
9285,159,"Our stay at Bogue Banks was really perfect. Lovely apt with pool and dock right on the sound...walk to places to eat and drink...ice cream and fish market! QUIET Public beach with free shaded parking about a block away. Just minutes to Atlantic Beach, Ft Macon, and historic Beaufort! We look forward to a return trip!"
9286,159,This is our second stay. Both times have exceeded our expectations. We really enjoy the location and amenities.
9287,159,"A small but well-appointed apartment with a wonderful kid friendly pool, Bogue Banks Retreat felt like home for our Emerald Isle vacation. We cooked in the apartment for most meals since the kitchen was equipped with everything we needed. In addition to the pictured appliances there is a toaster, blender, and mini food processor.

Terrific location between two nearby public access beaches, one with parking close to the beach and the other with restrooms and outdoor showers. Just 15 minutes to shopping and food at either end of the island.

There is a small playground nearby but it is surrounded by private properties so not easily accessible - turn down Ballpark Rd past the Dollar General. The apartment has few wall switches, just look for pull chains and lamp switches. The air bed or pull out couch would be quite a tight fit; plan to rely on the king and queen beds. It was perfect for our family of 4!"
9288,159,We really enjoyed our stay! Great location near many local restaurants. The apartment has everything you need plus great views. We will definitely be staying here again!
9289,159,Very nice accommodations.
9290,159,We had a great stay at Angela’s! Such a pretty property.
9291,159,Lovely little spot! Great for a couple or small family. Unit was inviting and had everything we needed to make ourselves comfortable. Great views too!
9292,159,Great place. Great host! Will be back for sure
9293,159,"Very charming, beautifully decorated space with a gorgeous view!"
9294,159,"It was amazing! Beautiful view especially enjoyed sitting on the dock . The apartment was decorated in beach decor , very tastefully done -Loved it ! Very Clean , beds were very comfortable-slept great - we did not use the pool but it looked cool and Inviting also very clean. Location was perfect-walking distance to seafood restaurant, pizza and fresh seafood! Angela had great communication- Five star all the way around 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟"
9295,159,The pool was perfect and even had toys for my kids!
9296,159,Great communication. Easily accessible. Very clean with everything needed for the stay.
9297,159,"Fantastic location and views! perfect for a family or small group of friends! comfortable beds and chairs! pool cherry on top! easy check in, would definitely recommend and return"
9298,159,We had an amazing time staying here. It was clean and an amazing location. The pool is really nice and the pier lookout was beautiful. Would stay again!
9299,159,Home away from home.. a great place to stay!!
9300,159,Thank you for a nice stay
9301,159,This is a great place in a great location! Was perfect for our family of 3. Can’t beat the sound side sunsets and access to the bench on the dock was amazing!
9302,159,Outdated
9303,159,Cozy apartment in a great location. Access to pool and private dock is incredible.
9304,159,"I stayed here last year and really enjoyed it, to the point I made it an annual thing to come back with some friends when school gets out. Usually I’d say a place isn’t as good the second time around, but the cozy interior and the beautiful view of the water will probably never grow old to me. I cannot wait to stay here again next year!"
9305,159,Angela has been a very friendly and attentive host. Beds were very comfortable and the coffee was delicious. It is a very nice location too.
9306,159,"We had a great time at Angela's! Great view of the bayside, walking distance to great little restaurants, short drive to the beach and aquarium, and a perfect pool to cool off in! The apartment was perfect for our family of 4-clean, accommodating, and comfortable!"
9307,159,Terrific place in a terrific location. Super clean and Angela was a great hostess. Can’t wait to return.
9308,159,This was the highlight of my trip. Staying with Angela. Beautiful beautiful place. Clean and designed wonderfully. The pool. The outside setting. The dock to watch the sun come up or down. The bike ride. The warmth. And chips when I came in. Great for a hungry little traveller. Thank you so much for your attention to detail 💜
9309,159,"Beautiful house set next to the sound. Views are amazing, pool is clean and refreshing. Dock is great for sitting, fishing, or enjoying nature. Everything you need for your stay is provided, and more! Host makes sure you feel at home and are comfortable with all the special touches and great use of space. Cannot wait to go back and stay again!! ❤️ ❤️"
9310,159,The place was very clean and comfortable! it was peaceful and quiet!
9311,159,Very cute downstairs apartment in a quiet area with everything you need to be comfy. Two restaurants within walking distance. Dock to watch the sunset from and bird watch. Great stay!
9312,159,"Angela has, by far, the nicest house on the road. She is very quick to respond to Airbnb messages and is a very good communicator. Having a dedicated parking space for the listing is a nice touch. Driving in after dark was odd, especially given the surrounding buildings. This was compounded by the apartment being completely unlocked and unsecured. A little creepy, especially since I had my child with me (again, it was after dark). Angela had left an inside light on for us, as requested. By happy coincidence Angela drove in right as I was trying to decide what to do. She was very friendly (hope your cold is better!) and showed us around. House is beautiful and apartment is nicely decorated with beachy items. The apartment was clean and the bed was comfortable. The view of the water is pretty great, but I'm not sure I would go back, completely no offense to Angela. Arriving to an unsecured apartment, in an area where I didn't necessarily feel safe, set me on edge for the rest of the night. We were scheduled to leave early in the morning, so the area might look completely different in the light of day. By the way, the Crab Shack restaurant around the corner is staffed by perhaps the nicest people in any restaurant. Definitely pop in there if you stay at Angela's beautiful home."
9313,159,"This was the Perfect place to stay at, Angela is super sweet & helpful!"
9314,159,Great views of the sound. Cute place!
9315,159,"Wonderful stay with a wonderful host! Easy to get to the beach, aquarium, downtown Beaufort and Fort Macon. Our family made a lot of sweet memories!"
9316,159,Excellent
9317,159,"Great stay! Will be back! Pool was awesome! Close drive to beach access, food, souvenir shops etc."
9318,159,"Expect to be taken away by the small town fisherman feel… it’s amazing. No busy hustle bustle and just easy going kindness. It was an experience our family will always remember and hope to actually become “locals” as we loved it so much, we want to buy property down there! This is truly a hidden gem"
9319,159,Such a relaxing and beautiful stay! We will be back!
9320,159,This place was great and we wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy the beautiful views of the sound. Angela is a lovely.
9321,159,Expect a wonderful view and a wonderful place to stay!
9322,159,Exactly as described. Beautifully decorated and right on the sound. Will return!
9323,159,"We absolutely loved the place. It’s cozy and great for relaxation. We found everything we needed in the kitchen. Also, offering Netflix was a great plus.
Thank you Angela for sharing this lovely nest."
9324,159,"What a charming hideaway - quiet, and peaceful, with a fabulous sunrise view out back! Very comfortable beds, a well-resourced kitchen and coffee area, loads of seating options inside and out, and sweet decor. Very comfortable for 3 adult guests."

9326,159,Angela was such a great host. The views were amazing. We will definitely be back very soon.

9328,159,"What a great place, so very clean, quiet, beautiful setting with a pool and Angela is a great host - the place is right on the water and close to the beach and quick access to Morehead City, Beaufort, Atlantic Beach etc. Very good value!"
9329,159,The view was amazing. I couldn’t believe how close we were to the water on both sides! The apartment was really cute and had everything we needed. Angela is a great host and very easy to get in touch with. We will definitely be staying here again!
9330,159,Great view!
9331,159,"Great stay! Place was clean, very cute, great views, right on the water. Angela was wonderful and very attentive."
9332,159,Wonderful location. sweet modest place.
9333,159,Great stay! Perfect for our family of five. Clean and cute with a great location!
9334,159,The location on Bogue Banks was ideal for us. The place was clean and homey. I would recommend this place for others.
9335,159,"Angela is amazing! She asked we to call, I did, she let me know that the air conditioner in the bedroom wasn’t cooling. She asked me to let her know if it wasn’t when we arrived. We found it was not cooling, I called to let her know and she said she would replace it the next day. We left to get breakfast and we arrived back about 11 and there was a new unit that was cooling beautifully! The apartment is cute, clean and has every kitchen need! The location is fantastic! We ate most breakfasts by the pool overlooking the sound! Quiet neighborhood but centrally located, it was the perfect getaway! Can’t say enough!!!"
9336,159,"100% recommendation. Peaceful, fully equipped, clean, on the water, close to the beach and good restaurants."
9337,159,We have stayed here multiple times and absolutely love it. Having the pool is amazing after a day at the beach . Great location and everything u need.

9341,159,Loved watching seagulls while drinking coffee - comfy beds and cute apt ! Indian beach was minutes away - we had fun in the pool - very clean
9342,159,"Shhhhh, don’t tell anyone that this is really truly the best gem on the entire island. At the end of a road, right on the sound, private dock to bring in the sunrise and sunset, pool to watch the sound….sound too good to be true? Um, add on that you can walk to a the Crab Shack AND Anchor Pizza (fabulous pizza and great craft beers) AND Willis Seafood…which you can cook in the full kitchen back at Angela’s place. Honestly, this place has it all. We are coming back….shhhh, keep the secret!"
9343,159,Great location is a quiet neighborhood. The house is right on the Sound. It has it's own pier and a swimming pool. It is with walking distance of a seafood and pizza restaurant.
9344,159,"This apartment was super clean, comfy and cozy!! Felt like home!! Had everything you could possibly need inside!"
9345,159,"We felt so welcomed! It was easy to check in, and there were lots of thoughtful details that made our stay feel personable."

9353,161,"Beautiful, cozy, quiet cottage. Rebekah answered all of our questions and made check in/out easy. The cottage was neat and clean and had all that we needed. It’s a nice retreat after a day downtown or at the beach. We were surprised by the well water that smelled heavily of sulfur. Also, the neighborhood was quite a mixture of abandoned houses, campers, and nice houses."

9383,161,"This place was great! just private enough and far enough from Beaufort and i still be able to see the city. My wife and I enjoy our stay very much.

9391,161,Great place to stay for a beach weekend. Very cozy and has everything you need to get through!
9392,161,"Bekah’s Bungalow is a beautiful get away! It’s far enough away to enjoy the peace and quiet of Down East, but close enough to get to places of interest in Harkers Island, Beaufort and Morehead City. The house is beautifully decorated and very comfortable. The owner is helpful and quick to respond to questions. I spend a lot of time in this area of NC and wouldn’t hesitate to book again."
9393,161,Cute cottage was perfect for our weekend stay. Very quiet location. We enjoyed the porch every morning.

There are lots of beautiful beaches and outdoor activities within a 15-30 minute drive. Downtown Beaufort is only about 15 minutes away and is a nice city to walk around in, with lots of local shops."
9418,161,"Rebekah’s place was perfect for our getaway! It is very clean and welcoming, and is located close to both downtown Beaufort and Harkers Island. I hope we can go back soon!"

9420,161,"Beautiful, cozy and clean home."
9421,161,"If I could give her 20 stars I would! Rebekah was so sweet and accommodating, we had a few issues with a lock (mostly our fault) but she was so quick to respond and fix it. Her place was so pretty and so perfectly decorated, you could tell they didn’t cheap out on anything. We felt so at home. I love it there I wish I could take this place with me! Definitely stay here if you’re thinking about it."
9422,161,"This was the CUTEST place ever! So comfortable and aesthetically pleasing! Close to everything, but quiet enough to get some alone time with your family. Rebekah was so kind and communicated so well! We enjoyed it very much!"
9423,161,"Rebekah’s bungalow is a very beautiful, cozy place to stay. The host is very willing to answer questions to help make ones stay more comfortable.

I Very much highly recommend staying there!"
9424,162,"This place is awesome. Clean, quiet. Just perfect. I came for a week and worked remote. Highly recommend this place!"
9425,162,"We stayed here for a second year in a row and had another wonderful stay. Great place to get offline and recharge. Perfect for cooking, reading on the porch, writing and, of course, going to the beach. Jon and Amberly have really thought of just about every detail to make your visit really comfortable. Excellent hosts and a wonderful, special
little place."
9426,162,"Makana is a magical retreat on Hatteras Island. The house is close to access to both the sound and the beach, yet tucked away in the trees. Jon and Amberly stock the house with everything you could possibly need from kitchen equipment to bug spray to throw blankets and puzzles. Morning coffee on the covered porch is the best. If you’re interested in staying in a unique property set up for disconnecting and relaxing with awesome owners who are available for whatever you need but also give you complete privacy - book your stay at Makana! Makana is also a perfect retreat if you need to do some remote work during your stay. The house has flawless, fast internet (in our case fast enough for two people to video call at once) and an office nook with a full sized desk."
9427,162,Loved our stay at Makana! It’s literally the perfect get away. The house was extremely clean and well prepared for guests.
9428,162,The cottage was very clean and welcoming! Everything we needed for a relaxing beach trip was provided. The house book had a lot of helpful info on the area. The space was beautiful inside and out!
9429,162,"We were looking for a relaxing getaway and got it and more in this gem of a home. Nestled back off the street, most cozy outdoor porch and perfection for lazing about and enjoying a chance to disconnect. Everything is perfectly laid out and thoughtful. Nothing to want for, even enjoyed the variety of great reads and games. The kitchen is well stocked and the items for the beach are perfect, we finally perfected the sun shade provided. The hosts are super helpful and communicative and I love the area, away from the tourist parts of the OBX but still have access to everything you could need and of course great access to the sound and coast!"
9430,162,"Makana was such an awesome experience! The cottage is within view of the sound and it’s the perfect place to unwind. It was very clean and had everything that we could think of that might be a necessary during the stay. The cottage is very unique and definitely gives you that beach feel! We also loved the walkway which is lit up at night and is lined with buoys which is a nice touch. The grounds are beautifully landscaped and it was overall a wonderful week. We would definitely love to come back in the future! Also, the hosts are very accommodating and provide clear communication!
Great find."
9431,162,"Really helpful, answered all of our questions. Clean cottage, really cool with nice woodwork. Yard was well manicured and the porch was really nice. Kitchen has everything you will need, bathrooms had everthing you will need. Even laundry detergent was provided. There was even beach gear and towels. I would highly recommend this Air BnB to anyone. It was the best Air BnB We have ever stayed at. Much better than any hotel."
9432,162,I wish I could give a 6 star in some of these categories. The house was impeccable and all of the essentials are in place. We thoroughly enjoyed the house and our beach vacation. I look forward to future visits.
9433,162,Just a great place to visit without the large crowds.
9434,162,Excellent hosts and a wonderful little beach cottage!
9435,162,"Great płace and location ,beautiful cottage ,you will have all you need. Walking distance to the beach but not life guard on duty, short ride to family beach , great stay overall, though small 2 bedrooms ."
9436,162,"The cottage was spotless upon arrival- we are picky with cleanliness and it was hands down the cleanest Airbnb we’ve stayed at. The place is very well kept, with nice everything- kitchen items, linens, towels, etc (no cheap stuff). We enjoyed meals on the quiet patio and listening to nature outside. Definitely recommend for a couple or small family."
9437,162,"This was our second stay at Makana and once again we absolutely loved it!! This house is a perfect get away when you just need to relax and unwind. Jon and Amberly are amazing hosts. They always know the answers to our questions, can provide a suggestion at the drop of a hat and have prepared the house for anything and everything you might need. We love it at Makana and hope we can make it an annual visit!"
9438,162,We are so glad to have repeat guests and happy to be part of your adventures on Hatteras Island. Thanks for being such great guests and we look forward to your return!
9439,162,"Makana is simply perfect! This cottage has everything you need to relax and enjoy. Our Island Life vacation included kayaking on the sound, bike riding, stargazing (you can see the Milky Way from the boardwalk at lot #27), afternoons at the beach, and crabbing. A & J are wonderful hosts & quick to respond to any question. We can’t wait to go back!"
9440,162,"This is an absolute getaway. Nature meets comfort, privacy meets charm; the Makana cottage is it's own little island with everything you need in house, while also being well appointed for adventuring and situated among a community of helpful and warm people. I absolutely reccomend this stay as a peaceful, comfy and clean home base as you explore beautiful Hatteras Island. My husband and I celebrated our ten year aniversary here and we couldn't be more pleased with our experience."
9441,162,Had a wonderful stay at Makana! Perfect location and the house is adorable. Thank you A&J for your hospitality!
9442,162,"This was the perfect location for our relaxing getaway! The house is spotless with all the amenities you could need. Great location between the beach and sound, and the hosts were very considerate and attentive. Would highly recommend, and would definitely go back!"
9443,162,"Makana was such a treat! 5 stars all the way! Excellent location, beautiful cottage, good vibes only, well stocked everything, extremely clean, awesome porch, perfect outdoor shower, fantastic hosts, and pure OBX beauty. It was just an all around perfect get away for my wife and I. Quick walk to the beach, moments to a sunset sound side, and just around the corner from the Blue Whale which if they don't have it you don't need it.
Great communication from Hosts and Perfect OBX Cottage. We will be back!"
9444,162,"This place is delightful. Well stocked with all the necessities and more, wonderful hosts, and perfect location. Can’t wait to come back! Thanks, Jon & Amberly!"
9445,162,"Do not sleep on this opportunity! The pictures, reviews, and descriptions of Makana are accurate but until you're there, sitting on the deck listening to all that the surroundings have to offer, taking in the scent of the jasmine (or was it honeysuckle?) in the yard, you won't really know all that Makana has to offer. It was an incredible stay. The house is miraculous - we have never stayed at an AirBNB that was so well appointed. Everything was thought of including lush towels, everything you'd need in a kitchen, high quality appliances, equipment and comfortable furniture. We hope to come back again and again."
9446,162,"We just returned from our second stay at Makana, and it was just as fabulous as we remembered! The only thing we did not like was having to come home! This is a perfect place to relax and unwind, which we needed greatly! The hosts are fabulous, as well! We hope to return sooner the next time!"
9447,162,"Makana contained exactly everything needed for us to feel at home. The light-filled kitchen had everything we needed, and we found small tasteful details everywhere. This was my best AirBnB experience so far and I'm already planning our return."
9448,162,Fabulous place - we absolutely love it
9449,162,"My second stay at Makana was amazing, this house is so cozy. Amberley and Jon supply everything you could possibly need. From the quality custom woodwork, to the huge comfy porch, to the butterfly-attracting gardens, this little gem is perfect. The kitchen has anything you might need to prepare your own meals. The bedding and towels are super nice, also. Bathroom is very nicely tiled, this place has ha a lot of nice touches put into it. The beach art is very tasteful and completely appropriate for Makana. I can't wait to stay again!"
9450,162,This house is so great. A short walk to the ocean and cute little locally owned shops and restaurants. Highly recommend.
9451,162,"Makana is a gem! We had a ridonkulously great stay there. Amongst a sea of OBX Airbnb‘s, Makana stands out with its unique design and layout, the craftsmanship of the home and the thoughtful furnishings. This is not your standard beach rental. The hosts have thought of every need you could possibly have. It’s one of the best equipped places you’ll stay in (especially the kitchen). We had a blast!"
9452,162,"We had a wonderful time at this lovely beach house! Close to both sound and beach. Enjoyed paddle boarding at sunset and sitting on the porch with awesome views and breezes. Love the beautiful woodwork in the home, gardens and awesome buoy tree in the front yard. Such a special place. Would love to go back. Great hosts!"
9453,162,"Probably the best Airbnb we stayed at in the United States. Perfect location away from the crowds, but central enough that you could get anywhere on the Outer Banks within 30 to 60 minutes, depending on traffic. Wonderful beach and there was nothing lacking in the house, which was in excellent condition and cute as could be. Amazing choice. Would go back in a heartbeat"
9454,162,"Thank you for the very kind words! We work very hard to make Makana a special place. We’re very glad we could share it with you. All the best, A & J."
9455,162,Amazing hosts for an amazing place. Perfect little getaway in OBX. would definitely stay at this magical retreat again and recommend to friends.
9456,162,"Makana is amazing. The energy and beauty in the home are beyond words. Not a detail was spared inside and out. A&J are exceptional hosts. They graciously answered all our questions, and always responded very quickly. We know this is a rare find. We will definitely come back!"
9457,162,"OBX Makana was one of the best BnB experiences we’ve ever had!! Amberly & Jon have thought of everything! This place is equipped with all you’d ever need for your stay and more. The location is amazing, secluded with lots of privacy, and just a short walk to the beach. The place was spotlessly clean and their attention to detail is above and beyond. We’ll definitely be back for another stay!!

- Brandon & Maya"
9458,162,"My wife and I just returned from celebrating our 10th anniversary in the OBX and the Makana Cottage was certainly one of the highlights! Perfect location, just minutes from the beach, clean, quiet, and with wonderful hosts. Thank you, Jon and Amberley, for helping make our celebration perfect!"
9459,162,"Wow. Makana is amazing. The location is great, the cottage is spotless and well equipped, check-in and out is easy and you couldn't ask for better hosts than A&J. The beds are comfortable which is always a big deal.
I have to mention the outdoor shower. It is covered with flowers...morning glories bloom in the morning and Passion flowers in the afternoon. The back porch is quiet and the perfect place to rest and read.
Anyway, we can't wait to go back."
9460,162,Makana was a beautiful house in an excellent location! The beach cart was a really awesome touch to help us transport our chairs and things to the (very not-crowded) beach.
9461,162,"Makana is an incredible oasis on Hatteras. Beautifully and thoughtfully furnished, the house and lovely yard give off a happy, relaxing vibe. It’s a very hard place to leave.

Jon and Amberly have thought of everything and are the consummate hosts. Their attention to detail and obvious love they have for Makana and Hatteras is very evident.

The porch is beyond. The beach? Stunning. And the sunsets were amazing. Definitely my best trip to the OBX ever. Kudos to Jon and Amberly!"
9462,162,"Everything about the home is comfortable and designed with relaxation in mind. The walk to the beach is relatively short and the owners graciously provide you with a cart to make it as easy as possible to transport your gear! There are some great options for food around the area - Waves Market just down the street has an amazing selection of not only groceries but made to order food as well. Hatteras Bowls was amazing. Muffins and Scones south of the home before Buxton has amazing bagels. All in all, we greatly enjoyed our stay and would gladly recommend Makana to anyone wanting a relaxing stay in the OBX."
9463,162,"This house is so charming, and has a large outdoor porch with a roof overhead where you can take naps or read books or listen to music or play multiple games of Rummy. We were serenaded by a variety of birds and one night we could hear the owl. Another night we forgot to latch the compost can and believe a raccoon took off with the shells of the grapefruit. Our take away from that experience: latch the compost can! The kitchen is well stocked and there's a tiny office with a desk at the corner of the house where I did some work. Our teenagers slept in the mornings, attended their online classes and spent their late afternoons on the beach. The open loft was a darling place for them to retreat to at night. My mother, 81, fell in love with the house -- and with the undeveloped and protected areas of the island -- that she is already thinking of dates when to return again someday."
9464,162,Makana is a beautiful place and was much better than expected. Very quite and relaxing home. We definitely recommend.
9465,162,"Great property for 2-3 people. Outdoor shower was great and the porch, any time of day was great to relax and watch the birds. Great location and wonderful hosts."
9466,162,"This place is absolute perfection! Not only is it beautiful, but it had everything we needed to have the relaxing vacation we wanted. Everything from the comfy back porch, to the fully stocked kitchen, to the OUTDOOR SHOWER. We can't stop talking about how much we loved Makana. It's in a perfect location, with sound on one side and beach on the other. It is also close to a lot of great shops and restaurants. Amberly was very easy to communicate with and was able to offer suggestions for all my questions. She even let us know we had left behind a t-shirt and allowed us to come back to pick it up! If you are traveling to the Outer Banks, Makana is a definite must stay!"
9467,162,"We loved this peaceful, cozy cottage and all the thoughtful touches. We especially appreciated the privacy and quick access to the beach and surrounding shops. Jon and Amberly were very helpful and really thought of everything to make our stay comfortable. Makana is truly a gift."
9468,162,"This place is the loveliest of places to retreat. We absolutely loved celebrating our anniversary here. The hosts are highly responsive and hospitable -- you'll find yourself saying, ""Wow, these folks have thought of everything we could've needed!"" Come here if you want a private, beautiful, spacious, magical time. The comfy mattress and the outdoor shower are like the icing on the most wonderful of cakes. If this space is available, book it! You won't regret it, friends."
9469,162,"I stayed with a friend visiting from out of state and we loved the cottage and the island. We had a great time relaxing on the beach on the ocean side and kayaking on the sound side. I couldn't believe how close we were to both. The cottage is really beautifully redone with lots of thoughtful touches. We enjoyed the big porch with the ocean breeze and spent a lot of time out there going through the binder with all the local brochures and menus. The hosts have great tips on things to do. Overall just a wonderful long, relaxing, fun weekend! Would love to go back."
9470,162,"This place was gorgeous and super convenient to a relatively under-populated stretch of beach. The outdoor shower was a real pleasure after a sunny, sandy day of beach."
9471,162,"Such an amazing house. Super charming, clean and the owners had everything you needed. Right next to the sound allowed for amazing sunset and only minutes from the beach. We definitely hope to visit and stay at Makana again soon."
9472,162,"From the comfortable sectional on the covered porch, you can see the water of the sound or put in your kayak at the end of a little dirt path a two minute walk from that same porch. In seven minutes, you can stroll along a pretty tree and flower lined street to a gorgeous public access path through dunes and more trees and flowers to the beach itself. 15 minutes south are good seafood restaurants and 10 minutes north are good shops. For a day trip, you’re an easy 30 minute drive along a scenic and historic road to everything that Manteo and Nagshead offer. But it’s the house, Makana, that you’ll fall in love with. If you have an eye for history, architecture, art, and vintage collectibles as well as light and air, you’ll love just being at home there. In addition to the charm, however, you’ll find super modern comfort oriented conveniences like plenty of hot water, a soaker tub, gas cooking stove, and my personal favorite no TV It’s definitely a part of the OBX made for low key, homebody types (there aren’t many arcades, jet skis or outlet malls nearby) but my 10 and 11-year-old boys fished, camped, skateboarded, swam, biked, hiked, and dug for seven days while I enjoyed some peace and quiet because everything is so tranquil that the kids were able to have lots of independence."
9473,162,"Makana was a fabulous place for a great escape. We are birders, outdoor lovers and were desperate for an escape from a terrible 2020! And this place did not disappoint. The house was fabulous. It was not the mega mansion on the beach but instead was a friendly oasis tucked in the trees with a view of the sound from the comfortable porch. It felt so private...like we had our own retreat amidst everything.

The interior has beautiful touches including a staircase to the upstairs bedroom that doubled as a piece of art, a reading nook, and a wonderful deep bathtub. The outside included a porch perfectly appointed making evening birdwatching so enjoyable. (We actually added five new birds just from the couch on the porch!) The kitchen was also wonderfully appointed...there are several things I now must have for my kitchen. Given COVID and cooking all our meals at the house, the kitchen was a delight and so appreciated.

But what made the place so wonderful were the hosts. We needed a paddle (one showed up on the porch), we had an incident and needed a mechanic (and recommendations came immediately after my email), and finding seafood during COVID when everything was closed was immediately answered with a great local place that was indeed open. Having rented lots of Airbnb’s, having someone who is accessible and isn’t running a million places as a business, and really cares makes ALL the difference. Our hosts were wonderful and we will be back! If you love the outdoors, want a relaxing trip to disconnect from the world and reconnect with your family, this is the place! Thanks Makana’s place!"
9474,162,Jon and Amberly were absolutely incredible. Super fast responses and the property is beautiful. We had such a great time. I wish we could stay longer.
9475,162,"Makana was the perfect place for our honeymoon. At first we were sad that COVID cancelled our trip to Ireland, but we are so happy it did! The peace and beauty of the Outer Banks is unparalleled and Makana echoes that atmosphere. The house is not only immaculate and comfortable, but beautiful! From stained glass elements to gorgeous woodworking, this is an artistic space. Mornings the birds flock around the porch, providing a sweet accompaniment to the sound of the lapping waters of the bay. The walk to the beach is pleasant and once there, the beach itself is clean, stunning and largely empty so privacy is always present. Local vendors for seafood as well as restaurants and shops are 15-20 min drives away. So are historical locations and national parks. But if you want to stay in, the home is welcoming on a gray day or for a relaxing evening. Don't skip the loft, waking in the sun from the skylight is incredible. A truly wonderful experience!"
9476,162,"The cottage is simply spectacular and the hosts are amazing. When we got to the house and opened the front door we where shocked to find such a jewel and beautiful place. The woodwork around the interior is incredible to say the least. Small details like retro working condition radios made the stay more special. We BBQ one night, it was super. The hosts where available to answer any questions we had within minutes on the app. When you walk in, you feel like home. So much to look at in the house and super clean. The loft is one of my favorite areas of the house, very private and still cozy and comfy. Sofa was comfortable too. Kitchen has everything we needed plus more. We will be back 100% sure, such a beautiful place!!! Thank you very much!!! Sad to leave.... Oh, this place is close to great local spots for Kiteboarding, Surfing Shops, Restaurants, etc."
9477,162,"The Makana Cottage is completely magical and idyllic. We came for our honeymoon after COVID-19 changed many of our plans and it could not have been a more perfect escape. The house is super cozy with all kinds of thoughtful and personal touches, the kitchen has pretty much any appliance or tool you might need, and the yard and porch is so peaceful with all kinds of flowers and greenery. Jon & Amberly were super gracious hosts and kept in communication with us when we weren’t sure we were going to be able to get through on our first day because N.C.-12 was flooded. Luckily, we were able to get through and had the most lovely and peaceful stay. Thanks times a million! Can’t wait to come back in the future."
9478,162,"This place is magical! We spent a week at Makana in lieu of our honeymoon trip to Bali that was cancelled due to COVID. We couldn’t have picked a more relaxing and wonderful space. The house is gorgeous, clean, the beds are cozy, you can see the sound from the deck and the beach is a 5 minute walk the other way. The kitchen is stocked with everything - even a crock pot! We brought our kayaks and took advantage of the kayak access at the end of the road. Cannot recommend it enough and we will be back!!"
9479,162,An absolutely beautiful cottage and great location! The outdoor living space was definitely our favorite! Will definitely come back!
9480,162,"Such a lovely escape! The beaches in Salvo (and surrounding area) have absolutely beautiful with wide sandy beaches and lovely cold water. The house is absolutely adorable with lots of thoughtful touches - the kitchen is lovely to cook in, the porch (with the right big repellent) is great to read or enjoy a cup of tea or a glass of wine, and the outdoor shower is a work of art (with butterflies and flowers surrounding you). Such an amazing house in a terrific place."
9481,162,"This was our second stay at this airbnb — and it is still my FAVORITE place I’ve ever stayed. It’s a beautiful home, we love how close it is to the Sound, and yet still easy access to the ocean. Salvo is quaint and quiet, and Jon & Amberly are outstanding hosts. I don’t want to say too much though, because it might get all booked up for next year when we hope to return! :)"
9482,162,"It was an amazing first time experience to the outter banks! My fiancé and myself were very happy with how spotless the cottage was, and all the amenities! It was simply amazing!"
9483,162,"We spent two weeks here in July with our young kids and had simply an amazing time. Very clean with special little touches everywhere! Well-equipped kitchen, amazing outdoor shower, and truly wonderful hosts who were ultra responsive and helpful in every way. Also, in times of COVID, we felt extra safe knowing all of the extra little steps that were done to make sure everything was safe and clean. We’d highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a relaxing beach getaway!"
9484,162,"This place is perfect for a beach trip - close access to the beach, an amazing outdoor shower, and a house with all kinds of thoughtful touches."
9485,162,"We really enjoyed our visit to Makana for our honeymoon. The space was very stylish and clean, and the location was great. Jon and Amberly were excellent hosts and were quick to respond to questions and offer tips for the local setting. We definitely recommend this spot for anyone looking to stay in the area."
9486,162,"Spotlessly clean, thoughtfully decorated, and filled with unexpected and delightful amenities - a must when visiting the Cape!"
9487,162,Makana is the perfect getaway on Hatteras Island. The cottage is beautiful and unique with so many personal touches by Amberly and Jon that make the house so special. They go above and beyond with providing recommendations and suggestions on things to do in the area. We also loved the older radio/stereo system to listen to some tunes while cooking in the beautiful kitchen. We loved the open concept of the house with the gas fire place and natural light. Location is great too just being minutes from the sound and a short walk to the beach. We will definitely be coming back!
9488,162,Absolutely amazing location and value. It was the perfect weekend getaway and the cottage is extremely stylish. My only regret is that I didn't have longer to stay.
9489,162,"Amberly was incredibly helpful when mother nature decided to wash over Highway 12, shutting down the route and preventing us from getting to the cottage. As you can imagine the sudden change of plans could have destroyed a weekend away. Instead, Amberly‘s quick and helpful communication enabled us to find a place at the last minute further up the coast. We look forward to staying at their lovely cottage in the near future."
9490,162,"Makana is a lovely space in a great location.
It was so peaceful and quiet. It was exactly what we needed."
9491,162,"Perfect location on Hatteras Island. Beautiful little place on the sound side, a 10 walk to the beach. Makana is a true craftsman’s beach cottage. Has everything you need and then some. The owners have thought of everything. 5 Stars all around. We will be back."
9492,162,"If we could only use one word to describe Makana and the hosts, it would be ""perfect."" The house is the sweetest beach cottage...literally out of a story book. From the craft wood details throughout the home, vintage radio, stained glass windows, and cozy porch with hammock and wind chimes, we would recommend Makana to anyone planning to visit the area. The hosts had great communication with us prior to arrival and throughout our stay, were impressively quick responding to our messages, and were beyond helpful in giving us local tips, directions, and recommendations. The house was fully stocked with the necessities, and perfectly clean. The location is great too. Picture perfect beaches and awesome surf spots just a stone's throw away, and a great mid-way point between Nag's Head and the southern towns. We would absolutely stay there again, we could not have chosen a better place for our little beach getaway. Thanks Amberly and Jon!!"
9493,162,We had an amazing time at this wonderful place. The hospitality was great and the cottage full of lovely details. We enjoyed the stay and would come back any time
9494,162,A truly wonderful experience and the perfect place to spend our first vacation as a family of three. We especially loved the outdoor shower and spending time on the porch. Love love love!
9495,162,"Brilliant location, loved the house and recommendations"
9496,163,"Luis and Kelly -are by far the most amazing and attentive host we have ever had. We book VRBO and Air BNB all the time. The owners made us feel like we were VIP.

From the moment we pulled up we were impressed with all the curb appeal this little cabin had to offer. We loved the cozy Cabin and all the details that were put into creating a fantastic stay. You can see and feel the pride in Ownership.

The back yard is a magical private oasis with the hanging lights around the deck, hot tub, fire pit and additional seating.

There are a lot of hiking areas nearby and after a full days hike - this is the perfect and most relaxing retreat . We highly recommend the Cozy Cabin!"
9497,163,"My husband and I stayed at the cabin for a couple of nights to celebrate our anniversary. Loved the cozy comfort of Luis and Kelly’s place! We enjoyed relaxing in the hot tub and roasting marshmallows over the fire. I’m a professional chef and we brought our own food to make. The kitchen was great to work in, and it was nice to use the outside gas grill as well! Overall this place made for a great mini getaway and we look forward to coming back!!"
9498,163,Thank you so much Angelina! We hope we made your special getaway a memorable one. Without a doubt would love to have you back. Thank you again!! Kelly and Luis
9499,163,"My family and I had the pleasure of staying at Cozy Peak. What a special, cozy, and romantic place. The Cozy Peak had so many interesting spaces to enjoy and unwind. Our hosts were fantastic and very responsive to all our needs. We truly enjoyed our stay and did not want t lo leave. Definitely looking forward to our return in the near future. If your looking for a unique stay I recommend the Cozy Peak."
9500,163,Estevan it was a pleasure having you and Ashley stay with us! We are extremely honored you chose our cabin from such a far distance. We can't wait for your return!
9501,163,The house was beautiful. It was cozy and and the location was so peaceful. This is the perfect place for a relaxing weekend. Kelly and Luis were very responsive. We would absolutely stay here again.

9503,163,"Luis & Kelly we’re wonderful hosts! Easy to get ahold of, friendly and made our stay easy to understand with their itinerary. The cozy peak cabin is exactly just that! Cozy and comfortable. We would highly recommend!"
9504,163,"Kasandra! Thank you for choosing the Cozy Peak. We're so happy you guys were able to enjoy your stay! Glad our cabin was what you needed, Luis & Kelly"
9505,163,"Run don’t walk to book this cozy paradise! We had such an amazing time and this cabin had everything and more! The kitchen has everything you need to make a meal, the spaces are so much fun!! The jacuzzi, swing room, back patio are all such fun spaces to take in the beautiful surroundings with your favorite beverage! Luis and Kelly were so quick to respond! We enjoyed our quiet rainy Sunday, playing games, watching movies and getting toasty by the fire!! Nothing and I mean nothing has not been thoughtful appointed in this cute cabin!!"
9506,163,Thank Julianne! I was a pleasure to host your family for your getaway! Please come again!
9507,163,What a great couple days to relax and spend time together with my family. The cabin was amazing! It had everything we needed and more. There is a grocery store 15 away that made it super convenient to get groceries and stuff for s’mores 😋. Luis and Kelly have really done such a great job making this spot a great place to enjoy the mountains and Lake Lure. Felt like home. Thank you guys so much!
9508,163,"Tiffany, it was our pleasure! We definitely would love to host your family again. Kelly and I worked very hard to make the Cozy Peak a welcoming home!"
9509,163,"We had an amazing weekend at the cozy cabin and can't wait to return. We loved the cozy and unique feel of the cabin, and it was stocked with everything we needed. We made breakfast both mornings, and the kitchen was perfect for cooking. We enjoyed sitting in front of the fireplace and soaking in the hot tub. Luis and Kelly were very responsive to any questions we had and were very flexible and accommodating. I would love to return in the Spring and Fall even though we had perfect weather in February. We didn't have our kids with us, but the loft looked like it would be such fun!"
9510,163,"Cindy it was a pleasure for Kelly and I to make sure you guys enjoyed your stay. We would definitely love to see your return. Your kids would definitely love the Fox Den. See you soon!

Kelly and Luis"
9511,163,"Our stay at Cozy Peak cabin was amazing to say the least! The view outside was beautiful, and there were so many options of things to do. It was very family friendly as well. The cabin was very clean and many small details were thought of.
Our hosts Luis and Kelly went above and beyond to make sure everything was perfect for our family!"
9512,163,Cozy Peak Cabin is so cute and quaint. I will say looks can be deceiving. Luis and Kelly used every inch of this cabin wisely and created a perfect charming space. On top of that they are amazing host. Thank you for allowing us to enjoy this beautiful gem for a few days. Can’t wait to enjoy this again in the summer 🤍
9513,163,"my experience at cozy peak cabin was incredible. this was my first 10/10 airbnb experience. the host were immaculate with communication, checking in daily, recommendations nearby,etc. Overall the host was very thoughtful and gracious. Everything was as perfect as it seemed online.
They provided us with all the information we needed. The airbnb was sooo cozy and i loved the amenities. My favorite area was the hammock and the fox den. Definitely one of my favorite stays and I will be visiting again."
9514,163,Aubrey was such an amazing guest! So polite. Aubrey and her family will definitely be welcomed to stay at the cozy peak again. Aubrey Come Back!
9515,163,"The Cozy Peak is such an appropriate name. What a spectacular Cozy little place! From the exterior, to the little details Luis and Kelly thought of for guests to enjoy were well thought out.

We normally rent near Blowing Rock for our Christmas Tree hunt in Boone, but took a different route to enjoy the drive up the Blueridge Parkway for change.

The kids enjoyed it as it has ""Ziggy"" (Alexa) where they were able to play holiday music on demand setting the mood for hot chocolate! Did I mention PS4 and XBox with a variety of games and mulitple controllers? We didnt play much, but it was nice to enjoy some gaming.

Since we are originally from Miami, we did not do the hottub even though it's hot. But I'm sure we can do that this coming summer! 😉

Luis and Kelly, thanks again for being such great hosts and making this trip memorable for our family!

Thanks for our Cozy Peak Mug!

-Tony"
9516,163,"Antonio, it was a pleasure hosting your family. We'd love to host you again, If you plan on coming up for the summer season. Hopefully by then, the Hot Tub will be operating. Our goal was to create a Zen like feel, and from your experience it seems we accomplish that.

Thank you again, Luis & Kelly"
9517,163,The Cozy Peak Cabin is beautifully decorated and has breathtaking views! Luis and Kelly are very caring hosts and the amenities are excellent. Our family thoroughly enjoyed staying at the Cozy Peak Cabin and would highly recommend it to all future guests!
9518,163,Kenneth thank you so much for the awesome review!!! Remember next time you come back to Lake Lure....contact me
9519,165,I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. The location is peaceful and far enough away from the city to be enjoyable while still being only 10-15 drive into town if you want to go do something.
9520,165,Super nice people.
9521,165,My home away from home. Love it! Clean and peaceful. The perfect horsey stay.
9522,165,"wonderful experience, great stay!"
9523,165,always pleasant
9524,165,Absolutely love this place and the owners. We will 100% be back for many more visits. Clean and exactly as described.
9525,165,"This is a great apartment for a long-term stay. The rooms are spacious, the furniture is very comfortable, the bedroom has ample dressers so no need to live out of a suitcase, plus the walk-in closet has plenty of room. We appreciated the washer/dryer especially. It is very, very quiet. You would never know there was a stable of horses below."
9526,165,"Great, quiet place. Great location, would stay again."
9527,165,"Amazing stay. Wonderful location and value. Lots of room. Nothing was needed. It’s well stocked
Highly recommend"
9528,165,"We loved our stay at the horse farm. Our grand daughter enjoyed seeing the horses every morning right outside our window. Amy went above and beyond, not only making our stay a pleasant one, but also made suggestions of things to do in the area with the little one. We would definitely stay again, if ever in the area."
9529,165,"Amy was a wonderful host and the apartment was so comfortable, well stocked and a lovely location. I recommend this as a place to stay if you are near Fayetteville, Southern Pines, Pinehurst or Vass. Lovely!"
9530,165,Lovely place to stay especially if you love horses. Amy was the perfect host and the apartment was lovely. Would highly recommend it.
9531,165,"This has to be the best deal on AirBNB. It's like a large one bedroom apartment. Living room, TV room, kitchen, large bedroom, and a great bathroom. Don't pass this one up."
9532,165,"Repeat stay in this lovely apartment, and, again, Amy did not disappoint."
9533,165,"This was a beautiful property. Lush grounds, beautiful horses and a comfortable apartment I could live in forever."
9534,165,"Amy’s place is perfect. It’s located in a beautiful setting, well-equipped, and it’s quite spacious. Amy and her family are very kind and welcoming. I enjoyed my stay!"
9535,165,"Loved my week here!
Easily the biggest one-bedroom place I've found in the Pinehurst area. Full kitchen, W/D, comfy bed, and ample relaxing space.
Nothing like waking early and petting a horse! Just a beautiful, tranquil farm.
Amy and her family are great.
Wholeheartedly recommend.
Thank you Dragsta Stables!!

P.S. Bring a tennis ball (or three) for Keeper and you have a sweet friend during your stay.
P.S.S. Valenti's Italian is a must for pizza or a calzone."
9536,165,"Having never visited this part of North Carolina, we were incredibly excited to find a unique Airbnb like this one. Imagine waking up and seeing horses from your window! The apartment above the barn is cozy and perfectly situated for taking in the view. We both grew up in rural areas, so my wife and I felt right at home on this beautiful farm. This was the perfect retreat for us!"
9537,165,"Don’t hesitate! Book this spot! This is the perfect place for any length of stay…we were here a week, but it has everything you’d need for a month. Full kitchen, lots of space and washer/dryer. Spotless and comfortable. Less than 20 minutes to Pinehurst, then home to this quiet spot where you wake up with horses outside your window. Hosts go above and beyond to be helpful. The friendly lab is named Keeper…but that would actually be a good name for this place, a definite keeper!"
9538,165,Beautiful location with a very clean and comfortable space that had everything we needed! We will definitely return!!
9539,165,Would highly recommend. Nice setting. Good accommodations. Amy was friendly and welcoming.
9540,165,Great place to stay!
9541,165,Exactly as described. So peaceful with beautiful views.
9542,165,Beautiful and relaxing to stay
9543,165,"The place is well furnished/equipped, clean, relaxing, and very quaint. If you’re looking for a nice place to escape to and yet still be close to the action of civilization and shops, this is the place to go. Good for couples or singles just passing through, as well! My fiancé and I only stayed one night to be in town for personal business, so we didn’t get to enjoy all that this place could offer. Regardless, there was plenty enough for one cozy night in. I can hardly put into words how lovely the area is but coming from one ‘countryside’ girl…it’s a pretty picture!"
9544,165,"Great location in the country, clean space, all the comforts of home! Will book this one again if i am able."
9545,165,It was such a delight staying at Amys. Peaceful quiet and the horses were beautiful to watch. The apartment was clean. The check in/out process was simple.
9546,165,"Amy was a great host. The unit was super spacious, very clean, well stocked and a beautiful setting in horse country! Will stay there again."
9547,165,"Beautiful farm and very comfortable apartment. I had to travel inward, but I would have happily stayed a few days to explore the area and the pottery corridor from this lovely horse farm."
9548,165,"Great place to get away from the city life and completely relax in the country at a beautiful working horse farm! The place was very accommodating and quiet, with beautiful horses outside the window. I through enjoyed my 2 month extended stay. The host were welcoming and quickly responsive to my accommodations during my stay. Would highly recommended."
9549,165,"Nicely stocked kitchen. Super comfy bed. Plenty of room to spread out in. The gas fireplace was a nice bonus on a cold day, too!"
9550,165,"For the feedback for the Airbnb!

""Staying at Amy's place was so nice. It was quiet and a perfect place for me and my little ones. It's a great location, it was perfectly clean and had essential items like coffee, toiletries, laundry detergent, dryer sheets. The owner is kind, understanding and was prompt in communicating! I will always come back when visiting the area!"""
9551,165,Great service and very friendly!
9552,165,We had a great long term stay. We had everything we needed and Amy was very helpful and accommodating. Beautiful views and awesome area.
9553,165,relaxing atmosphere
9554,165,The place was so nice and clean and very well appointed with everything needed. The property is gorgeous. It was exactly as described and we were very happy.
9555,165,"The horse farm was fantastic and was even nicer in person than the pictures! Very clean, in fact the stables below are so clean there isn't a hint horse smell in the living quarter at all. The property itself makes for a fantastic stroll and the apartment is very well equipped. I came here with my infant daughter and Amy, the host, was kind of enough to inform me they had a booster seat, etc. A great place for a weekend getaway and we will surely return one of these days!"
9556,165,As described. A comfortable stay in a picturesque place.
9557,165,"Communication was fast, the apartment was really well equipped with everything that we needed and we cooked every night. Loved spending the evenings feeding the horses carrots and the dogs were so friendly it was nice to be greeted when we returned from our days outings. Thank you again so much for an enjoyable week!"
9558,165,This is a great place to stay. Amy is a great host. She made sure everything was perfect for our stay. Very clean. The apartment is located on a beautiful piece of property in horse country. You are staying on a working horse ranch.....very fun experience.
9559,165,Cozy apartment in a beautiful location. Amy was working when we pulled in and greeted us and gave is directions to get settled. The apartment itself was clean and even better than the pictures in my opinion. Kitchen and bathroom were well stocked and everything else was very comfortable and relaxing
9560,165,"Amy’s place was great for a quick visit with family in Southern Pines. She was great communicating ahead of time with clear instructions. She met us in person with a warm and friendly welcome.

The place is so spacious with really cute horse related decor. It’s very cool to wake up and realize that you’re actually staying on a horse farm connected to the barn.

Amy thought of anything and everything you could need. I would highly recommend this for anyone looking for an interesting place to stay with all the amenities of hone and more."
9561,165,Perfect location for our stay to attend a wedding in Southern Pines. Loved seeing the horses and dogs. The hosts were very friendly and communicated well with us. Definitely recommend this place! Will stay here again in the future.
9562,165,"Surrounded by beautiful scenery, stay in a very spacious place with a great kitchen for cooking meals, and Amy was a super welcoming host. What more can you ask for?!"
9563,165,Amazing place in every aspect!
9564,165,"This place has everything you need! We loved our stay and would absolutely stay again. I would recommend bringing your own pillow if you need more neck support, but otherwise we were very comfortable!"
9565,165,Very peaceful and beautiful horse country
9566,165,A gorgeous location! Felt great to be surrounded my nature and watch the horses run around the fences. So many great kitchen supplies that made cooking dinner very easy. Great space and amenities that make it feel like home.
9567,165,"For those who seek a great yet unique retreat, Amy’s place is exceptional. In a comfortable apartment above the horses, you’ll be surrounded by the glory of the Sandhills. Beautiful, restful and memorable describe my 3 nights."
9568,165,Beautiful farm. Will stay here again if I'm ever in the area.
9569,165,"Amy's place is so nice! She is absolutely incredible to work with. I had to leave early and she was so sweet about it. She was really helpful, it felt more like staying with family than renting a space. So glad I found Amy's place!"
9570,165,"Amy's barn apartment is fantastic, inside and out! Very spacious and stocked with everything we needed. Beautiful views of the horses and property from the living room window. We were greeted and sent off by the best dog in the world and got to hang out with their amazing farm cats. Loved everything about our stay. Thanks again, Dragstra's!"
9571,165,Fun place to stay; loved waking up and looking out window and seeing the horses. Great communication and hospitality!
9572,165,"We loved our 1-night stay. Amy’s place is a horse farm located in a small cluster of other horse farms in a flat and beautifully forested area of North Carolina between Fayetteville and Southern Pines. The apartment was larger than expected and extremely clean, and had all the needed amenities including coffee, tea, a fully furnished kitchen and even unexpected useful items such as a child’s booster seat. There was a relaxing TV room with the best overstuffed recliners. Internet worked great. The view from the window of the apartment of the sunrise and the working horse area was a delight. Amy and everyone we encountered were incredibly welcoming and friendly, but also allowed us privacy. Our 1-year old loved watching the horses and also the two friendly dogs on the property. The apartment was so great for a 1-year old as it was very safe for her to wander in without any sharp corners or clutter and with soft carpeting! I would definitely stay here again!"
9573,165,A beautiful horse farm with a very homey and spacious private apartment! The hosts are super nice and welcoming. I stayed here for a weekend and loved waking up to the views in the mornings. This will definitely be a go-to place for my weekend getaways in the area in the future.
9574,165,Apartment for us perfectly and we loved our stay here! The host family was very welcoming as well as their 2 friendly dogs:) we loved the views and saw many deer around here! The location is awesome as southern pines is just a few minutes away!
9575,165,"What an amazing place, I stayed just over 60 days and loved it. The house has everything you need to stay for a short time or a long time! Everything was perfect!"
9576,165,"Great value. Superb bed, recliner and kitchen. Beautiful farm. Classy people."
9577,165,"Excellent value & hospitality. Extra comfy bed and TV recliner. High end range in large kitchen. Adequate WiFi, but had some cell phone connection trouble on rare occasions. Wish we had brought our Ooma [VoIP] telephone. Roku worked swimmingly. Loved the rural ambience and magnificent horses. We enjoyed our stay."
9578,165,"Amy’s farmhouse apartment is a great place to stay. The property is beautiful, the horses are fun to watch and the space is perfect. We spent 10 days there and highly recommend this Airbnb."
9579,165,We were driving from Norfolk to Virginia to the middle of Georgia. With all the violence going on we chose this location and we're extremely satisfied. We would stay there again. The house was great. Apartment was clean. It is the only Airbnb I have been in which has ice and courtesy drinks in the refrigerator. Loved it. Full kitchen. Believe this is in a converted Barn and certainly would return.
9580,165,"Amy and her husband were very kind and helpful. They have a beautiful horse farm that is out in the country if you want to get away from the city. But not too far at all from stores and restaurants. (15-25min). The apartment has everything you need from a refrigerator to an oven and microwave so you can cook if you do not feel like eating out. Nice layout of the apartment as there are plenty of places to relax. Great for couples and even kids. For being on a farm and staying above the stables, there was ZERO smell! Which was something we figured we would encounter. Overall great place and would definitely come back."
9581,165,We loved this place!! We’ve been watching the Netflix show heartland!! Very cool to stay in a place kinda like it lol miss Amy and her husband are very welcoming and all-around great people with two awesome little kids we love watching play in the round pen super cool!!! 😎 probably the best cop of coffee watching them play very cool!! Not one bad thing could be said!! Great location for anybody wanting to visit their soldier super close to brag super close to Walmart and other attractions!!!! Highly recommended!!
9582,167,"The place was very clean, comfortable and private. Hosts very responsive!"
9583,167,"Great stay- lovely apartment and grounds. Perfectly clean, spacious, and updated. Wish our travels allowed us to stay longer but will be glad to return."
9584,167,"Kathy and Don's loft was perfect for my stay. I had to book at the last minute and they accommodated me and Don met me personally and helped me get my stuff into the house. The loft over the cool garage was very well done with great craftsmanship, super clean, and cutely decorated. Was a very peaceful evening. In the morning I sat on the upper deck and drank my coffee looking at the beautiful azaleas in bloom. Thoroughly enjoyed myself....and hated that I could only stay one night.
I highly recommend this place to other couples or business travelers like myself.
Thanks again Kathy and Don for such a great stay.
Blessings."
9585,167,Awesome stay at Above & Beyond! Very friendly host that makes you feel welcome and relaxed. Definitely would stay again.
9586,167,"There is so much to say about this place! Family personally greeted us at at arrival. Everything’s is exactly as pictured with goodies left for your stay. Everything you could possibly need is provided for you. Local menus to restaurants at your finger tips for eating in or out. So cozy, we wished we were staying longer. Feeling of country but close to town. Would definitely stay again. Don’t hesitate, just book it!"
9587,167,Very nice place. We will be back.
9588,167,My stay was pleasant and peaceful. I had everything I needed. I felt pretty safe as well.
9589,167,"Our stay exceeded our expectations. It was a beautiful stay and very cozy. Kathy was very nice and she provided us with everything we could’ve needed and more. I hope to stay again but for a longer period of time in the future. I would highly recommend staying. Me and my fiancé really loved the space, privacy and the aesthetic! I wish we would’ve had time to stay longer. Thank you so much!"
9590,167,"Simplicity and convenience at its finest. HomeAway is well appointed with plenty of coffee/creamer and blankets for those chilly mornings. The full size washer/dryer is great too.

When we noticed a problem with one of the two the TVs, we notified Kathy and she responded quickly.

A couple of quirks we noticed
There is only one small window in the door to let in light. There are no windows to open and allow airflow.
The bathroom mirror is low, best for those 5’2” or shorter.
The shower height is good, but it’s small/narrow/awkward because of the built in beach seat.

For it’s simplicity and convenience, we will likely stay here again in the future."
9591,167,Kathy was very responsive and welcoming. It was clean and exactly as advertised. We would definitely recommend and stay here again!
9592,167,Second time here and will come again. Great location when visiting Campbell University
9593,167,"Enjoyed my stay. Very clean and organized. My only complaints are:

• listing said there would be wine for guests, and there was none. I was looking forward to that.

• There is no good place to eat dinner inside the room"
9594,167,"I must apologize about not having a bottle of wine in the apartment, I was unable to shop due to having Covid, I will make sure I stock up in case that is ever an issue again.
There is an eating table with two stools in the eat in kitchen that you can sit at and talk to someone across from you or watch the television while you eat. I am very sorry you did not find that accomodating."
9595,167,We really enjoyed our stay at Above and Beyond. The location was very peaceful and relaxing and the place was super clean and cozy. We woud definitely stay again. Thanks Kathy!
9596,167,Absolutely beautiful suite. Modern remodel. Thought of everything. Very nice toiletries.
9597,167,"My daughter and I absolutely LOVED our stay at the “Above and Beyond”! We were just passing through and just needed a lovely spot to rest up. Kathy yet above and beyond what I thought. It was so peaceful, so dang cute inside and just felt so comfortable. I would highly recommend staying here. Thank you, Kathy for such a wonderful stay. You really made the experience fantastic!"
9598,167,"Erin, I am so happy to hear this and we are so thankful that you guys decided to stay with us!!! It was a pleasure having you both!"
9599,167,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Hubby & I stayed here for three nights to attend our daughter’s wedding. For those who might be attending at the same venue, it was held at The Barn at Broadslab in Benson and was an easy 20 minute drive. Getting to downtown Raleigh took us about 40 minutes. The home is just as pictured: a very clean one bedroom loft apartment with practical layout. The vibe was similar to staying at an all-suites business hotel but with the charm of country living.
PERFECT FOR: A young couple with no kids or single person.
PERHAPS NOT FOR: Anyone with mobility issues for climbing lots of stairs while carrying luggage, little children, or people who need a larger shower access.
WHY WE LOVED IT: The apartment had everything we needed without the clutter of things we didn’t. Kathy even provides a little toiletries bag in case you forgot something, a bottle of wine, numerous snacks, and even breakfast sandwiches in the freezer.
BOTTOM LINE: Book now, you won’t regret it!!"
9600,167,"If you want to cook dinner, they have everything you need! Great little getaway. Pictures didn't do it justice, it's really adorable!"
9601,167,Loved the place and thought it was even nicer than the pictures portrayed. We would definitely stay again!
9602,167,Another fantastic stay with a perfect location for us. Very clean and comfy. Just enough of everything to make our stay enjoyable.
9603,167,Kathy was extremely hospitable and made sure my parents had everything to make them comfortable. 100% will use them again for any friends/family that come into town.
9604,167,"Thank you for the great review, we certainly appreciate it. Congratulations, Mr and Mrs Mason told us, they seemed so excited. We would be happy to host them anytime they come back, they were delightful!!!"
9605,167,"After staying there for two nights, I have a HUGE COMPLAINT — that I didn’t stay longer. This place was perfect. If I had to say anything even mildly negative, it would be the shower is a little small, but that’s only because I’m a giant. If you’re a normal sized human, it’s great… Would love to live there it was sooooooo nice!!!!!!!"
9606,167,Perfect place to stay in with your significant other. 100% recommend to first timers and couples
9607,167,Great place to stay if you’re in the area. Clean and cozy.
9608,167,"Ok—This property (Above & Beyond) is named appropriately! The place is immaculate and beautifully decorated.
The sofa coach/sectional was sooo comfortable.
Our host literally thought of everything, including red and white wine, assorted K-cups and creamers! The single cup Keurig coffee maker and creamers were a huge blessing!
I loved having access to a washer and dryer right there and was able to do a couple of small loads.
This is such a great place to stay—we will definitely be back!!"
9609,167,Perfect place when visiting our son at Campbell. Had everything we needed and more…. And very close to campus
9610,167,This is a wonderful place to stay. A lot of thought and care has gone into making this a beautiful and comfortable space. I would stay here again without hesitation.
9611,167,"My spouse and I were looking for a place in the area for a family wedding. And we mostly were just in and out and pretty much there just to sleep. But oh my goodness it’s beautiful! And the kitchen is amazing!! You have plenty of counter space to do some cooking or baking, the living room is extremely spacious! Bathroom is beautiful and well maintained, shower is a bit tight from the seating inside but the seating is a bonus! Bedroom was a good fit for us we loved that there were no windows so it stayed dark into the early morning. Highly recommend this stay!!"
9612,167,"An oasis in the middle of an area that does not have many hotels. After driving from the TN Mountains and spending the afternoon and evening with our daughter at Campbell University, we arrived after dark. The driveway provided ample room for parking. The stairs to the entrance were easy to navigate with easy key code access. But the surprise was how nicely laid out and well stocked we found the apartment. Kathy even provided wine which was a much appreciated way to end the evening. We will be very happy to stay there again when visiting our daughter."
9613,167,Very clean and comfortable. Great host!
9614,167,Did not actually have the chance to stay here because of Hurricane Ian. Kathy was beyond accommodating of our circumstances and advocated on our behalf to Airbnb so they we would receive a full refund even though we had to cancel day of. Really hope to stay here in the future.
9615,167,"Can’t say enough about Kathy’s place and how perfect it was for our 3 night stay. The place was extremely clean, comfortable and had so many extras. Some of those included bathroom soaps, plenty of linens, washer/dryer, great Wi-Fi, recommendations for local restaurants, and more. Kathy definitely went “Above and Beyond” for our stay!"
9616,167,Nancy and Don were excellent. Very kind and place was immaculate. They were great to just hangout with. Had a great time. Recommend this to anyone that passes through the area. Beautiful quiet and relaxing . Thank you both for having me. Your awesome 👍 😃
9617,167,Awesome place to stay! Highly recommend! Such a cute area too!
9618,167,"Beautiful place perfect for a couple or a solo visit. Kathy and her husband were amazing hosts and offer a lot to do on the property and options around town. Very clean, amazing and well equipped kitchen, room, and living room. 100% recommend for anyone crossing through the city of Dunn. Thank you for our stay! Hope to be back soon."
9619,167,"It was a great stay at Kathy’s Airbnb, it was a safe area, a very clean place and Kathy was very helpful since the beginning of booking the air bnb. Would definitely stay there again!"
9620,167,"super cozy place, Kathy went out of her way to make our stay perfect."
9621,167,"We loved this stay. A very new, comfortable remodel. Our host thought of everything we needed. I would love to stay here again."
9622,167,Great place and location. Highly recommend.
9623,167,"An absolutely perfect accommodation ! The hosts have truly gone “above and beyond “ creating their Air B&B !
Highly recommended !
Clean, quiet, nicely decorated and everything you could need has been provided !"
9624,167,"Kathy was quick to respond to our reservation request and followed up with check in instructions right before our arrival. Kathy made herself available to answer any questions without being intrusive. The apartment was very private, quiet, and super clean. The lighting was great and the ceiling fans were extra nice. The sheets were very comfy and high quality. There are lots of electrical outlets throughout the apartment—plenty for all of your electronic chargers, sound machine, and the like. My husband stated that the apartment has the “luxury look and feel for the women, and just the right amount of a rugged look for men (wooden headboard, tables, chest, and shelves in kitchen.” We would recommend Kathy’s place to anyone looking for a quiet retreat with all the amenities you will need.

The location just happens to be my husband’s hometown, and we were there to attend a family wedding. We visited 2 local businesses, and they were extremely friendly, helpful, and accommodating when we had our breakfast and did a little shopping."
9625,167,The barn was a great place to stay. The space was just enough for one or two people and if you find yourself in that area it’s a great option. Only downside is if you arrive when it’s dark it can be a little difficult to find because there aren’t any street lights around but otherwise was a great stay. If you have a large or heavy suitcase be aware of the amount of stairs.
9626,167,This was the perfect place for our stay. Excellent location and exceptionally clean this home had everything we needed! We hope to be back many times!!!
9627,167,"Our stay was great they truly live up to the title of the place, you won’t be disappointed"
9628,167,Enjoyed our visit with Kathy. She is a great host and easy to communicate with. She has a lovely home and I hope to visit again. I appreciate all she has done to make her home very comfortable.
9629,167,"Exactly as advertised, we had a great stay!"
9630,167,Kathy’s home is perfect. Everything you could ever want. She even provides the extra items. Kathy and her husband are so very friendly. They go out of their way to make your experience the best possible.
9631,167,Kathy has been a great host. She is very easy to communicate with. Her home is clean and located on a beautiful piece of property. She has everything you need to have a wonderful visit.
9632,167,Excellent place to stay if you’re going to a wedding at The Wilkins Farm in Coats. Very convenient. Kathy was awesome and super accommodating - the space was immaculate!! We had a wonderful stay!
9633,167,"The best. Really, just the best. If we could have stayed longer, we would have asked. An amazing place: very very clean, cool location, and great hosts. The apartment has everything you'd need. Very mad at myself for only booking one night. I hope we can come back."
9634,167,"This was my moms first experience and she was blown away on how amazing this place was. I am pretty sure she would have been fine with me leaving her to stay there forever.
Kathy was so accommodating, we arrived later than planned. Her place is so welcoming, wish we would have gotten in earlier to enjoy the wine and beautiful scenery outdoors."
9635,167,Great place. Would highly recommend.
9636,167,"Great communication, super clean, comfortable and friendly hosts."
9637,167,Kathy was great and her place was wonderful! I enjoyed my stay.
9638,167,Responsive and a great host
9639,167,"Kathy and her husband were amazing! I messed up with mapping out our trip, and she let us check in early to help us out. Super clean and cute spot in a relaxing setting! The property is beautiful"
9640,167,Stayed here multiple times always a great place
9641,167,I can honestly say this was the best Airbnb I have ever stayed at. It had everything thing my wife and I could have wanted. It was so very clean you would have thought it was just built but didn't smell of new paint or over powered air fresheners. The washer and dryer we super helpful as we had run out of clean clothes.
9642,167,We really enjoyed our stay here. It’s exactly as advertised and more
9643,167,Great place great people
9644,167,"Kathy’s place was great! My husband and I were in NC for a livestock show and it was super close to where the show was! Next time we are up, we definitely will be back!"
9645,167,"Kathy's place was cute, just spacious enough, clean, and very comfortable. Great place to stay!"
9646,167,absolutely love this place!! i can’t wait to come back and stay again!!
9647,167,"i just wanted to say that i absolutely loved my stay here! it was my first time visiting the area and i was hesitant about using airbnb, however kathy was extremely friendly and the place was beautiful! just as it was pictured! everything that was offered was available and the bed was extremely comfortable! as well as the couch! they offered complimentary coffee and water too. thank you so much kathy for being a great host! i will definitely be back again and would recommend this place to everybody!"
9648,167,"Amazing place. It’s clean and modern, they provide free coffee which was a big for me!! Lol. Also the outdoor area is so calm and peaceful. I would recommend to anyone visiting in the area and I plan to book here every time I come down from now on."
9649,167,"Thank you so much for your feedback. The kitchen trash can is located under the sink, but maybe I should note that in the Guest Welcome Sheet!!!
You were an awesome guest and welcome here anytime!!!"
9650,167,"Perfect place for us to crash while on our trip, we have a nice and cozy stay!"
9651,167,"Great stay, excellent communication, and highly recommend."
9652,167,"The host was nice and greeted us with a smile. This listing was beautiful, quiet and like the pictures. They had kitchenware for us to use during the stay as well. We left a few items during our stay and she was nice enough to return them to us. I would recommend this listing if you looking for a private & quiet stay."
9653,169,"The space provided was exactly as described. The hot tub is a wonderful touch, the shower is a beautiful way to stay in touch with nature but not TOO in touch with nature. It did get cold on the final day of our stay and it made using the shower extremely off putting but for this time of year a 50 degree day is rare and the weather cannot be controlled of course. Instructions were clear, the fire pit was wonderful too. It has a thorough camp vibe to it, down to the lack of cell phone reception which makes it super easy to unplug and unwind. Totally recommend for singles or couples staying outside Wilmington."
9654,169,"Great get away spot from the city! Loved the binder that she has with instructions, about the animals, as well as places to visit!"
9655,169,A great place to stay. They've done a nice job with the place.
9656,169,absolutely beautiful did a great job
9657,169,"Great stay! The shipping container is tucked in the woods and perfect for a couple’s getaway. We loved the hot tub, the bed was comfortable, and the recommendations were awesome! Flaming Amy’s was our favorite local spot. Definitely suggest for all to visit!"
9658,169,Small but beautiful. Perfect for a couples getaway.
9659,169,"if you're looking for a quiet, peaceful place with you or one other person in your life to just get away from it all , this is a little slice of heaven. I never wanted to leave , but I wouldn't recommend more then one or two because it is small but perfect for couples. I definitely will be staying here again."
9660,169,"Absolutely wonderful, so peaceful it felt so cozy. it’s exactly how it’s listed i loved it."
9661,169,Loved the container home hope to come back one day for a longer stay!
9662,169,"Rented this cute little tiny house with my boyfriend for our anniversary and it was perfect! Amber set the house up with EVERYTHING we could need and more. It made the trip so effortless and relaxing. I loved the hammock and the hot tub was all set up and so nice! The animals were awesome to wake up to as well, and they were actually very friendly. We were able to play with the cute doggies too. I don’t know how you could find a more home-like, clean, and relaxing airbnb. Very grateful that we could stay here and could not recommend more."
9663,169,"Everything was as displayed! Very nice place for a couple, for the price it’s exactly what it is!"
9664,169,"This was a perfect Valentine’s getaway. We live downtown and just wanted to get out of the city; recharge and relax. The binder that Amber made was so informative and perfectly detailed (we loved the section of all of the animals they have!)

We got in later than expected but started with marshmallows at the fire pit. Then warmed up in the hot tub before heading in for the night.

We got lucky with the weather being 70° in February the outdoor shower was amazing in the morning. We got to see all of the goats and the cute pig!

We are definitely going to be back! Thank you!!"
9665,169,"Great quiet spot, very clean. We loved the hot tub!"
9666,169,It was an amazing stay. Great way to get back to the basics and live with minimum things. She had everything you needed in such a small space.
9667,169,"This is an awesome little getaway for a relaxing trip. It is a very pretty place and cool amenities such as outdoor shower, grill, fireplace, and hot-tub. We will definitely be back!"
9668,169,This place is a hidden gem! My husband and I were much in need of a getaway. This was the perfect place. The house was beautiful. We loved the hot tub. Most of all we loved the farm animals and the tour that Amber gave us. Amber went above and beyond and we can’t wait to go back.
9669,169,cozy space with a beautiful view of the farm
9670,169,Great get away to disconnect from noisy world and rest in quiet. The farm animals were an added bonus!
9671,169,"What a nice time we had, the place at night is beautiful, easy to see stars and the moonlight!
The sunset was gorgeous! There is some back and forth traffic on the property but not really disturbing the stay.
The way the host has converted this place and built it out is beautiful, the shower was perfect! And the hot tub area too! We stayed a short time but tried to enjoy every inch of the place, it was awesome! Thank you!"
9672,169,"My friend and I stayed here for one night and we had a wonderful time! It was such a cute space and the hot tub was so nice to sit in, especially on a cold night. Amber was super accommodating and helpful and we would definitely love to stay there again. It was a nice little cozy winter getaway near the beach with the added bonus of getting to see some super cute animals. Thanks again!"
9673,169,Great getaway
9674,169,What a wonderful place to relax. The location is beautiful and I highly recommend relaxing in the hot tub. It is a perfect getaway to check out from electronics and phones and really take in nature. The book provided to us with local restaurants was amazing we choose to go to Flaming Amy’s and were not disappointed. We loved that the book also contained pictures and names of all the animals so when we woke up the next morning we could see who was who. The dogs even stopped by a couple times making there rounds around the farm. The directions provided were very easy to understand and the location was easy to find with the gps. The check in process was simple and easy just like the check out. We regretted on my staying one night here and we will definitely be returning for me. Thank you for an amazing stay the property was gorgeous as well as the accommodations.
9675,169,This was the perfect stay for my Birthday weekend! My boyfriend and I did a “One Tree Hill” tour and loved coming back to enjoy a fire and hot tub. We will definitely be making this a tradition stay. Thanks for everything!
9676,169,"Great spot for one night! Wish I had two because I didn’t even use the hot tub and that was one of the main reasons I booked it! Ended up building a fire to cook dinner instead which was bliss.

One thing of note that doesn’t take any stars away from my review of the place - you are in the country in a small town. Not sure if it is hunting season or just folks doing what they do, but I heard gunshots consistently for a few hours but could tell it was at least a mile away. I have friends who are vets or who have had bad experiences who are sensitive to that sound and activity so just want to make a note of that.

Loved the place - it was spotless, had everything I needed, and a sweet little orange cat came to hang out a few times. 10/10"
9677,169,"The house was very clean, the price was a lot cheaper than staying at a hotel with more amenities and the farm wasvery relaxing. We will be staying here again!"
9678,169,Always great
9679,169,If your looking for a nice quite getaway to wind down and free your mind this would definitely be a great location for you. Cook something over the fire and enjoy some music then relax in the hot tube I definitely enjoyed myself.
9680,169,By FAR my favorite air b n b to date. The place was so clean & peaceful. The outdoor shower was AHHMAZING. Amber was so kind & the check in process was smooth. Will definitely be back.
9681,169,They stay was amazing!! Everything was exactly how it looked and better! Amber was a great host and quick to answer!!! I would stay again!
9682,169,We had an amazing time on our little getaway! The farm animals were a good mixture just to see when we were coming and going. Communication was super fast and they gave us ideas of different things to do around the town if we wanted which was pretty nice! Overall great experience and we’ll be coming back very soon.
9683,169,It was a cute little one night escape
9684,169,The house was everything I imagined it would be. A great place to go completely off the grid and reset yourself with nature. I can’t wait to boom with them again!
9685,169,What a Magical Place! We felt so welcomed after a long trip. Such a unique place! Loved waking up in nature!! Our favorite animal was Rosco! He is the best! We are looking forward to booking again with Amber. She went above & beyond! What an amazing experience!!
9686,169,"This place was awesome!! Best tiny home ever!!Loved the fire pit with a view and the outdoor shower with a view as well. Plus the animals are all so friendly, especially Pete....he's the best cat ever. Thanks for letting us stay there. We will definitely be back sometime soon."
9687,169,Very cute and cozy stay! Definitely would stay again!
9688,169,"The tiny house was perfect for a couple. It is very cute and has everything you need for a weekend away. We made a fire in the fire pit, sat in the hot tub, and watched the goats graze in the morning. A friendly rooster and dog came to visit in the morning. Amber was very responsive to questions and needs. We would definitely stay again if we are in the area."
9689,169,Such a cute and cozy space! I love the uniqueness. We attended a wedding in Wilmington and it was just a short drive. The place was super clean and the hosts are SO responsive and accommodating!
9690,169,"Absolutely loved the cabin, it was so cosy and extremely comfortable. One of our favourite stays! The fire pit, gas grill and hot tub were such a treat. Such a peaceful place, made better by all the animals :) highly recommend!"
9691,169,"Lovely, clean, serene place! Wonderful host Amber was quick to respond. Hot tub was delightful in the fall weather. Great place to have a fire and there were even marshmallows and skewers provided which is a thoughtful and thorough touch. We ate farm fresh eggs which were in the fridge!!! (which has a small freezer section I didn’t see at first.) The shower was lovely even though not closed in. My friend and I plan to stay here again with more time to go to the beach which is near. :)"
9692,169,"One of the best tiny places I’ve seen yet
Great location
Great hosts
Highly recommend
We will be back!!!!"
9693,169,we definitely enjoyed our stay here. we loved all the welcoming animals during our stay. the city wilmington that has many sites is just 30 mins away so it was pretty convenient. we loved the hot tub during the night time when it was pretty chilly weather but the outdoor shower i definitely recommend during non windy hours lol but it was a very good trip & stay here during our time. the animals were a big plus if you’re an animal person :)
9694,169,Thank you for the feedback! We have been talking about putting shutters and heated lights out in the shower so it looks like its time!
9695,169,We enjoyed our time and it was such a nice break away from the day to day hustle and bustle! We will be back!
9696,169,"Great place to stay to deplug for a while! We will def stay there again, was around prefect!"
9697,169,I'm not even kidding this had been the best airbnb experience. Amber did her thing with this space.
9698,169,"The little house was perfect! They possible inch of space was is being used perfectly. The hot tub, and fire pit were our favorites. We did a bike tour while we were in Wilmington, which I also recommend (Wilmington Bike And Brew)
This little stay was an A+++ for my husband and I!"
9699,169,"Cleanest and most well kept place I’ve ever stayed. The hosts were nice, responsive, and accommodated above and beyond. It was cool to get to experience the farm setting, and hitting the beach all in the same day. I will definitely be booking with them again."
9700,169,Thank you! Wanted to get out of town but not too far and this was perfect. Exactly as described. Cute and cozy.
9701,169,"so happy we found this place, it was wonderful"
9702,169,"Our stay in the storage container was absolutely perfect. I proposed to my girlfriend the afternoon prior to our first night! it was only 30 minutes from the beach, which was so nice. the outdoor shower was a really nice touch. we loved reading through the binder with town history, and info on all their sweet farm animals. highly recommend this little gem of a spot!! the mosquitos weren't the friendliest, but the wonderful hostess provided bug spray. I'd say 12 out of 10!!"
9703,169,Thank you! We are glad we could contribute to such a wonderful memory! Congratulations on yalls engagement!
9704,169,Our stay couldn’t have been more perfect! Amber has made this an experience rather then just a stay. She has thought of everything. 10 out of 10 recommend. I had great service on my phone (Verizon)
9705,169,Thank you so much ! Yall come back anytime!
9706,169,"Awesome place - nice, cozy, exactly as described. The fire-pit and hot tub were amazing. There was even the makings for s’mores waiting on us and we throughly enjoyed those.
We had planned to ride to Wilmington to grab dinner but loved the atmosphere so much there that we decided to stay close and go to the local Mexican restaurant that was only 5 mins up the road - great food and cheese dip was on point.
Can’t wait to return and stay longer next time!"
9707,169,Thank you SO much! We hope yall come back again!
9708,169,"The Airbnb was wonderful and a great place to stay. The hot tub, outdoor shower, and other amenities were all very nice. It was pleasant to wake up and see the animals in the field."
9709,169,Thank you Phillip! Come back soon!
9710,169,"Cozy and a perfect size for a weekend getaway. It’s not too far from wilmington or the beaches. The farm animals are friendly (but don’t feed them). The outdoor shower and hot tub are an amazing low-stress way to relax after sight seeing all day. The feeling of privacy and being in nature makes the unit an amazing place to stay, and the hosts are very helpful!"
9711,169,Thank you Kylie! We hope yall come back again! It was great having you.
9712,169,The space was just as shown on the pictures. Tastefully decorated and you could relax!
9713,169,.
9714,173,"Incredible atmosphere and architecture, would be a great place to write a novel. Tami was very gracious and helpful!"
9715,173,The owner was incredibly friendly and accommodating! Beautiful stay and certainly worth the price
9716,173,Beautiful location. Home has been intentionally put together and furnished. Cozy with nice touches across the whole place. Rain shower was luxurious and home filled with light during the day. Surroundings are green and serene. Loved our stay and would return.
9717,173,"Creative, cozy, wooded, and unique. The sauna, wood stove and trails were highlights."
9718,173,This little cabin was really cute and such a relaxing place to stay in!
9719,173,"Cozy and unique place. The sauna, trails, and surrounding woods are wonderful. The home feels like an artist's den. The stay is a destination in itself."
9720,173,Thank you Nayara! So glad you could come and relax.
9721,173,"Very cute, quiet, peaceful place. Loved eclectic feel. Tami was a great host!"
9722,173,We had a nice time.
9723,173,"What a magical retreat and cozy spot—the perfect place for a short decompress, and I hope I can return again sometime soon."
9724,173,"The Bower is an artful, private cabin set in the woods on a truly magical property. Thanks for being a great host, Tami!"
9725,173,Beautiful home and a perfect getaway! Enjoyed the creative art and hiking trails behind the bower! Loved the mushroom pond!
9726,173,Thanks so much Kyle!!!
9727,173,"Tami and Lyle were amazing hosts! Loved the natural sauna, the surroundings were beautiful, Bower was amazing! It was so dreamy, and I absolutely loved every part of the place and if I ever visit back, I've decided to stay only at bower. :)"
9728,173,The Bower is a gem. It’s on a beautiful property and is such a unique and comfortable stay. There’s infinite personal touches and all the amenities you could want. The land is beautiful and the trails are so convenient. Tami is super communicative and helpful. 10/10 would recommend. Especially for the artsy and/or outdoorsy couple.
9729,173,Thanks so much Tachelle! Ya'll were amazingly tidy!! Hope you can come back and enjoy these woods!
9730,173,"The Burrow delites the senses and heals the soul. Surrounded by nature and art it's a peaceful sanctuary for clear thought, prayer and connection."
9731,173,"This was an absolutely beautiful stay, wooded and somewhere between a fairytale and glamping we were comfortable and felt relaxed the entire time. the record player was very fun and the whole environment was charming and ideal."
9732,173,Thank you Peter and yes...let us know next time and we'll go to the garden!
9733,173,Place was better than described. A truly unique getaway. Wish I could have stayed longer.
9734,173,Perfect in every way. I’ll be back!
9735,173,Great place to relax. Beautiful property and cabin. Kinda a woodsy steampunk vibe. If you are looking for a cabin in the woods this place is well worth the stay.
9736,173,Tami was very helpful and communicative in making this last minute stay possible. Thank you for sharing your special oasis
9737,173,"Absolutely fantastic! The Bower was amazing, and so colorful with great artwork throughout the house. The pictures don’t do it justice. The record player and record selection only added to the vibe of the house. The trails were so quiet and gorgeous with all the fall colors and leaves falling. The sculptures throughout the property made it feel as if the house sits in a fantasy movie set, or like something out of Alice in Wonderland. The pond was so fun, the fish are very friendly and swim right up to us, We enjoyed everything very much."
9738,173,"Devan, thank you so much...you are the perfect guest to notice all the ""Alice in Wonderland"" features! Thanks so much for coming!!!"
9739,173,Very scenic and relaxing stay
9740,173,Great place off the beaten trail. Well kept and perfect for the weekend. Thanks Tami!
9741,173,It was a great vacation getaway!! It’s a beautiful corky home that has amazing art work! Had a great trip will be back soon!!
9742,173,A nice getaway from the city and suburbs. Very quiet and relaxing also.
9743,173,Bed was comfy
9744,173,Beautiful place to chill out and spend time in nature. Loved the stay and can't wait to go back!
9745,173,This is the one! Book now and you won’t regret it. Promise ;)
9746,173,"Beautiful place, love the indoor decoration and the architecture. Great for a quiet weekend."
9747,173,Thank you Stane!
9748,173,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Bower. It's the perfect place to relax and enjoy the solitude of nature. Though rustic and quirky, I had everything I needed to feel ""at home"". A great kitchen workspace, internet, and a super comfy bed were just some of the pluses. Listening to music on the old-fashion record player brought a bit of nostalgia too. I checked out the historic town of Pittsboro (12-minute drive) and enjoyed a fun time at The Plant for ""Market Night"", which had live music and vendors. Also, if you're looking for a swimming spot, I recommend the lovely Parkers Creek Beach on Lake Jordan. I would definitely come back!"
9749,173,Very cute place to stay. A unique spot with lots of charm.
9750,173,We had one of the most peaceful weekends that we've had in a long time. The Bower was a great spot to unwind and write and paint and enjoy nature. We loved the sculptures and the workshop close by. Highly recommend staying here if you need to decompress from a stressful time.
9751,173,"My husband and I spent time outside of the property exploring the lovely woods, decorated with some very interesting metal sculptures.
The woodstove smell inside of the property could be overpowering for those with sensitivities."
9752,173,The land is magical ;) Loved it and will be back soon! The hosts are very nice and there’s a lot of land to explore and fun things to do.
9753,173,"Highly recommend this lovely place! Great for solo trip, romantic getaway, or family vacation."
9754,173,"Tami's place was a nice reprieve from the busyness of travel. It's set well off the road, deep into the forest. Lots of quiet and natural wildlife. Decompress with a few sessions in the wood-fired sauna. Sit outside on the top deck (near the bedroom) and stick your head in the clouds. The full-size bed is wicked comfortable (note full-size). The interior has that natural shabby chic style, concrete floor, comfortable furniture, no microwave (as noted), small refrigerator, strong wi-fi, A/C or heat as needed. There are critters (millipedes and spiders) around so get comfortable with nature. There was some light construction nearby but always starting later in the morning (very thoughtful). Trails and metal work abound so grab your camera and capture your next art piece for the home. Overall, thumbs up."
9755,173,"The Bower is a charming, eclectic little cottage in the woods. If you are looking for a quiet, relaxing place to stay, you've found it! It is almost a half mile off the main road, surrounded by woods and farmland. It has plenty of amenities like fast internet, a laundry and a well equipped kitchen, but it does not have a microwave or a TV (which was fine by me!) The walls are adorned with local art and the yard and surroundings have amazing steel sculptures and a large, beautiful steel sculpted chess set. It is a short drive to the town of Pittsboro and close enough to Raleigh to be a great alternative to staying in a noisy, overcrowded hotel. I would definitely stay there again. Tami is a wonderful, attentive host and will ensure you have a wonderful stay."
9756,173,Thank you so much William!!!
9757,173,The bower is an incredible hidden gem! The pictures truly don’t do it justice. Every inch of the place is decorated with art and little touches to make it feel like a home away from home. It’s the perfect place for a relaxing weekend in the woods. We stayed for three nights and can’t wait to come back!
9758,173,"So much more than just a spot to spend a few days. You escape into another world full of surprises, mystery, and wonder! Lyle lives next door and was such a gentle soul to our little guy upon arrival, making sure he knew how to feed the fish and enjoy the land.
Hikes at your disposal, art at every corner, outdoor chess, and a wood fire sauna that is an escape within this oasis.
If you dare venture off this wonderland spot....downtown Pittsboro has several gems and The Plant is AWESOME!

Tami provides an oasis like no other!"
9759,173,"What a great way to escape the world. Staying here was like a step back in time to a more simple way of living. Really enjoyed the trails behind the house to get step away and just relax and stretch the muscles. And be sure to research Pittsboro and the Chatham Beverage District (aka The Plant) before you arrive, both are very rewarding."
9760,173,Thank you Greg...so glad you found the trails and took advantage of these amazing woods!
9761,173,Thank you Tami for sharing this wonderful space with us. It was so peaceful and accommodating. The perfect place to celebrate a best friend’s birthday. Hope to come back soon!
9762,173,Wonderful getaway and the most relaxing places to stay when making trips to Raleigh!
9763,173,"Such a cool place to stay. There was lots to explore in the woods and plenty to do in the house, from board games and puzzles to listening to old records. Tami also owns the Plant and I noticed a lot of the artwork is the same as the Airbnb. It made it feel like an extension of the Airbnb which was cool."
9764,173,Thank you Kylie! So glad you all had a good time!
9765,173,The Bower is a special place! I went for a solo retreat in the forest and was not disappointed. The location in the woods with little pockets of interest here and there were delightful to explore. The Bower itself was the type of place that makes you feel like you are part of your surroundings. The decor was fun and whimsical. The bed was a dream! I can't wait to go back and explore some more!
9766,173,"Our stay at the Bower was wonderful!! Very cozy and peaceful, lots of character (Tami’s attention to detail shows) and overall, a cute little spot for a weekend getaway. The sharp knives were a pleasant surprise while we cooked dinner!! Definitely coming back. Thanks, Tami."
9767,173,Tami’s place is super eccentric! The shower is amazing and so is the life sized chess board that’s outside. At night you can hear all the insects and it’s extremely relaxing. Thank you for having us!
9768,173,"I had a wonderful stay at the Bower! It was rustic, idyllic, and eccentric. If you need inspiration or just want to stay in a place that goes back in time a little, this is the place for you! I loved the fire burning stove and roaming the property. It was definitely the most unique Air BNB I've ever stayed in."
9769,173,Thank you Lindsay! And thank you for your suggestions...I'm on it!
9770,173,The Bower was a wonderful place to relax and unwind. It was quiet and I felt warm and cozy during my stay. I will certainly book this property again in the future
9771,173,"If you’re looking for cozy getaway near the Triangle, you’d be hard-pressed to find a better spot than The Bower. Tucked back on wooded acres just outside of Pittsboro, we felt like we were in our own little magical retreat.

The kitchen is well-stocked with dishes, utensils, a gas oven and a small fridge (even tea, coffee beans and some staple spices).

The wood stove was an absolute must for a weekend spent there during a winter storm. The bedroom upstairs stays cooler than the rest of the house, but there are plenty of comfy blankets and if you build a fire in the wood stove the heat carries well.

We’ll definitely be back to further explore the trails and enjoy the sauna on the property (when there’s less wintry mix falling!)"
9772,173,"This house is unique. If you are just looking for a unique stay in peaceful surroundings with it’s own woodland trails this is the place. It also has such a peaceful feel to it that I left completely refreshed after the stress of the holidays and Covid.
My interactions with Tami were warm and helpful. I definitely recommend staying here if you want to embrace the woods."
9773,173,"Our stay at the Bower? Amazing. The space was quirky and unique, uber cozy, with lots of artistic touches. It’s clear a lot of thought and love has gone into this home, and that vibe carries into Tami and Lyle’s other ventures (The Plant is a must-visit!!!). Some bits are a little rough around the edges (stairs are steep, bed is small for two tall wrigglers, land is easy to get lost in), which was all pretty well-advertised and EXACTLY what we were looking for. A tiny slice of paradise for anyone needing a reflective, cozy spot!"
9774,173,"I rang in the New Year at The Bower and it was lovely! I enjoyed hiking on the property, watching birds, listening to records, and doing yoga on the little balcony. It was a great place for a relaxing and restorative weekend, and Tami was an kind and responsive host."
9775,173,"A cozy, artsy, beautiful and quiet cabin! Perfect week away! Tami was responsive and helpful. The space was very clean!"
9776,173,Very Thankful for the fantastic holiday stay at The Bower @ The Bend in the Burrow :) I’m very much looking forward to my next visit!! This place is very unique & special. I’ve only dreamed of something like this until now!! I’ve already recommended this place to several directly.
9777,173,"Hahaha, Scott! That's a lot of ""b's""! We look forward to your return!"
9778,173,Everything is exactly as pictured; the stay is wonderful and Tami was super friendly and helpful.
9779,173,"The stay was absolutely amazing, and just what I needed for a weekend getaway"
9780,173,"Tami’s place was a wonderful getaway from everything. I booked this as a surprise trip for my girlfriend’s birthday, and it was the perfect mix of cottagecore design and modern appeal to make us feel in a world away from everything. We loved learning the history of the burrow and all of the wonderful touches Tami had included.

We used the cast iron furnace to heat the burrow and it was splendid.
I would recommend spending $5 on fire starters from Lowe’s to speed up the process, it helped us get the fire going in five minutes compared to 20 minutes traditionally.

The only small downside were the 15 or so spiders (one baby wolf spider and 14 or so orb weavers) we had to remove from the bathroom. The bathroom has a door which leads outside, where we believe they were entering from. If you fear spiders, be sure to bring bug killer!

Besides that, this was quite the treat! Many thanks again to Tami for ensuring we enjoyed our stay :-)"
9781,173,Rustic and peaceful. A very calm and pleasant experience.
9782,173,"tami, thank you so much for such a wonderful place to stay! we enjoyed every little detail of the quirky and eccentric place from the unique tiles throughout the floor, the fun bathroom and the artwork that was all around! we would highly recommend to anyone!"
9783,173,"Reeves, thank you so much for the kind words. Yes, we love quirky and eccentric!"
9784,173,"Thank you so much for the experience! The house was very clean when I arrived and the bed was so comfy! I enjoyed every bit of the quietness but enjoyed being close to downtown Pittsboro too.

I appreciated the free coffee, music and books. This was my first time staying somewhere by myself near the woods so I was a little nervous but knowing that Tami stayed just down the road brought tons of comfort"
9785,173,So glad you came. We are a safe haven for sure. Come back anytime!!
9786,173,"Rustic cabin just minutes from town but feels like a world away. This was perfect for my mix of work/leisure for a week. WiFi is strong but there is little to no cell signal and no tv in the home, which is perfect for me. The bedroom is small and very dark at night. I enjoyed opening one of the windows and listening to the leaves on a windier night."
9787,173,The Bower was a perfect place to unwind and relax during a hectic weekend. Tami helped me with a birthday surprise that made everything perfect. I wish we could've stayed longer.
9788,173,So glad it went well! Come see us again! tami
9789,173,"The Bower is the perfect retreat away from the world. The location is peaceful and bucolic, but close to plenty of restaurants and things to do in town. Great place to relax and recharge."
9790,173,"Exactly as described! Wanted a quiet weekend away for our anniversary, and we found it here. The record player, deer, and a groundhog kept us company. Only about 15 minutes away from neat little shops in Pittsboro. Lots to explore on the property and so many stars!

One minor thing of note--this is probably the SOFTEST bed I've ever slept on. Soft beds usually give me a backache, but this one didn't, so it must be a great quality!"
9791,173,Definitely worth a visit!
9792,173,What a great place to relax and unwind! The Bower is a wonderful place full of little unexpected joys! It was the perfect retreat for our honeymoon! We plan to go back to enjoy this little piece of heaven!
9793,173,We loved everything about this place! Convenient to get out and go somewhere but still feels secluded. The perfect place to regroup and relax.
9794,173,Thank you Laura! We'll be ready for you!
9795,173,"The Bower was a magical time for me and my lady. As a surprise trip, she was thoroughly pleased. The perfect bnb for us. Super snoochin place, excellent vibes, bliss in the woods at the most unique domicile I’ve ventured to. Can’t wait to go again. When you go, save time to visit The Plant! Breweries, mead, hemp stores, axe throwing, farm to table foods. Pittsboro was a lovely lil town, shoutout to Virlie’s bfast joint, the trip was a blast. Better than expected."
9796,173,"We loved our stay at The Bower! The location was beautiful and quiet, with lots of nature everywhere. We met a friendly dog and walked around the property— it was great! We loved the space, it was very cozy and the little porch above was nice :)"
9797,173,Thanks Rachel!!!
9798,173,beautiful place to stay. very unique. comfy full size bed. and the artwork is beautiful
9799,173,"Great place, lots of charm and beautiful location. Only stayed for a weekend but will definitely come back!"
9800,173,"Fun, extremely outdoorsy environment. Close to bars and grocery stores too."
9801,173,"All,that and more than the description. What a wonderful place! Not far from civilization but remote, perfectly comfortable with great wifi. This homemade house is a tranquil, funky and fun environment and Tami is accessible and very helpful. Planning on returning for a getaway and a swim at Jordan Lake"
9802,173,Thank you Nancy!!! We look forward to seeing you again and connecting!
9803,173,Unique house in the woods. A lot of insects inside the house but other than that we enjoyed our stay.
9804,173,"Very quiet, private, creatively-inspired getaway! Great place to recharge, read, write, create! The little town of Pittsboro is darling!"
9805,173,Loved your artwork!
9806,173,"Tami’s place is fun, artsy, quirky, and in touch with the outdoors. It was one of the most unique AirBnBs we have stayed in. We appreciated all the fun touches and warm hospitality. Tami was very communicative, responsive, and generous. We especially enjoyed hiking through the woods on their property and seeing all the flora and fauna. Tami’s Beverage District venture is not to be missed as well - it’s a short drive from the home. We shall remember our time here fondly!"
9807,173,Ya'll are the best!
9808,173,"Beautiful place in the woods. I worked remotely from here for 3 weeks and wish it had been more.

Trails into the woods from the back door. All kinds of nature around... deer, frogs, snakes, toads, owls, skinks, and more. The sauna was great. Same for the orchard with the fresh blueberries. Tami has created a beautiful, welcoming space here and you're sure to enjoy your stay."
9809,173,Thank you Garrett!
9810,173,"if you want to get away, enjoy some nature and take some deep breaths , you will live this place. it's a perfect mixture of nature and art."
9811,173,Thank you all. :)
9812,175,"Kelly’s beach cottage was the perfect beach getaway. The space was very clean, welcoming and close proximity to the beach. We enjoyed sitting on the balcony each morning."
9813,175,We had an amazing stay! The house is extremely clean! And the perfect space for a vacation! We had our dog with us- we had no trouble walking her around the yard and neighborhood! The owners are extremely sweet and accommodating! We will definitely stay here again!
9814,175,"It was a nice studio. But the bed was not comfortable at all. I understand you want to protect your mattress, but having that plastic cover on it was crazy. Then I thought I could sleep on the futon forget . Also maybe have another area for cleaning supplies in the bathroom had no storage. Last thing the neighbors dogs definitely wasn’t quiet."
9815,175,"Kim, I'm sorry you didn't have the best experience which is what we drive for with every guest. We truly respect every guest's preferences but as you can understand, it will be impossible to please everyone. We think having a plastic cover on a mattress is best to keep the place more hygienic. This is the first time someone says something negatively about it. You also gave us 3 stars for check-in and location. You asked our cleaning person how to access the place when we had sent you all of the instructions/information at 7:40am prior to your arrival as noted/time stamped in the airbnb platform/app. Not sure how you would have missed this info if we were on top of answering all of the questions you had about the area prior to your arrival. We are always a text or call away.  Although OKI is known for a pet friendly island/beach, we are sorry if the  neighbors' dogs weren't quiet during your stay. I hope it wasn't after hours though. We do appreciate the feedback on the futon and we have purchased a new sectional sofa sleeper to accommodate our future guests. We think you guys were great and respectful of our place. We hope we can host you again."
9816,175,Was exactly what we needed for impromptu weekend couples quick get away! Kelly responded very quickly! The place was very clean andconvenient to great restaurants and shops. Would stay again if available when in area!
9817,175,"Kelly’s place is a perfect spot for 1-2 people in beautiful Oak Island. Great location, and great value."
9818,175,We loved that it is walking distance from the beach!! It was very clean and such a cute space to stay while enjoying the beach!! Oak Island is definitely a treasure!! We would definitely stay again!!
9819,175,Well furnished and an excellent location!
9820,175,"Very nice space, easy to access, convenient to businesses and public beach access. Would stay again when we're back in the area."
9821,175,"The space was very clean, easy to locate and check into. They even left a bottle of champagne for us which was a nice touch! overall we really enjoyed our stay and would love to return in the summer."
9822,175,great location and host. perfect place to get away as a couple would recommend.
9823,175,"Lovely spot, very clean and nicely renovated. An easy walk or drive to the beach and very convenient."
9824,175,"I booked Kelly's place for a week over the Christmas holiday. My sister lives nearby so it was very convenient. It was just me and my cat, so it was a nice size for us. it's small, but has everything you need. kitchen, hotplate, grill, microwave, refrigerator, and a Keurig coffee maker that was a godsend. The place has a nice outdoor deck that was wonderful. 2 smart tvs so you can login to your Hulu, Netflix, etc. The futon in the living room is definitely not comfortable, I wouldn't want to sleep on it, but I'm sure a child wouldn't mind. The bed was firm, but comfortable. Her cleaning crew is amazing and the place was extremely clean. They also put a little Christmas tree & some holiday decorations in the apartment for me, which was so thoughtful! I loved it. I stayed during the off-season, but there were still plenty of shops & restaurants open. Very close to the beach, it's easily walkable. Overall, a great little place!! I highly recommend it & Kelly was very friendly. 😺"
9825,175,"Had a good time at a short Thanksgiving holiday getaway. Kelly place was clean, cozy and convenient to beach access. The mini chicken was functional enough for cooking some simple hot meals especially with most restaurants closed at this time. The bottle of champagne was a plus for holiday greetings to us. Kelly was very responsive with text communications. Friendly neighborhood made safe feeling to stay."
9826,175,"Nice space, accurately described.
Easy walk to beach and Old Bridge Diner.
Dog Friendly. Communicative host. Well stocked kitchen. Bathroom was nice.
Bedroom Queen mattress is a memory foam style, which I do not prefer, but fine if you like them .
Futon not very comfortable.
Overall Good stay and Great host."
9827,175,Convenient location and cleanly.
9828,175,We stayed in Oak Island for a wedding and Kelly's place was a perfect little retreat close to the beach! A coastal cottage feel!
9829,175,Very clean space. Perfect for two and a short weekend get away. There is public beach access a 5-10 minute walk away but you do have to cross a busy intersection. Space was well equipped.
9830,175,"Their place was great! Just as described, not far from the beach. There was everything we needed. I appreciated the mini kitchen and fridge!"
9831,175,"Clean, cozy and great location! Kelly was very responsive and helpful with any questions or concerns."
9832,175,"We really enjoyed our stay here! Cute and cozy little beach house with the friendliest neighbors and doggie neighbors! Super close proximity to shops, restaurants, and most importantly the ocean! Would love to stay here again in the future."
9833,175,Prefect for 2 people for a weekend away.
9834,175,Would stay again
9835,175,"the space is small but functional and very clean. we like to make the majority of meals at home during vacation so we planned accordingly for the lack of oven. the grill and electric stove top worked well for our needs. the kitchen sink is very small but again we made it work! make sure you bring all you will need to season or cook with bc all they provided was salt and pepper. a bottle of champagne greeted us upon arrival, nice touch!! the futon is not comfortable at all so if you're the type to spend any time watching TV on vacation, you may want a better couch situation. the beach was 10 min walk one way, straight shot. we drove to public access and had ample parking each day (our trip was after labor day but I love the free parking, so rare these days). the apt is situated conveniently to restaurants, stores etc. perfect place to rent for 2 people. the stairs are steep so be careful! we were grateful to find a place with semi late notice and had a wonderful time at the beach!"
9836,175,Great stay
9837,175,"We loved our stay at Kelly's! My husband and I stayed for 3 nights with our small dog and we were very comfortable. We decided to drive and park at the beach since it was so hot, but you could easily walk if you don't mind the heat. There was tons of parking at the beach, great restaurants (suggested by Kelly), and if you want to eat in — the kitchenette space was perfect for making lunches,"
9838,175,"This place was great. I really loved the area. It was great to travel with my pup and the place was super clean! I opted to drive to the beach and there was enough parking, it would have been about a 10 min walk otherwise. The steps up are a bit steep, makes me appreciate my one story home. The futon isn’t very comfy but the bed was. Kitchen set up is just enough for minor meal prep. Overall, great experience and wonderful communication with the hosts."
9839,175,I really enjoyed my stay!
9840,175,"Perfect place to stay for a weekend getaway! Walk to the beach is a straight shot, and there is public parking as well if wanting to drive to beach. It was very clean and very cozy. The neighbors were very kind, and there were dogs at each surrounding house - only barked when we took our dog out too. We hope to come back again soon!"
9841,175,"Great location, easy check-in. Host is quick to respond to messages and very hospitable!"
9842,175,"We enjoyed our stay, it was very private and quiet.. most of the time, neighbors dogs did bark a lot. The futon was a little uncomfortable and the bathroom was a little dark. It was very roomy for my boyfriend and I. The fridge was a little small but we made it work. The little coffee bar was so adorable! This Airbnb allows dogs and there were no sign of dog hair or smell! On oak island there isn’t much restaurants or much to do. It’s a vacation for being lazy and enjoying the sun/beach. Bed was very comfortable! Beach towels (2) and beach chairs(2) were provided. We didn’t see an umbrella. It’s also a 10 minute walk to the beach, which isn’t bad but since NC is humid it made it worse!"
9843,175,"biking from here to my family’s house was a breeze! this place was cute, quiet, secure! easy peasy and a great stay."
9844,175,"This bungalow near the beach is a great getaway! The accommodations, the cleanliness, the bottle of champagne, everything was perfect for my first beach trip with my little one!"
9845,175,The space was perfect for a long weekend at the beach. Tastefully decorated and very clean. Communication with the hosts was excellent. Would definitely stay here again!
9846,175,"Great sized space for our little family of two adults and two dogs under 25 lbs. Nicely decorated to feel like a sweet little oasis at the end of a busy beach day. VERY clean, and this coming from someone who always travels with their own cleaning supplies. Kelly was very responsive and friendly through chat, and we look forward to booking with her again in the future! 10/10 would definitely recommend"
9847,175,"Beautiful little retreat in an excellent location! We visited this spot over a long weekend and it was absolutely perfect for our needs as a couple with a dog. The space is just enough for a couple and has everything you need to get some rest between beach time, space to cook breakfast and have coffee, and is very pet friendly. The walk to the beach was very manageable, but if you don’t feel like walking or have a heavy cooler, there seemed to always be parking spots available at the dunes. Lastly, this place was very clean. Not a single thing in the house felt dirty. Will be looking to book again next year!!"
9848,175,"Cute decorating and layout, but no comfortable place to sit and poor quality tv reception. The walk to the beach is more like 10 or 15 minutes."
9849,175,Kelly is super responsive and has her place covered with everything you would need!
9850,175,Really lovely spot. Super close to the beach. Our first time in Oak Island and so glad we spent it at Kelly’s place. Super clean!
9851,175,"This was a great place to stay! The kitchen is quite small, but well equipped for two guests. The beach was about a 10 minute walk with gear, but plenty of parking spots at each road end for beach access available.

Great little spot! We would stay again."
9852,175,Great stay!
9853,175,The property is more than 5 min walk to the the beach and you have to cross a busy highway to get there. It’s about 10 minutes away.
9854,175,"We are not surprised with this review. We had an idea that this was not going to be a pleasant experience from the moment we were asked for a discount and how to avoid paying the cleaning fee. Busy highway? There are no highways in OKI. That shows frustration, perhaps because we called on you breaking the rules. You just don't bring two more people to sleep over when the rules says Max 3 people and don't even let us know. 2 Stars for Value? We are very reasonable for the area. At least we hope you enjoyed the free champagne, coffee and bottles of water."
9855,175,Was able to get to the beach easily and the beach was never packed.
9856,175,"My husband and our Goldendoodle stayed at Kelly’s place for our anniversary beach trip. The location is amazing- just a five minute walk to the ocean, in a quiet neighborhood. The room was nice and clean, the bed was comfortable, and the locals we encountered were so friendly! Kelly even had a bottle of champagne for us:). And it’s just so nice to have a place you can stay with your fur baby. You won’t regret staying here- we’d come back again in a heartbeat!"
9857,175,"Great place, great location. We enjoyed the walk to the beach, through a quiet neighborhood with lots of charming homes and big trees. The beach was quiet, as is Oak Island. We’d never been there before and we loved it. Kelly’s apartment had everything we needed, including BandAids 😊. Enjoyed sitting on the deck. Would def stay there again!"
9858,175,"This place is very clean, new, and modern. We enjoyed sitting out on the deck for breakfast and in the evenings! The place was a perfect size for 2-3 people. The kitchen had a combo convention/ air fryer/ microwave plus a 2 burner hot plate to cook. We like having the convenience of breakfasts and evening meals before and after busy days! We would definitely stay again. It was very peaceful and enjoyable! Our first time actually staying on Oak Island."
9859,175,"Kelly's place so quaint and perfect for a weekend beach getaway. It was very clean and super convenient to shops, restaurants, and the beach. I would definitely recommend this place to others visiting the area and I would stay here again."
9860,175,"The house was beautiful, very clean and super quiet. Oak island was a perfect get away, very relaxing !! I will definatly be back!!"
9861,175,"We had such a lovely stay! Kelly was so attentive and responsive if we had any questions. The guesthouse was cute, clean, and quaint. We even got to bring our doxie babies, and they got to go for a few beach walks and loved it! If you need a cute and refreshing beach getaway, look no further than Oak Island & Kelly’s beautiful air B&B!"
9862,175,We had a wonderful stay! It was extremely clean and Kelly was very helpful.
9863,175,Great spot!
9864,175,"Location is convenient to beach, stores, etc. Of street parking, easy checkin, good communications from the host Kelly. Enjoyed our stay."
9865,175,"Space is attached to hosts home, but is perfect for a couples get away and very private! It was cozy and in the best location for our week long stay in Oak Island. We brought our fur baby and the space was very accommodating for her too! Coffee, tea, snacks and even champagne were provided! We will definitely be booking at Kellys place next time we visit the area!"
9866,175,"Kelly is a super host , wonderful location, only blocks away from the beach ( walking distance) The home is so nice and clean, very comfortable bed. Nice kitchen space, very nice bathroom, TV in living area and bedroom, very nice for me since I love laying in bed , watching TV after a long day on the beach, nice deck , with a grill and patio set , everything you’d need to use for cooking. Pet friendly, to us fur parents, that’s important. I enjoyed my stay and looking forward to staying again ! Thanks Kelly !"
9867,175,"Walkable to beach, comfortable, had everything we needed. Small space but utilized nicely. Quiet area with a lot of restaurant choices nearby. We would stay again!"
9868,175,We stayed here for over 2 weeks while looking for apartments. We enjoyed our stay and loved being so close to the beach. Kelly was helpful when we did need anything.
9869,175,We had an absolute wonderful time at Kelly’s place. It was wonderful for our couples get away! We will definitely be on the look out for this spot to be available next time we visit the area!
9870,175,Great space for a couples getaway!
9871,175,Hope to be able to host you guys again.
9872,175,"This place was wonderful! Even in chilly weather, we were able to walk everywhere we wanted/needed to get to. It was the perfect size & space for a weekend getaway. All the necessities were kindly made available by the host. It was SO clean, it smells wonderful. We would absolutely stay here again in a heartbeat."
9873,175,"This Airbnb was exactly what we needed. The place was connected to the host’s house, but still super private and relaxed! It was clean and had every amenity needed for a beach weekend trip, from towels to champagne to streaming channels to oatmeal. It was a short walk to good restaurants for every meal, and an easy walk to the beach. The kitchenette had plenty of room to cook small meals. The bed was comfortable. The couch turned into a futon which allowed us to snuggled with our pet - it was very pet-friendly! We will return if we can!"
9874,175,Find a gem!
9875,179,"This was our 1st Airbnb experience as well as our 1st RV experience. The whole process from booking to communicating with the owners was so easy and made trip planning a lot less stressful for me! Donna and Roy made our trip exciting with special touches around the rv for the kids as well as the parents! The space is very well maintained and though pets are allowed, the place is so well cleaned, there were no lingering odors or damage from past guests or their pets. The backyard had so much space to explore and the firepit area was relaxing to just hangout after a full day of fun. Before we left the kids were already trying to plan our next trip back 😀 Thank-you so much again for sharing your piece of quiet in this busy world! The Forehand Family"
9876,179,"Donna and Roy really made our trip! Such a kind and thoughtful couple. They made us feel like we were at home. Southern hospitality at its finest. Loved the gas fireplace, and the furry throws they have folded up in the living room, perfect for cuddling. First thing I noticed was how roomy the RV is, so if you’re worried about feeling confined, it’s not an issue whatsoever. If you’re looking for a peaceful getaway this RV is so perfect. We will definitely be back."
9877,179,Quiet and cozy get away.
9878,179,I have stayed here for work and love every minute Place is amazing
9879,179,Good location to be away from the trappings of social interaction bout still close enough to Seagrove. Looking forward to returning.
9880,179,"Donna & Roy’s place was extremely private and very peaceful. You get the feel of camping without all the hassle of setting up camp. There was plenty of room to park our boat and truck too. They were very friendly and responsive to any questions and keep a spotless place. The king size bed was very comfortable and a nice addition for a RV! We would definitely stay here again. The outdoor space is a great place to hangout and relax. Thanks for a great stay!
Jim & Pat & Piper"
9881,179,This was my second time staying here and I have to say I love the quiet. I travel for work and will be staying in this place again. The hosts have been awesome during both stays and have went above and beyond to make sure you feel at home.
9882,179,Always such a wonderful stay! They truly go above & beyond to make it enjoyable & they add little personal touches for you ! They’re such wonderful people. You will be completely taken care of. Love staying here
9883,179,"great stay, clean, and a great environment to get away from the noise of hotels!!"
9884,179,"Absolutely fantastic stay! The place was really comfortable and they had all of the amenities available that you could want.

There were a lot of small details that they included (hand written note, snacks, journal book to sign) that really made it feel special.

I left something behind and they shipped it back to me , free of charge and with a little momento included.

My go to location from now on when we stay in uwharrie!"
9885,179,"Thank you for such an awesome review and for the 5-star rating!!

It is so rewarding when our guests acknowledge and appreciate our efforts ... we are really grateful to you for choosing our place for your stay, we look forward to your return and really appreciate you taking the time to submit your review!!!"
9886,179,"my first review because y'all were awesome! The spot was perfect, lousy phone service, but I needed that! (not ur fault) Everything was the bestest! wish u both a Happy New Years! 2023!!!! arrgggg"
9887,179,We were thrilled to have you as our guests in Bigfoot's Backyard during the Christmas holiday ... You were awesome! We are so glad you enjoyed your time here and look forward to welcoming you back!! Thank you so much for the 5-star review ... it really means a lot to us that you found us worthy of and that you took the time to write your first review! Thank you!!
9888,179,The place was wonderful and exactly as described. The hosts were super communicative and there if you needed anything. I would definitely stay there again!!!!
9889,179,"Highly recommend! Very clean, great layout, had a grill and fire pit! What more can you ask for. Wonderful spot for outdoor activities."
9890,179,"Barefoot’s backyard was just as expected. Donna was very responsive, informative, and kind. I was looking for a nice quiet place to escape with my two dachshunds and it was perfect for us. The RV was very clean, well stocked, homie, and quiet. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely consider staying again."
9891,179,"This was the best AirBnB experience we have had. The RV was a unique experience that I think everyone should try. The unit was spotless , well stocked, easy to navigate & the many extra special touches they put in, including a care package of goodies, made us feel as if we were in a cabin instead of an RV. The ""yard"" around the RV was AWESOME, we couldn't get ourselves out in the 19 degree weather, to enjoy the fire pit but will definitely be using it the next time we are there, they even supplied the first nights firewood. The outside amenities were fantastic, grounds are kept up & surrounded by woods for privacy. Although there is a small house at the entrance of the long gravel driveway, it it so far away & has a line of trees between it & the RV you don't know its there. We had one small issue, we contacted Donna & Roy & w/in minutes they were there to fix it. I could go on & on about how incredible this place was but I only have 1000 characters. If we could rate this a 10 we would"
9892,179,"Donna & Roy were awesome host the place was very clean and comfortable. needs a big frying pan , and better small pans that are not scratched up. Hot water runs out very fast . I could not wash a few dishes without running out of hot water. Bed is comfortable. We were there two nights. I defiantly would return again. Loved meeting Donna and Roy at our arrival! Love this place!"
9893,179,"Our description states that our place is an RV. An RV is not designed/equipped like a house or cabin, but is still a great place that provides the camping experience w/comforts of home. The stove in RV's are small. Ours is a gas stove measuring 16"" wide X 14"" deep w/ 3 single burners that make a 4"" circle of flames each. It's not designed to accommodate large pots/pans. We provide 2 standard size frying pans (a 10"" and an 8""). They're scratched from normal use, are still functional, but will be replaced soon. RV water heaters are also small (usually 4-10 gal) compared to those in homes (usually 30-40 gal). We tell all guests that the water heater holds 4 gallons, that it provides enough hot water for one good shower and that it recovers (reheats) in about 30 minutes so they can plan their showers and dish washing accordingly. We're sad that our run of 5-star reviews has ended because of scratched pans and limited hot water which we were transparent about from the beginning."
9894,179,The RV was so nice and Donna & Roy do everything they can to make your stay comfortable. We will definitely stay there again.
9895,179,Second time staying. Owners are very responsive and great. Will stay again.
9896,179,"Bigfoots backyard was the perfect base camp for us during our NC Zoo and Uwharries trip. Donna and Roy were great, the place was very clean, and we had everything we needed. They made it extra special for the kids with smores and a welcome basket. We really enjoyed our stay here and would definitely recommend to others. It's a real gem in this area 💎"
9897,179,"We're thrilled that you enjoyed your time in Bigfoot's Backyard. Thank you for the wonderful compliments, recommendation and 5-star review!"
9898,179,"Bigfoot's Backyard RV is the perfect place to stay in Star, NC...located in the country where it's so relaxing, peaceful and quite...only about 20 minutes outside of Asheboro...the RV is spacious, stocked with everything you need for a perfect stay, extremely clean, and the bed is comfortable...Roy and Donna are outstanding host!...high recommend Bigfoot's Backyard!"
9899,179,"We're so glad you found your time in Bigfoot's Backyard to be peaceful and that the RV met your needs. Your amazing review, thoughtful comments and awesome rating really put a smile on our faces. We look forward to having you back for another stay!"
9900,179,"Donna and Roy are excellent hosts - so warm, kind, and welcoming. They have thought of every little detail that makes an airbnb stay memorable. They are knowledgeable about the area and provide brochures and maps in the RV as far as suggestions go. Don’t hesitate to reach out to them and ask if you have any questions on anything else!

The RV is in a great location if you’re looking for a nature getaway. The nearest trailhead I frequented was about 10 minutes away. It’s quiet and very private, and the fire pit out back is perfect for chilly nights and s’mores.

Staying in an RV was a first for me, but there was plenty of room for me and my cat. The wifi was fast enough for me to work remotely and have virtual meetings throughout the day. The bed is so comfortable, and the kitchen has everything you might need to cook or prepare snacks/coffee. I don’t know how to grill, but there is one outside if you do.

I hope I am able to return sometime soon :)"
9901,179,"Wow...how thoughtful!!! Thank you so much ... your wonderful review, insightful comments and awesome 5-star rating are greatly appreciated!!! It was an honor to have you as our guests in Bigfoot's Backyard ... one we hope to get to experience again someday!"
9902,179,"Our stay at Bigfoot's Backyard was wonderful. So quiet, relaxing and cozy. The evening campfire and the comfort of the RV were a blessing.

The RV is well equipped inside and out, plus was super clean."

9918,179,"Such a cute place for a little getaway. So close to restaurants and Uwarrhie National Forrest, but still tucked away from everything. There was plenty of room for my family of 3 and our German Shepherd. We were able to spend an evening outside grilling and enjoying nature. The fireflies were everywhere! So pretty. It stormed the next night but the sound of rain on the camper roof was also very relaxing. We stayed inside watching movies. The owners literally thought of every way to make the stay awesome! We hope to come back and stay again!"

9929,179,I had a wonderful stay at Donna & Roy’s RV! It’s in a beautiful spot along the edge of Uwharrie National Forest. So quiet & peaceful. They stocked the fire pit for us and even left treats for both me and my dog. It was conveniently located near StarWorks & Seagrove. I highly recommend this luxury camping spot & will stay there again next time I am out that way.

Everything was very clean and there was a lot to do (games, fires, cards, grilling, velcro ace throwing, roasting marshmallows, TV, lots more outdoor activities, and the location was so peaceful and quiet, but not super far from reality! The hosts went above and beyond to make sure our stay was perfect and they were very easy to get in touch with. This was a great way to escape and still feel at home.

9954,179,We're so glad you enjoyed your stay at Bigfoot's Backyard!! We really appreciate the 5-star review. We look forward to your return someday!
9955,179,"The RV spot that Donna and Roy set up is very cool. My friend and I were down from the mid Atlantic area (PA, MD) to hunt on public lands for some game birds. The RV was a nice spot to wind down after our days of driving and hunting. We were there just before a nasty ice storm so all the amenities we utilized were inside. If we were there another season, I’m sure we would’ve enjoyed some of the outdoor setup (fire pit, cornhole, outdoor sink, etc). The location is fantastic…a short drive to trail heads and public lands of Uwharrie, Pee Dee.

The night the ice storm rolled in, the propane/heat went out but Donna & Roy were quick to check up on us, and run a small spare tank over/bring a griddle for breakfast as a backup. They were quick to respond and help out. Very kind and attentive hosts!"
9956,179,We're absolutely thrilled that you enjoyed your time at our RV in Bigfoot's Backyard! Thanks for the 5-star review and the wonderful comments.. we hope you return someday when there is no ice storm :)
9957,179,"Visitors can expect a private, comfortable stay. We had no issues with anything. Wifi connection isn't the best if you need to work, but you shouldn't work-just relax!!!! Donna and Roy are the best hosts I've ever encountered. They care so much that you're comfortable. perfect example of southern hospitality. 👌"

9965,179,"Thanks for the wonderful review and for being such great guests! We really appreciate it! Anytime you need to get away, you're always welcome to come and stay in Bigfoot's Backyard!"
9966,185,The place is very cozy and comfortable. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and Kristen is very nice. The tent is very nice and equipped with everything and the campfire is beautiful.
9967,185,Great place! Definitely coming back!
9968,185,"This stay was exactly what I needed and more. Kristen was very responsive as I made the reservation while en route and at the last minute. Even though I arrived late, the host was there to greet me and orient me to the space. Although, I read it in the reviews, I was doubtful that the space would be as peaceful and feel as isolated as it did in the midst of a neighborhood, but it did. As a solo traveler, safety is most important and I felt that while also feeling like I had the privacy I wanted. It was perfect for my dog and I.

I also appreciated the care and attention to detail of everything that was provided. The little touches really made the place feel quaint and cozy.

I would definitely stay again and recommend to others. This is also a perfect set up for those who are interested in the “camping” vibe but don’t have the supplies and aren’t fully ready to “rough it”.

Highlight: the outdoor shower!"
9969,185,"I had a wonderful weekend here with my dog and has a staycation. It was very peaceful, and despite being on the host property, you still felt like you had a lot of privacy and at the same time felt like they were accessible if needed. The layout the amenities, and everything were very thought out. I will definitely be staying here again."
9970,185,Super cozy tent! We loved getting the inside fireplace going while the day calmed down. The pour over coffee was a great way to start the day too. Cute spot!
9971,185,"A wonderful host! We had such a great time at the tent and Kristen was so accommodating and kind. She provides all the supplies you could need for a fun, relaxing stay. Definitely recommend this Airbnb!"
9972,185,Everything was PERFECT !!! This was amazing I recommend it a 100% !!!
9973,185,The stay at Kristen’s was just what I needed! She was so helpful and the place was so peaceful
9974,185,"Awesome place, thanks for having us."
9975,185,This is a perfect and unique place to get away. It was exactly as listed and described. This stay was a dream of an airbnb experience. Highly recommended!
9976,185,"Definitely worthy of the title Super Host! Right in Kristen's backyard, we felt like we were in another world. It was very cozy, and it was so clear how much thought and care had been put into the space. Everything was cleanly prepared and considered down to the smallest details. We'll most likely be back!"
9977,185,Loved my experience here. I traveled solo and felt very comfortable with my surroundings. Kristen was extremely friendly and helpful and I’m grateful to have stayed here.
9978,185,"This place was perfect! Definitely want to come back for a sweet little relaxing getaway. Kristen was awesome and very accommodating, she even had happy birthday decorations for us when we got there. Place was magic!"
9979,185,Absolutely perfect place. Would definitely recommend to anyone. I absolutely loved it.
9980,185,"The place was really well maintained and clean, and the location was quiet and beautiful. We had a very relaxing time there."
9981,185,My wife and I had an awesome time here. Loved it. Will come back.
9982,185,Kristen was a great host. The place was peaceful and had a good view. The lights outside and inside made the entire experience. It was a great little getaway.
9983,185,"Very pleasant. The hosts put thoughtful touches and nearly everything was provided. They are very responsive.
There are separate sleeping bags but only one bed.
Highly recommend if you're looking for a camping environment in a non-secluded area.
The shower is a very nice set up."
9984,185,"Kristen was such a friendly, accommodating and gracious host! Communication was never a problem as she took the time to answer any and all questions before and during the stay. The space was private, comfy with beautiful scenery and not mention the friendly pond duck, Mr. Quackers. So many extra touches here and there to make the venue/space feel special! The champagne was such a sweet and unnecessary gesture but goes to show how special Kristen is and how she truly cares about sharing this special space with her guests! A must visit if you're looking for something different or off the beaten path for a fun hiking weekend or romantic get-a-way with your special somebody. Thank you!"
9985,185,Very cool space. Enjoyable and comfortable. Kristen has thought through and anticipated so many needs and potential wants for guests. She was very accommodating and really had an excellent space.
9986,185,Our host was fantastic!! She came down to show us how everything worked and explained some of the great amenities (including the shower house!) to us so we wouldn’t be confused. The tent is in a very beautiful area that overlooks the pond. I felt very safe during my trip as it’s a good area and a good neighborhood. I will definitely be staying again!
9987,185,"Wow, I can't begin to list all of the things we loved about staying with Kristen, but I'll try to give a summary.

Kristen is a super cool person who is the rare and awesome balance between being very understanding, generous, and laid back, while being incredibly meticulous and thoughtful. We got stuck in traffic after a long drive, and she waited for us to give us a tour. Unlike us, try to aim to get in before bed time so you can explore and get familiar with the space, though it all worked perfectly for us. I don't know if I've ever stayed at a hotel or airbnb where a host paid such attention to detail. We honestly thought it was incredible.

Kristen set up the fire pit and stove for us ahead of time with wood and starters so everything was easy and ready to light. She made the space look beautiful and welcoming with wine, teas, fancy instant coffee mixes, and lots of lovely touches. She thought of ways to make glamping as convenient as possible with a zero odor toilet discretely zipped up in the corner (doubling as a sturdy chair with a cushion on top), multiple options for heating (stove and two different types of heaters), multiple options for cooking (stove, fire pit, and inductive hot plate), multiple options for bedding and staying warm (which was not a problem at all, we were suuper warm and cozy and could have been perfectly comfortable in much lower temperatures), eye masks for sensitive sleepers who might notice outdoor lighting, and more. I am usually sensitive to mattresses but slept very well on the futon. I was able to have a zoom meeting and watch a movie, so the internet signal was excellent and the work space comfortable. Everything was also immaculately clean.

In addition to all of Kristen's thoughtful touches, we loved the space. The tent feels private and tucked away. We could've spent all day sitting at the fire pit, hammock and seating area looking over the pond. The shower tent is really nice, spacious, clean, and private, with water as hot as you want it. The Mexican restaurant ~15 minutes away was large, had tons of options, is satisfying and reasonable, and that shopping area has a grocery and other stores and restaurants. We spent most of the day reading in the sitting area and at the state park ~10 minutes away, hiking.

There were zero cons to our stay. However, we are outdoorsy and practical people so we are more than comfortable using a portable toilet, wood burning stove, hot plate, etc. Kristen made glamping as convenient, comfortable, and glamorous as I can personally imagine, and I hope people go in being excited and open minded that it is a unique and special airbnb experience.

We are very grateful to have been able to have a unique and beautiful, relaxing experience on a budget. Thanks so much Kristen!!"
9988,185,This tent is a fantastic place to break away from the distractions of life. It has all the comforts you need for camping without truly roughing it outdoors. Kristen is a great hostess that will help show you the setup for the tent and answer any questions you may have.
9989,185,"This was a dream come true stay. It was close to where I needed to be, I felt very safe and secure in the neighborhood (even in a tent haha), and Kristen was awesome with communicating, she went above and beyond to make sure I had a good stay."
9990,186,"Such a great place to stay! My kids and I really enjoyed this cabin. The hot tub jets are powerful and relaxing. The main living room area is spacious and attractive. Loved sitting on the back deck, sipping coffee and looking at the green countryside.

Places nearby that saw us through:
Angry Troll Brewing - good food and brews only a 13-minute drive.
Dollar General - 12-minute drive for anything you might need.
Carter Waterfalls - a 20-minute drive. Park and a 5-minute easy hike in there are beautiful waterfalls."
9991,186,"This cabin is just as described - the deck view is beautiful and there are literally a million stars to see as you relax in the hot tub! Sawyer and his family were so friendly and accommodating. Shopping, walking and eating in Elkin was a short drive away. The cabin is set up in such a cool way and we had so much fun with checkers and foosball. Highly recommend and we would definitely stay here again!"
9992,186,"This cabin is great, like the dream home away from home. It’s beautiful and has everything you need."
9993,186,"I would recommend everyone to stay here. Great host, and beautiful cabin."
9994,186,"This whole stay was so incredible. The cabin was clean and gorgeous, the views are beautiful. It was relaxing. They have literally thought of every detail to make your stay comfortable. The sleep number bed was awesome! The hottub and the propane heater on the deck was a huge perk. Was so relaxing soaking and looking at the stars. The dogs, Lily and Leo made our whole stay feel like home. The kids fell in love with the dogs instantly. They actually asked to go back once a year and to stay longer. The creek you can walk to is beautiful. We really enjoyed walking and exploring. We would definitely love to come back and stay longer. Sawyer, and his Dad were so nice. Would recommend this cabin to anyone!"
9995,186,"This is one of the best Air BnBs I have ever stayed in. My fiends and I went to Elkin to do a winery tour and Sawyer's place was really convenient. The cabin is beautiful, everything was super clean, and the hot tub was relaxing. Sawyer was most helpful when we were hesitant to use the torch to light the fire. He came right over and lighted it for us. Sawyer and his mom and dad were very friendly and the pups were very cute. Will definitely stay there again and again!"
9996,186,"My girlfriend and I stayed here on our drive up from Florida to Pittsburgh. We loved the house and the hot tub was easily the nicest one we've used at an Airbnb. Highly recommend staying here. We drove about 15 minutes to get dinner at Southern on Main, highly recommend this restaurant. Excellent food, drinks and service."
9997,186,"This cabin was exactly what we were looking for. We were in the area for golf and a wine tour. This place was convenient for both. Cabin was super cute and clean. It had a really comfortable, homey feel and plenty of space for our group of four. We loved the hot tub and wood-burning fireplace. Used both every night of our stay. There is also a very nice outdoor firepit and seating area. We would definitely stay again when back in the area."
9998,186,Absolutely loved staying here. It provided the peaceful get away we were looking for. Hope to be back again for sure!
9999,186,"The furnishings in the cabin were comfortable. Everything was very clean. The hot tub on the deck outside the kitchen door was already 100 F, when we arrived & it was easy to adjust. The bubbling jets of hot water were just what we needed to relax after 6 hours of driving. I enjoyed the shrimp & grits from Southern on Main in Elkins, which is a few miles to the north of Sawyer’s home. I recommend this cabin for a family with school age children who respect stairs & balconies. I am happy to return to spend more time exploring nearby wineries."
10000,186,"Sawyer's cabin was even better than the pictures. It was cozy, clean and comfortable! There were many little touches (coffee, creamer, condiments, lotions, shampoo/conditioner) that made our stay even more enjoyable. We would love to visit this cabin again."
10001,186,"Another great weekend at my friend's cabin. We sure enjoyed our time with friends and visiting the wineries. Outdoor patio is a great addition to the cabin. Again, we will be back!"
10002,186,The view is amazing.
10003,186,We had a wonderful reconnecting weekend for Valentines' Day! No need to even leave the property!! Kitchen had everything we needed to eat all our meals there.
10004,186,Wonderful place to stay!
10005,186,"Not only was Sawyer such an amazing host with a fire ready for us when we arrived, but it was a gorgeous cabin. We could not have asked for better weather to look up at the stars from the hot tub. The inside was very unique with antiques and a beautiful setting. Sawyer gave us recommendations of where to eat, and we really were in the middle of NC’s wine country. Definitely in my top 3 and will be back!"
10006,186,If you find yourself in Ronda NC and in need of a place to stay or vacation you will not be disappointed Sawyer and his family have poured so much love and effort into this cabin. I was so glad to find their listing and had the pleasure to stay there. We would definitely recommend visiting and would love to come back and spend more time in the future.
10007,186,"Great weekend getaway! Sawyer offered to make us a fire for the night since we were going to check-in later and it was going to be cold. Great cabin and friendly family. We spoke with both Sawyer and Shawn as we were coming and going one day and felt like talking to long time friends. Nevertheless, we had all the privacy we wanted. Really great having 2 bath tubs and the hot tub, great for relaxing! We might bring the kids next time!"
10008,186,We really enjoyed our stay at Sawyer’s place! It was extremely nice to have a fire both inside and outside and we definitely took advantage of the time to use the hot tub as well. The very nice Bluetooth setup with the speakers right by the hot tub and fire pit is perfect and made those even more enjoyable! Lilly is a very friendly dog and we honestly loved having her around also. We would definitely book this trip again!
10009,186,"Great place to stay , better than the photos even , ten stars.. I think when a guest says that they would stay again says a lot about the place, and I definitely would.."
10010,186,"I booked this as a gift for my bf as a relaxing and peaceful getaway and it did not disappoint. The cabin feels like home, with the fireplace, amenities (hot tub, checkers, coffee bar), and comfy furniture. You have everything you need to feel relaxed, you almost don’t want to go anywhere during your stay. Sawyer and his dad take pride in this cabin and with good reason. It had been beautifully made, everything from Lily to the small details in the decorations and wood will leave you wanting to extend your stay."
10011,186,Sawyer was very friendly and helpful! The place was just what we were looking for and more. Already planning other opportunities to visit again only for longer.
10012,186,"Wow!!! This was an incredible Airbnb...loved having Sawyer as our Superhost and his dad. As fellow superhosts, it was great to experience another premier property. It was better than the photos, the Christmas decorations were a great touch, and the hot tub was to die for. In fact, we really wanted to book it again on our trip back from Pittsburgh to Georgia...however, it was already booked. Amazing host and place. Highly recommend!"
10013,186,Amazing cabin and property! Friendly hosts. Perfect for a quick stop for our family of 4
10014,186,It was an awesome trip to the cabin. Will be booking again in the future.
10015,186,"What a beautiful place. Definitely the most bang for my buck I've gotten at an Airbnb. And there's a hot tub! Enjoyed the Christmas decorations, it made the stay extra cozy."
10016,186,"Absolutely a hidden gem!!! We came up to the area for a weekend trip and if we could give this property 10 stars we would!! The cabin was absolutely beautiful decorated for the Christmas Holiday tree!! We couldn't believe all the little details that the cabin to make our trip as stress free as possible. The kitchen was perfect! The space was huge! The family definitely is the definition of super hosts!!!! We did this trip as a girls get away and it checked all the boxes of stress free, relaxing weekend. Shawn even checked on us to make sure we had everything we needed the evening we checked in- it was soo nice!! 5 star service all around. There was sooo much to do in a 30 mile radius and we loved it! We are going definitely going to book this property again!! Thanks Sawyer and Shawn for such a great weekend! We had a blast!"
10017,186,"Lovely cabin, and very helpful hosts! The cabin feels like home and is full of thoughtful touches!"
10018,186,Beautiful home! Sawyer and his dad were very friendly! Lilly the German Shepherd was very friendly! Will definitely stay again soon!
10019,186,Sawyer was very responsive to my questions prior to arriving and was available if we needed anything during our stay. The Cabin is a beautiful home with great family history! The hot tub was a bonus! We cannot wait to come back!
10020,186,Great time visiting wineries
10021,186,"I am going keep this short and sweet. EVERYTHING you read in all of the following reviews is 100 PERCENT TRUE!!! This place, from the second you walk in the door, feels like home. Sawyer doesn't miss a beat. Do yourself a favor and hit ""reserve"" right this second."
10022,186,"This is a very special place, and perhaps my best jewel discovered on AirBnB. My husband and I had a chance to reconnect and enjoy a gorgeous fall weekend stay here. We plan to return!"
10023,186,"Super nice cabin that is kept very clean. Everything you need is there(soap,shampoo, towels, kitchen supplies). Well furnished with games and other activities to keep you entertained. The upstairs bathroom has a wonderful tub for those who enjoy a bubble bath. Convenient location to multiple vineyards and areas to go hiking. We plan to stay here again!!"
10024,186,The cabin was amazing and had everything we needed! It was very cute and peaceful! We loved the dog and we will definitely be back!
10025,186,"The cabin is a wonderful place to stay! They have everything you need and they are wonderful hosts! If we are able to get back to this area again, we will definitely stay here again! It’s a beautiful place to stay!"
10026,186,Cabin is like going back in time but with luxury here and there also. Sawyer is friendly and willing to accomodate. Overall a great place to stay at a great price.
10027,186,My wife & I can’t say enough good things about our stay at Sawyer’s place. An absolutely wonderful cabin with every little detail taken care of. We will definitely be back!
10028,186,"This was a business stay. When I say we travel a lot and frequent Airbnb' s almost on a weekly basis, I'm not kidding!
Where do I begin... Let just say, if you keep scrolling by this place, you are truly going to miss out! From the moment we opened the door, we were blown away by the beauty and charm of this incredible cabin. I can not say enough about Sawyer, his family and the farm help, who all asked on multiple occasions if we needed anything! They treated us as family. We even made a new friend out of the farm dog, Lilly! Only negative is that we couldn't extend our stay. We will definitely be returning soon with our children so they can experience the old world charm of this hidden gem in Ronda, NC."
10029,186,"Very comfortable cabin!
Everything was just as described.
Location was perfect for our needs.
Sawyer and family provided all the info needed about the cabin and things to do in the area.
Lilly is a great welcoming party! ;-)
Will definitely stay again when we are back in this area!"
10030,186,When you walk in you instantly fell at home this a great place for a family getaway or just a couples getaway either way it's simply beautiful.
10031,186,"The cabin was everything we could’ve wanted for our weekend of exploring the local wineries.
Both Sawyer and his father Shawn were very accommodating and hospitable.
The cabin was fully stocked with everything that one would need with additional touches. The foosball table and checkers were a fun extra touch. I loved having my morning coffee on the front porch on the swing.
We will definitely be back in the future."
10032,186,Absolutely loved this cottage! If I’m back in NC definitely getting this cottage.
10033,186,The cabin was great! I was impressed with the updates and attention to detail. I wish we could have spent more time to enjoy everything it had to offer.
10034,186,A beautiful cabin on a lovely farm. We loved our overnight stay on our travel so much that our departure was delayed by 3 hours. Lovely cabin that has all of the amenities. Our only regret was that we had commitments so we had to leave. Very clean peaceful with quality furnishings and a two lovely decks to sit on.
10035,186,Great spot in the heart of Wine Country the Yadkin Valley! House is super cute and so spacious. The hosts were very friendly and made us feel at home! You wont want to leave!
10036,186,"Though it's true perfection can't be achieved in this world, I believe this cabin, and its owner/host is as close as you can get. This is a true ""hidden gem"" as they say; a place that you want to shout from the rooftops, while simultaneously hide away like a precious, invaluable secret to selfishly enjoy all to yourself. This is not an exaggeration, and I'm not related to, or endorsed by anyone connected to this wonderful place. My wife and I stayed here 2 nights, 3 days, but a single night in this cabin of dreams will be its own testimony to you. I don't have to make a convincing case for it, as it will easily do that for itself. As such, I will simply describe to you my experience. Walk with me through this journey.

Book yourself, it's not a gamble, but rather a guarantee that, if you're looking for an actual get-away, there are no other options. Ask about the history of the land, the family that owns it, and the cabin itself, and be immersed in the richness of self-bootstrap-pulling ingenuity and hand-built hard work, before you step foot into the wonderland that is the wide open vastness of the entry, living and dining rooms. No expense has been spared, and no detail has escaped the attention of the host with this cabin. You won't find another more thoughtfully accommodating host than Sawyer, and family. You will find yourself wanting to baby this cabin as if it was your own, while also wishing you had the means to secure a far longer stay in it.

The kitchen is full of detail and history, from the era-gone-by stove that weighs more than your car, to the pictures on the wall of the 1800s buildings that remain standing to this day, to the copper countertops that go so beautifully with the flow and form of natural wood. The back deck extends from the kitchen and grants you an awe-inspiring view of the evening sky, as the Southern heavens generate storms that bubble up, and pass by like a parade for your pure enjoyment. Slow down at the end of your day, and take in the awesome knowledge and might on display of the Creator, in the privacy and tranquility of the countryside on this deck. Simply breathtaking.

Once back inside, submerge yourself into either the claw-foot tub downstairs, or the beyond-belief depth of the upstairs Jacuzzi. Both choices result in unrivaled relaxation. Then, sink yourself into any of the furniture pieces that have no better attribute than absolute comfort, and accept the challenge; steel yourself for the truly difficult decision to use or not use the ample WiFi coverage for media consumption, up and against the temptation to do the opposite; literally nothing, and be quiet, and still. In either case, you won't be disappointed.

Taking a walk upstairs, you'll feel even more secure in your steps than on solid ground; not a sound from the wood occurs. You'll be greeted by a choice of three beds, all of which promise, and deliver, on a restful night's sleep for the next day's activities, or lack thereof. After you've awakened the next day, trust me when I say that you will find fewer temptations elsewhere in the world greater than that to never leave the cabin so as to accomplish anything, but rather gleefully accomplish nothing. It's, as they say, a ""no brainer"" - the cabin commands its presence to be acknowledged and appreciated, to which you will gladly, even endearingly oblige.

When your trip comes to its conclusion, and you've fought past the depression, at least enough, to actually pack your bags for your departure, you will find yourself exiting the front door, only to look back into the cabin, as you whisper your goodbye; your final parting, and promise to return, looking longingly, and reflecting on the unforgettable time you shared here, just like the last scene of Cheers. Forever will you remember this trip. Forever will you remember this place and its people. You will be changed. Yet, you're still not alone, as Lily, the farm dog, there for, and with you from the beginning (begging for someone to throw her ball), will escort and accompany you to your vehicle, as well as pant and wag you goodbye, just as she did when she excitingly welcomed you to her cabin.

Fellow Airbnbers, you won't find a better get-away, especially for my fellow introverts, but also for the extroverts who are looking for that still-necessary every now and again me-time. Do yourself the grand favor of experiencing this revitalizing dreamworld that is so neatly, cleanly, and lovingly packed inside the walls of this cabin. It reveals itself to your eyes like the pages of a book reveals itself to your mind. Prepare yourself for the involuntary, gasping, deep inhale of a lifetime upon crossing over its threshold, as the knowledge of the history of the workmanship that transcends even your best attempt to imagine a building otherwise, overwhelms and envelopes you.

This is no ordinary cabin. It has a history of hard-working men who, with their own hands, built multiple buildings and structures, over the course of generations, for them and their families. This is no ordinary host. An entire family's long-running history and rich, genuine, family-supporting, people-loving upbringing, resides in the heart of the man running this cabin. You won't find a better pairing, nor a better place to spend you, and/or your family's time. When you stay here, you become part of the family, and get to share a part of you with its history and heritage. Welcome to your new (temporary) home. Enjoy your stay."
10037,186,The stay was great nice quiet home feels very welcoming first step in
10038,186,"Fantastic, comfortable, great hosts, convenient location. Absolutely recommend and wouldn’t hesitate to return."
10039,186,This was a perfect mountain get away. The hosts were very responsive and it was spotless. Cozy cabin feel.
10040,186,"I am an AirBNB host and I stay at AirBNB’s frequently, and this is the greatest gem I have found. I joked that I didn’t want to write a review for this place because I wanted to keep it a secret…and then I saw that others here had already made the same comment.

This is a clean, beautiful, and beautifully appointed cabin on a sprawling farm. I let my 7yo and 5yo wander the farm unsupervised in the morning (they’re city kids) and didn’t have to worry about them at all. Sawyer and his family are so warm and welcoming…Sawyer’s dad heard we had kids and left a box of pancake mix for breakfast. They also LOVED picking tomatoes in the garden out back.

This is truly AirBNB at its best - not just a hotel alternative, but a way for people from different walks of life to connect in a meaningful way. Thank you for a wonderful stay, we will definitely be back!"
10041,186,"Amazing hosts, BEAUTIFUL cabin & farm and Lilly the farm dog was the sweetest! Planning on coming back again real soon!"
10042,186,"Sawyer’s cabin was cozy, cute and relaxing. We loved the open layout and the beautiful view. The kids had s great time with the games and enjoyed Lilly, the dog."
10043,186,What a Nice place!!!! Clean and a lot of Space
10044,186,"A very clean and open floor plan. It sits on about 1000 acre farm. The views are nice. They even encouraged us to pick some of their vegetables from the garden. Amply supplied kitchen. They have a front porch and a back deck. Feels like you were very much away from it all! If the skies are clear at night, be sure and go out and look up."
10045,186,"Great place, nice area, felt very homey, would definitely book again!"
10046,186,We really enjoyed our stay at this great cabin. Sawyer was an excellent host and his communication before and during our stay was some of the best we have encountered with any AirBnB rental. We also enjoyed our conversations with Shawn and he and Sawyer were always around to make sure our visit was enjoyable. And Lily the family dog was a treat to have around when she came to visit. One great treat we didn't expect was being able to pick some fresh corn (outstanding) and tomatoes from the family garden. Best corn we have ever eaten! We highly recommend this great cabin!
10047,186,The cabin was nice inside and out . Great location .
10048,186,This is a gem. Beautiful cabin with all of the amenities. I would definitely recommend this stay if you’re in the area. The hosts were fantastic and communication was excellent throughout.
10049,186,We loved this cabin! So beautiful and clean and peaceful. Sawyer and his family were such amazing hosts. We came to town to visit one of the local vineyards and this location was so convenient. All the country charm for a quaint getaway!
10050,186,"We had an amazing stay, absolutely beautiful and so relaxing."
10051,186,Perfectly designed log cabin- delightful-
10052,186,"This beautiful cabin is truly the best kept secret in Wilkes County (NC Wine Country)!
Shhhhhh! Don’t tell anyone."
10053,186,"Magical! I told Sawyer I didn’t want to write a review for him because we want to keep this place all to ourselves! I can’t recommend this cabin enough!
The entire place is beautiful, rustic, and peaceful. It is very well equipped, comfy beds/furniture, clean and welcoming! The family is great! We will definitely be back…again and again!!"
10054,186,"We loved this unique, family friendly, comfortable cabin. The check in process was so easy. The kitchen is well equipped and looks out on the beautiful farmland. The bathrooms were so luxurious and the large covered front porch is a great place to relax in a rocker or swing. My 4 year old grandson enjoyed “winning “ every game of checkers, football and Uno in the great rec area. Our only regret was not having time to stay longer! Sawyer kept us well informed and talking with Shaun and Sally was like visiting friends. We hope to return for a longer stay!"
10055,186,We absolutely loved staying at this cabin! There is everything you need and the quality is impeccable. We all slept soundly in the super comfortable beds and I really relaxed in the antique bathtub. Everything was very clean and well maintained. We can't wait to stay there again!
10056,187,Absolutely great place to call home for a few days. Tammy and Mick poured so much care into this lovely one-bedroom suite. They really thought about what their guests would need and what we might forget. We liked the pineapple theme and the colors were bright and happy. Our children went crazy for the mini-waffle iron. And the child who never cooks at home became the official waffle chef for our stay. Very nice holiday for us. And the sunrise was definitely worth walking up to see! We will be back!
10057,187,"Positives: clean, well-stocked, beautiful decor, special touches, clear directions, amazing waterfront view.

Things to consider: if you are allergic or sensitive to cigarette smoke, this is not the place for you. There are no restaurants or things to do nearby, the place is next to two old trailers, you can't control the temperature (controls are not in the room)."
10058,187,Tammy’s place was a great place to stay at! Very cozy and welcoming we loved the little details she had in there. I would recommend her place to anyone!
10059,187,Great stay! Very welcoming place. Helped ourselves to the little waffle making station provided at breakfast while watching the sunrise right out of the window!
10060,187,Wonderful place!
10061,187,"Overall fantastic. Spectacular accommodations, beautiful views, Excellent communication throughout our whole Stay. If you are looking for a relaxing and trinkle vacation away from everything, Then this is the place for you. The best part of this experience was the lake. I would definitely recommend this location, and would love to stay here again."
10062,187,Absolutely lovely place. All the decorations really made place special. Loved the coffee and breakfast supplies. Goodies too. Fruit tray was wonderful too. Best grapes ever. Need to figure out what kinds they were.
10063,187,"This place blew us away! Right on the water, and a big yard for our dog to play. Tammy left little personal touches like notes welcoming me and my boyfriend and dog, she left a basket of dog stuff for Rocco, she cooked pineapple upside down cakes (that were absolutely delicious), two white waffle robes outside the shower, I could go on and on! This place was so homey. The view of the sunrise from the bedroom wasn’t bad either 😊☀️ 100% recommend."
10064,187,The 🍍 Suite was a great stay for the weekend. It is beautifully decorated and the view of the island is amazing to wake up to every morning. Tammy was an awesome host and I can not wait to plan another trip in the summer!
10065,187,Fantastic stay!
10066,187,Tammy was a really good host. When there was a problem with the water she was on top of it without any issues. She was helpful with what to do.
10067,187,"Pineapple Suite was a perfect spot for us to stay for the evening after spending time in the Outer Banks. Tammy’s spot is pretty rural, but that makes the views of the ocean spectacular! The apartment is comfortable and well stocked for all you could need during a stay. The waffles were a fun addition! Thank you for your quick and easy check in and check out!"
10068,187,"This is a fantastic place - the view, the location, but especially all the little details and thought that is put into the place. The pineapple theme was charming. The waffle maker and snacks was an unexpected delight. Even the instructions for the TV were very helpful. This is an excellent place and highly recommended!"
10069,187,"Wonderful stay at the Pineapple Suite! Thank you so much for hosting us. We didn’t plan our visit out well enough but definitely made the best of the trip. Spent the day Saturday going over to Cape Lookout on the ferry. It was fantastic! Also stopped by the decoy museum, totally worth the visit before boarding the ferry on Harkers Island if you choose to go to Cape lookout. It’s definitely a perfect day trip. Next time we would like to get off on Shackleford banks island to see the wild ponies because we totally had enough time to do both islands just didn’t realize we would."
10070,187,"What a lovely spot! Exceeded expectations. Only needed a place to crash for the night but appreciated all the little details added for guests, and of course the beautiful water view!"
10071,187,Excellent cozy quiet place!!!
10072,187,Mick and Tammy are by far the best hosts you could ask for. Everything was great during our stay and they will go out of their way to make sure that you have a great stay. This was our second trip here and we plan to keep going.
10073,187,The pineapple suite is a wonderful get away. Tammy and Mick thought of everything to make our stay as relaxing as possible. A++. We hope to make it back!
10074,187,"The Pineapple Suite did not disappoint and Mick and Tammy were superb hosts! We were looking for a remote place with a beautiful view on the water, and that's exactly what we found. Check-in was super easy, and upon arriving we were welcomed with a sweet Happy 30th Anniversary note from Tammy, a couple of Andes mints, freshly cut fruit in the fridge, and treats for our dog. The suite is decorated so perfectly and well stocked in all areas. It was just like we had our own little apartment on the coast for a little while! The views are amazing especially as the sun rises over the water. While you're there, the Cedar Island Beach access is perfect for enjoying the water and Cedar Island Stables is right there to ride horses on the beach! We hope to come back in the future!"
10075,187,"Great, quiet place. The apartment is very well equipped. Directly on the beach, just 15 minutes to ferry. We will come again and stay longer."
10076,187,"Tammy's and Nick's getaway was all we needed, somewhere that you can see the night sky away from noise and city lights. We instantly felt great once we got into the suite due to the awesome taste of decoration and proper use of spaces. The lawn was mowed, clean towels and cutlery all in their places, and lively notes and little gifts for us here and their. We enjoyed our stay and recommend this lovely package to people who are after tranquility and relaxation."
10077,187,"What a cute and homey enviorment!!!! Im new to using Airbnbs so i saw the price and was like ouch.... but it is 100% and then some more worth the price!!!! The location is beautiful right on the water but unfortunately no beach. The house was fully furnished with all the essentials!!! She has a futon in the main area which is actually pretty comfy for sleeping!! blankets, pillows, dishware you name it shes got it!!! My friend and I felt like we were at an apartment!!! Beautiful stay would HIGHLY recommend."
10078,187,"Tammy and Mick were fantastic hosts. They had a sweet note and fruit plate awaiting us upon our arrival. The pineapple suite was adorable, exceptionally clean and tastefully decorated. We felt very at home in the suite and had a great vacation!"
10079,187,Such wonderful personal touches to make you feel at home and all the comforts you might need. What a wonderful host!!
10080,187,Very accommodating hosts! Thoughtful and nice personal touches in the suite! Will definitely book again!
10081,187,"The Pineapple Suite is a MUST stay! All of the essentials are provided and the space is perfect for a getaway. The view from the suite is absolutely incredible and Cedar Island Beach did not disappoint (they also left plenty of towels which was a lifesaver). Mick and Tammy are amazing hosts and do absolutely everything they can to accommodate their guests. Oh, and they even left a basket of goodies for our pups 🥹."
10082,187,"Fantastic stay, one of our fave AirBnBs. We visited during a period of good weather in July. The accommodation was a great, cozy fit for our family of four (two young teen boys) thanks to the single sleeper bed and futon bed in the living room, and has breathtaking views of the Pamlico sound. It was very clean and well stocked, and had absolutely gorgeous views and felt bright and calm. The host family were friendly, informative and hospitable, more so than most other AirBnB hosts, and respected our privacy. All the nice things mentioned in other reviews were the same for our stay!

We brought a kayak and paddled it out front of the property to the Pamlico Sound, which is knee high depth for around 100m off shore (just enough to get away from the mosquitoes). Access to the water was via a ladder over an eight foot (approx) wall drop, there is a quiet boat ramp about a mile away, as well as another at the lovely and uncrowded Cedar Island beach proper, about 10 minutes drive away. We saw crabs, small fish and a ray in front of the property.

As a general location Cedar Island is not a bustling touristy place compared to others on the Outer Banks, and is probably more off beaten track: we thoroughly enjoyed the more relaxed feel. However, it does have some cool activities such as horse riding on the dunes (and when the tide allows, on the water- book ahead!) and is a gateway via ferry to the highly acclaimed Ocracoke Island on the Outer Banks.

Much of the surrounding area is marsh or has other standing water, so has a lot of biting mosquitoes .. bring bug spray! They will make your acquaintance once you get out the car if you arrive in the evening as we did:)

Five stars! We hope to be back."
10083,187,"Wonderful updated duplex. Owners live next door if anything is needed, but you would never know they were there. Very clean and well decorated. Sunrises are absolutely beautiful on the waterway. Very private and serene location,p just a few miles from Cedar Beach and ferry. I would definitely stay here again."
10084,187,The Pineapple Suite is inviting and relaxing. Tammy & Mick do a great job in making guests feel welcomed! The suite is as it appears in pictures.
10085,187,"Just a great place, everything is well maintained and so cozy. You really feel like you are at a retreat."
10086,187,The Pineapple suite was just what we needed. Has a beach vibe and was so comfortable and clean. Our dog loved the dog bed that Tammy provided too. We enjoyed being close by the ferry and Cedar Island beach. The location is beautiful right on the water.
10087,187,"The Pineapple Suite exceeded my expectations on all levels. Tammy thoughtfully included a wide variety of details to make sure our stay was superb. The kitchen was well stocked, the bed was heavenly and the level of cleanliness was top notch. The location on Cedar Island is beautifully serene. If you're looking to step out of your hectic world for a few days, this would be a perfect location."
10088,187,"Mick & Tam were superb hosts. They made us feel welcomed as soon as we arrived. Their hospitality & little added touches were unmatched. All the extras: fresh cut up fruit, Andes mints, dog bed w/treats, waffle makings, fishing advice/tips & talks.
Loved The cabinet in the bathroom with all the “in case you forgot(s)”
I clean Airbnbs myself & cleanliness is a huge deal to me & Tam absolutely blew me away! Super impressed all the way around & would definitely be back!! <3"
10089,187,Beautiful spot and a lovely apartment. Highly recommended.
10090,187,"Wonderful hosts! The suite was absolutely adorable, clean, and spacious. The duplex was out of town a good ways and the closest thing for groceries is a Dollar General, but our beach vacation was fantastic and we didn’t have to worry about the hustle and bustle of the normal “big city” beaches. We definitely will be returning!"
10091,187,Incredibly clean and quiet location.
10092,187,"The islanders wave like your a neighbor, super friendly people. The beach is not far, the sand is white and a tone of sand bars. There is friendly cows and horses in view of the beach. We meant the island dog, Jamie, he was our favorite part of the trip. The stay was extremely thought out. breakfest, a fruit charcuterie board, little notes with the wifi password and other informational instructions. It was giving home and pinterest. Everything was perfect. I would highly recommend!"
10093,187,Whats more to say? The hosts are great. House was clean. Beach was close. Our family had a very relaxing time while we were here. The hosts are very chill and thoughtfull. Best part of the trip for me was the fruit we had all cut up on the first night waiting for us. Thanks again guys. Book with confidence!
10094,187,Such a tidy little place. Quiet and peaceful
10095,187,"We had a wonderful time during our week-long stay with Mick and Tammy. They couldn't have been better hosts. The apartment was clean, quiet, and had a magnificent view of the cedar island bay. Our hosts treated us to soft shell crab, an evening cruise on the bay, and warm burritos after being stranded for the evening in ocracoke due to a ferry issue. Highly recommend the host and the apartment."
10096,187,This place was perfect! Cleanliness is import to me and it was superb! Great kindness and the personal touches in the house made it even better! Highly recommend staying here!
10097,187,"Even though we only had a one night stay, everything was beyond anything we would’ve expected! We were privileged to meet Tammy and her husband! Their hospitality was beyond wonderful! We’ll be back without a doubt. Hidden gem, no doubt! 💕"
10098,187,The accommodations were exactly as described. Many sweet touches such as welcome fruit and waffle makings for the morning. I would definitely stay here again.
10099,187,"We felt welcome from the time we pulled up. Mick and Tammy was very polite and friendly. We loved the “extra” personal touches. The place was lovely. If you are looking for a quiet getaway, I recommend staying here."
10100,187,If you are looking for a quiet place with a beautiful view this is you spot. Tammy and her husband did an amazing job making sure we had everything we needed for our stay including things to do in town. The people in the town are helpful and super nice also.
10101,187,"From the welcoming plate of fruit in the fridge on arrival to the end of our too short stay, the Pineapple Suite was perfect. We especially loved the quiet and the views over the water.
So many thoughtful touches provided for a traveller who is not carrying the basics to throw a meal together, like spices, oil and vinegar, coffee, and a fully equipped kitchen with bonuses (which I’m not going to reveal- much more fun to discover yourself)
Only regret- not having a couple more days there."
10102,187,"A beautiful retreat with unbelievably thoughtful amenities! We fell in love with the space and the waterfront location, and wish we could have stayed longer. Highly recommend!"
10103,187,Wonderful place to stay and enjoy the beautifully decorated home and area!
10104,187,"You search for a quite, private and lovely space ? This is the perfect match for you. Close to Cedar Island Beaches where you can enjoy Caribbean flair. The Pineapple Suite was created with much love and passion to every detail. You can feel and see the passion to pineapples. We enjoyed the welcome gift which was placed in the fridge and made our sit together even better! Thanks for having us."
10105,187,The view from the suite is beautiful. A good place to stay during vacation at outer banks. The entire suit has cozy vibes and all the necessary things are there to make the stay more comfortable.
10106,187,"We absolutely loved our
stay! The view is
spectacular, the hosts
extremely friendly, and
accommodations lovely.
The bed was heavenly!!!
We also appreciated the
extra touch of pineapple
and orange slices!"
10107,187,"This was a wonderful place to stay, and I just wish we would have been able to stay longer! The Pineapple Suite was extremely clean and homey, with beautiful decor! The hosts thought of everything to make our stay perfect! Looking back at our 22-day road-trip, this was by far the best place that we stayed! Thank you, Tammy & Mick!"
10108,187,"This place is awesome! Don’t hesitate to book right away, no I didn’t get paid to write this 😆 but we had such an excellent time! Great relaxing space, unbelievable view. Thoughtful touches everywhere. If you like peace and quiet it’s hard to beat. The hosts were great!"
10109,187,Excellent home and location. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Tammy and Mic are very kind and accommodating hosts!
10110,187,Beautiful location. The place was clean and comfortable and fully stocked.
10111,187,"The Pineapple Suite exceeded my expectations. It was beautifully decorated, clean, and comfortable. Tammy was a gracious host and went above with the small touches. The area is beautiful and so relaxing."
10112,187,"We love it. So clean, easy access, easy check in, easy check out and a beautiful view. I hope we can come back one day"
10113,187,"If you want a quiet, relaxing place to stay, away from it all, this is the place. Close enough to the ferry to Ocracoke to make an easy day trip (reserve your ferry tickets in advance). But come prepared with food and essentials for your stay because depending on the season, the nearest restaurants or convenience could be up to an hour drive both ways. Plenty of places nearby though for outdoor adventuring, or just stay in and enjoy the lovely view of the sound."
10114,187,I had a great time it was just what I needed everything needed was there. all you needed to bring was myself and food this is the perfect place if you would like to have a private time and be able to fish both of the host were great I will be going again IT is about a 45 minuet drive to the grocery store so bring what you might need the drive is a great drive though I was about 5 minuets away from the ferry to that was a plus Tammy and her husband were great you never no they are even there and when you do they are so polite and ready to help when ever you need them . I look forward to stay with them again in the future . Again thank you
10115,187,"A beautiful spot near the Cedar Island ferry to Ocracoke. The hosts really go above and beyond, stocking snacks, treats, coffee pods, toiletries, and everything else you might need for a stay. They were also very quick to respond when we reached out with questions. Great stay!"
10116,187,All of the positive reviews are posted accurate.
10117,187,Everything was very clean and decorated nicely! Gorgeous view! We thoroughly enjoyed it!!! Highly recommend!
10118,187,"This was a beautiful place, so well decorated and comfortable. Full kitchen with a dishwasher, all the utensils, dinnerware, and cookware you'd need.

Tammy has set up a gorgeous suite with many thoughtful amenities and generous treats. We especially appreciated the accommodations for our pup -- the most comfortable bed just for pets that he didn't want to get out of, dog snacks, clean stainless steel bowls.

Views of the water are magnificent and seeing the starry night from the porch was really special.

We'd love to stay again for longer."
10119,187,"Absolutely lovely! We went for a stay away from busy city life and found breathtaking ocean views and a breath of fresh sea air. The room was beautiful and super clean. I have yet to stay in a nicer suite. I'd prefer to come back here than to stay at a hotel. While a winter visit to the beach was met with chilly winds and a lot of nearby shops being closed for the season, it provided the solitude we needed!"
10120,187,"Tammy and her husband are amazing! They are so kind, considerate and super helpful. Everything looked as the pictures and better actually! They put a lot of thought into the suite and I have nothing but good mentions about them and the location. They literally thought of everything, and stuff you may have not thought of, they did. If you want to get a peaceful time, away from the city, or just come to look at the stars, this is the place. My daughter and I sat by the fire pit watching the stars come out and fill the sky, we literally kept looking up for 2 or 3 hours. Then we went over to the beach end of the island later on to see the stars completely fill that sky over the water. It’s brilliant and that was her first time seeing a sky full of stars.
Btw, you can ride horses on this beach but I learned you can’t book same day so book ahead.

Thank you to the hosts, we appreciated the hospitality! You are wonderful! Cheers!
Katarzyna"
10121,187,Enjoyed our stay very much. House was clean and comfortable. View over the water stunning.
10122,187,"Tammy’s place is perfect! Clean, decorated beautifully, and just the right size for a couple! Check-in and check out was so easy. Communication was timely. She had thought of such nice little things such as a note left to wish my husband a happy birthday, a few snacks, and best of all great directions on how to operate the tv remote! I love that as the remotes can be so different! The view is incredible! You can see the water from the entire place! The deck was so nice! We would definitely recommend Tammy’s place! We are planning on visiting again!"
10123,187,Well configured
10124,187,Great stay. Everything was furnished and was very comfortable. The host was very responsive to messages about check in and the place was very clean.
10125,187,"Tammy and Mick were fantastic hosts and have created a charming place to stay. Beautifully decorated, extremely clean and very comfortable. Clear views of the water, the stunning sunrise and the stars at night."
10126,187,The Pineapple Suite was fantastic. The location was beautiful and the suite itself had everything we needed. It was the perfect spot for a weekend getaway with my husband. And Tammy was a wonderful host. I highly recommend this property if you’re looking for a quiet retreat right on the water.
10127,187,"Tammy and Mick have a beautiful place in a remote part of Cedar Island, very close to the wildlife refuge. Incredible to wake up right on the water. The suite is extremely thoughtfully equipped and super comfortable. The hosts were very communicative and I would have stayed longer if I had the time."
10128,187,"I can’t tell you how cozy the space is, how beautiful the water view is, how stocked the bathroom & kitchen are, or how easy the check-in and out are. Just go now! This was my family’s first OBX trip and Cedar Island was our haven to start the trip. The ferry to Ocracoke Island is about 5 minutes down the road. We have already decided after leaving and spending our next nights in Kitty Hawk, NC that we FAR prefer the isolation of Cedar Island. The place is right on a peaceful sound and you’ll awake to the sunrise over the water from your bedroom. Our 11 y/o loved the futon, Uno game, and mystery stories book! Hot cocoa & tea along with a Keirug for coffee. Plenty of towels, thick waffle bathrobes. What else? Just go. You won’t regret it if you’re looking for peace & quiet & the easy convenience of the ferry. This Air Bnb also backs up to a wildlife refuge nearby."
10129,187,"The pineapple suite is probably the most well appointed AirBNB I've stayed in. Every detail was considered to make our stay comfortable - robes, coffee, a sweet note welcoming us, a doggy bed for our pups with treats and toys - the list goes on and on. Tammy was very responsive and helpful leading up to our stay, and the place does not disappoint. If you're travelling to Cedar Island for some peace and quiet with a beautiful view of the stars and sky - look no further, this is the place!"
10130,187,"great place to stay,"
10131,187,"This was an awesome host and place to stay on our visit to Ocracoke Island and the Outer Banks
Could not be any better ❤️"
10132,187,"Amazing stay. Hosts thought about pretty much everything; it’s clean and well furnished, super cozy, and right on the water. Absolutely beautiful. Can’t wait to book a far longer stay here so we can really enjoy everything on the island!"
10133,187,Very cute and clean. Loved the doggy bed and goodies provided for my pup.
10134,187,This was a lovely Airbnb in a cool off-the-beaten path destination. I'd highly recommend it.
10135,187,"Adorable suite with everything clean and in order. The little touches such as the doggy basket for my dog, the stocked medicine cabinet and the fruit platter to welcome me for my stay were greatly appreciated and not overlooked. The location is fairly remote which is just what I was looking for but only minutes away from the ferry to ocracoke. I have never seen a more beautiful sunset and moonrise than I saw while I was there. I will definitely be back and recommend to all my friends."
10136,187,"What you see in the photos can be believed. The Pineapple Suite is completely comfortable, well-stocked with a view that can't be beat! Mick and Tammy are so friendly and I felt at ease with their hospitality. Go and visit as soon as you can!"
10137,187,"What a beautifully appointed place, everything you could ever need or want for a relaxing vacation. It’s a beautiful quiet retreat in a great location. Hope to be back to stay again next year!"
10138,187,"Don't hesitate to book a stay here-- the setting is wonderful, the apartment is lovely, and spotless. Hosts were helpful if we needed anything."
10139,187,"Great little cozy spot to park yourself and go explore. Right on the water the sunrise was amazing. The night sky was equally amazing. I have never seen the stars and milky way so clear in my life! The suite is super adorably decorated. It's clean and well maintained. Little things like the medicine cabinet of things you might need (like if you forgot toothpaste, etc) the towel bathrobes, the sheets were sooooo soft, little snacks and water. Just a good quality stay. Hosts are super sweet and friendly. Thanks so much! 👌🏻"
10140,189,"My husband & I took a few days to enjoy fishing on Jordan Lake. Not only was the cabin very close to a public boat ramp, but it was also a great place for a couple to get away. Plenty of room to park a bass boat & pick up. Electricity was very convenient to charge a boat overnight. We had no concerns of theft and felt right at home in the area. Cabin was very comfortable and cozy. Will definitely return. A couple things to note: Refrigerator is college size, so limited storage for food and it has no freezer."
10141,189,"The cabin has been beautifully renovated. The downstairs is very restful, and the bedroom upstairs is quite spacious, with a very comfortable bed! We didn't get a chance to use the sauna, but we look forward to when we return!"
10142,189,"This is an amazing cabin. Spotless. Very private and secluded. My wife and I just love this place, and will definitely be back. This was truly a rare find. No hyperbole.

You feel like you are a million miles from no where, yet you are minutes from some very fine dining in Pittsboro. I cannot say enough about this elegantly rustic cabin."
10143,189,"Great spot to get away and sweat in a barrel sauna! Super Comfy bed, not too far from Raleigh and lots of hiking."
10144,189,We enjoyed being close to the lake. We missed having a freezer.
10145,189,I travel for work & regularly stay at Airbnbs. This is one of my all-time favorite places to stay. It is cozy and adorable. The towels are luxurious & the bed is ridiculously comfortable. I had the pleasure of staying there a couple of nights when it was raining & the sound of it on the tin roof was so soothing. This is a lovely log cabin for a nice getaway.
10146,189,Incredible stay at an incredible home
10147,189,"The cabin exceeded our expectations! It was cozy and adorable, plus it had so much character. it was just what we needed for a relaxing weekend away from home with the pups. In addition, when I asked the host for hiking/trail recommendations, she responded within minutes with several suggestions amd detailed resources and directions. It was all perfect, and we'd love to come back again!"
10148,189,What a peaceful place that you can enjoy both outside and inside. Outside is a great fire pit (bring your own wood or purchase at mart about five minutes away) and a barrel dry sauna that works just great. You are in the woods with open space around you and at night there isn’t much light pollution so the night sky is great. Inside is very comfortable. Very well designed and constructed cabin with all the basic comforts and very functional HVAC. The kitchen has the basic necessities (bring what you need) and very easy to use. The bathroom is downstairs and very nice and fits in with the country motif. The bedroom is upstairs up a winding circular staircase and the bed and linens are so comfortable. Plenty of windows to enjoy the surroundings. No noise except the occasional wild beast in the woods. Great porches and well lit both outside and inside. What a great place and stay!
10149,189,This cabin was very peaceful and relaxing for a get away! Exactly like the pictures listed. Host was quick to respond and was easy to work with as we had some unforeseen things come up! Would love to revisit this cabin for a get away! The perfect little stay!
10150,189,"Absolutely perfect week in this beautiful home. Peaceful, serene and relaxing. The bed is very comfortable!!!"
10151,189,"The place is as advertised! Great stay and very comforting and very much a relaxing getaway!

Only issue we had is that if you have large dogs, going up the spiril staircase may be a problem for them.

Would book this place again!"
10152,189,Delightful cabin in a peaceful setting. It was the perfect place to recharge for a few days.
10153,189,Location is close to Jordan lake and cabin is nestled into a quiet area providing privacy and relaxation in a cozy cabin.
10154,189,"First of all, this place is a unique gem.

1) Absolutey gorgeous. It's even better in person! Absolutey gorgeous from inside and out.

2) This was a perfect place to go hiking/kayaking. The nature was abundant and at night, we could see each and every star!

3) The interior is so cozy and gorgeous! I've never seen such a unique cabin in my life and believe me, I searched a lot!

4) Our hosts were amazing. Responsive. Friendly. And caring down to each and every detail.

5) Attention to detail was surprisingly abundant! Whether it was supplying everything we could need (i.e paper towels) to decor (i.e the gorgeous Appalachian trail walking canes), the little details were well thought out.

Overall 5/5 experience.
Not a single complaint.
We came from Canada and we will back!"
10155,189,Very cute cabin. Would stay again.
10156,189,"We loved our staycation. Despite our stay overlapping with a tropical storm (whoops) we stayed safe, cozy, and dry. Our hosts even made sure we had bottled water and flashlights just in case! During the less torrential portions of rain the rocking chairs on the tin roofed porch were a relaxing way to enjoy the fall rain before the winds picked up again.

The cabin is thoughtfully designed, incredibly comfortable, and the perfect little getaway spot! It’s also pretty close to downtown Pitsboro for a dinner out at one of the cute restaurants or breweries."
10157,189,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this cozy cabin. It was a peaceful setting with relaxing views and a very comfortable living area and loft bed. The location is perfect for a variety of hikes at the nearby Jordan Lake Dam.
10158,189,An absolutely lovely little caben perfectly located by Jordan lake! We loved our stay here
10159,189,Lovely place!!
10160,189,"I was looking for a quiet retreat space and this place fit the bill. It was very sweet and the outdoor shower was fantastic. There was a small glitch with check-in but the hosts were very responsive. The steps up to the loft were a bit tricky, so I wouldn't recommend to anyone with mobility issues."
10161,189,Sweet cabin with sauna. Enjoyed the stay. Great spot.
10162,189,"This is a gorgeous cabin with rustic touches & an incredibly comfortable bed! I stayed here alone but it would be perfect for an anniversary or couples get away.

The front porch is lovely and I enjoyed my coffee out there each morning and tea each evening watching the sun set.

The kitchen has the basics, I brought my own groceries and had everything I needed for all my meals.

A note to anyone with mobility or vision issues- this is not the cabin for you! The staircase to the bedroom is very unique and beautiful but was a challenge to navigate, especially if you need to pee in the middle of the night!

The host was very communicative about rule & expectations, and provided everything I needed for my stay."
10163,189,We had a great time at the cabin! Everything was very well thought out and they had everything you needed for a realizing and enjoyable time. We especially enjoyed the sauna and very comfortable bed. I'd recommend this place to anyone considering staying here!
10164,189,An absolutely beautiful and cozy cabin. Everything from the decorations to comfort was top notch. I had a question about the sauna and they were very quick to respond. The price point may be a little high though.
10165,189,"BEAUTIFUL. COMFORTABLE. The bed was probably one of the most comfortable air b n Bs I’ve ever been in. The bathroom is downstairs but this cabin is gorgeous, cozy and beautifully re done. We will for sure be back! It’s Across the way from the Jordan Lake- and I’m telling make them the time to go on a pontoon with Jordan Lake Journeys for a few hours to hear the history of the lake…. The cabin is 25 min from Raleigh and all the things to do. Which was perfect for us! The Carolina Tiger Rescue is a short 13 min away and also well worth the money snd drive! We will be back to Jordan lake! ❤️"
10166,192,"The cabin was everything! It was so peaceful and relaxing. It was not cold enough during our stay to utilize the wood heater, but I know that would have been awesome as well. Internet is definitely sketchy, and there is virtually no cell service, so if you want to have a great excuse not to answer your phone, stay here! Just a side note: I read some reviews that complained about the neighbors dogs barking constantly. We stayed three nights, and those dogs barked twice while we were there, and that was only as we were unloading! They did not bother us at all! I did contact the owners a couple of times with some questions. They answered quickly and efficiently. Thanks for a wonderful place to stay. The Tafts."
10167,192,"Beautiful cabin in peaceful and quiet surroundings. Loved the loft bedroom and porch. The hosts were very friendly, and the whole process went very smoothly."
10168,192,"We had a wonderful stay at Craig and Anna’s cabin. The stream out front provided a constant, soothing sound. The cabin was clean, the bed very comfortable and the front porch was perfect for kicking back after a day of hiking in the park. It was great spending a couple of relaxing days at this comfy cabin."
10169,192,This place is exactly as described. This home is very peaceful and a great place to relax and be away from all the noise and still be in a very lovely home with all modern amenities. The bed was very comfortable. It is near a lot of great small towns with great shopping and restaurants for all types of tastes. It is an hour from Ashville and Gatlinburg on a very scenic road. Craig and Anna were very easy to work with. It's definitely a great place to stay.
10170,192,The surrounding creeks and waterfalls were the icing on the cake! Nicely decorated and warming stay! We had everything we needed to feel at home
10171,192,"I loved the spot. I gave 4 out of 5 for a few small things that could have been described a bit better. Internet is available but its sketchy at best. Streaming tv is not really possible. My lady is a city girl and was not able to manage life without internet. Cabin has wood stove, just be prepared to stoke through the night during cold months. Otherwise It was amazing, the creek out front sounded wonderful. Life begins where the black top ends. within 20 minutes of everything. Perfect spot for quiet solitude or reconnection."
10172,192,"The cabin is just as described. We loved that you could open the door and listen to the creek… and there was wood piled up for the wood burning stove. Fully stocked kitchen items made cooking easy. Recommendations from the hosts and prior guests provided lots of ideas of things to do. There’s no service without the wifi, so they also have a house phone in case you need to make a call. My husband and I wanted a place to go and relax, it was the perfect place!
(We took a quick drive to Bryson City for a lovely hike, over to Cherokee where we saw elk and along the blue ridge parkway!)"
10173,192,Perfect place to get away from all the noise.
10174,192,"Really enjoyed my stay!! The location was perfect, very peaceful! The home was neat and clean!"
10175,192,This little hidden gem was an amazing romantic get away. We ebjoyed how warm and welcoming the cabin was and will be returning!
10176,192,We loved the cabin.
10177,192,"Great spot, my wife and I had an amazing time!"
10178,192,Fantastic experience! Great hosts and great cabin. Within an hour of a lot of fun places and great hikes!
10179,192,Very easy and peaceful stay! Checked in late on the night of arrival and everything was ready to go when we got there. Very clean and had everything we needed.
10180,192,My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Craig and Anna's cabin. Its comfortable and cozy and the woodstove was amazing during the cool days and nights. To have the creek just outside the home and to hear it while we slept with the window opened was wonderful. Its close to so many good hiking and driving spots in the heart of the appalachian mountains as well! Thank you very much for the wonderful stay!
10181,192,"This place is so amazing. The picture does not do it justice. It looks wonderful and beautiful on the inside and out. This place is so breathtaking. Peace quiet relaxing the sound of the water running in the creek, relaxes you. You feel close to heaven.
We will be back"
10182,192,We had a lovely stay in this cute little cabin. Absolutely perfect location close to a lot of things but still felt secluded. Only a few minutes from town and many good restaurants. The cast iron stove is great. The property is very pretty. Enjoyed the nespresso machine. Just don’t expect the Wi-Fi to work. It was very slow at best and sometimes non existent. The little tv does have a dvd player though. I would come back just for the location and peacefulness here.
10183,192,"We had a wonderful weekend getaway to Craig and Anna’s cabin. Everything was as described. Loved sitting on the porch listening to the creek. Even with rainy weather it was such a relaxing time. The cabin is just a short drive from Cherokee, Bryson City, and Sylva. All three cities had fun things to do. Would definitely recommend staying there."
10184,192,"This cabin is absolutely perfect! This was our second time booking Anna and Craig’s cabin and it was just as incredible as before! We will definitely be back. The thought that they put into every little detail, their communication and friendliness, the space itself and the location is everything! Thank you so much for sharing your piece of heaven with us!"
10185,192,"We stayed in the cabin for two nights while visiting the Smokies for the leaves changing. The cabin was well appointed, and had nice personal touches. The renovations are nice.
The location is remote, and the Wi-Fi was slow as stated. It didn’t really bother us at all. We did not use the TV.
We would stay here again."
10186,192,"This is a wonderful place, quiet and peaceful.
Sitting on the front porch listening to the water running over the rocks was so relaxing.
We would definitely book this place again!"
10187,192,wonderful cabin nestled into the Smokies....well appointed and furnished. fantastic
10188,192,"This is the perfect cabin for a couples getaway! The location is down a quiet, gravel road (which we were able to easily traverse in a sedan). The cabin itself is very cute and clean. The amenities were nice, there were plenty of towels, and check-in was simple and smooth. If you’re looking for a true getaway in a beautiful setting, this is a great place!"
10189,192,"We enjoyed our stay at the cabin! It was beautiful, cozy, and clean. It’s a little off the beaten path so be prepared to navigate a gravel/narrow road and disconnect from the internet (there is some wifi for simple texting). Weren’t able to use the smart tv for streaming. The bed was comfortable as well."
10190,192,"Truly a good location for exploring the surrounding area. Craig & Anna have a quaint, cozy cabin that is perfect for two."
10191,192,Thank you for opening up your lovely cabin. We had a wonderful weekend and loved everything about your perfect location.
10192,192,It’s a very comfortable and cute place. Coffee machine is an added bonus. Great location easy to get in and out.
10193,192,We had an incredibly relaxing time at Craig and Anna's. It's a beautiful location and really well equipped. Great as a base to explore the Smokies.
10194,192,"This cabin is a great escape. It’s right on the creek and well appointed. We loved listening to the creek. The shower is great, and the fairy lights on the deck are mood setting. The nespresso machine was a nice bonus! Easy to drive into Dillsboro and Sylva to explore."
10195,192,Very well designed a in nicely located put of the way but easy to get to area attractions. You've got to visit Cherokee and get on the Blue Ridge Parkway for a day trip to Waynesville or even Asheville. Ideal mountain getaway!
10196,192,"This cabin is the perfect hideaway to rest, reset and renew your mind, body and soul! The view is amazing and very serene. The location is perfect within 20 minutes of Cherokee, Bryson City and Sylva but far enough out you really feel secluded. Cabin was very clean, bed was perfect, communication was spot on. You wont want to leave and youll be missing this place once you do leave! Wifi signal is strong, I had zoom calls without any issues. Thankful they had a house phone since cell signal isnt great. I personally loved sitting on the deck and enjoying the sounds of the creek. Second best is having the windows and doors open whilst napping. Everything was exactly as described and this is hands down the best airbnb I've ever stayed in! Will be back 🥰"
10197,192,"Cabin was in a great location - close to hiking and activities with lots of good restaurants in the area. It was peaceful and quiet, and easy to find.

Excellent communication. Very quick to respond to our questions.

We really enjoyed our stay!"
10198,192,"My boyfriend and I had a great stay at this cabin. It is perfectly located for outdoor activities or exploring nearby small towns. The back patio is gorgeous and great for morning coffee. The only other things I wanted to note were that although the cabin is clean, there were cobwebs in many corners, which need to be cleaned. Furthermore, the neighbors have their dog on a leash for most of the daytime, who seems to bark anytime you sit on the back patio or walk out to your car. Other than that, we had a lovely stay!"
10199,192,"Craig and Anna,
We loved your cabin. It was just what we needed after taking our son to college in Nashville. It was so peaceful and relaxing. The creek was fun. We enjoyed ourselves very much. We ate our meals on the porch and the view was so sweet. Very nice and comfortable inside the cabin too. The only thing we wished we had more of were clothes hangers but it wasn’t a big concern at all. Loved spending the day in nature and ending it there too. Thank you so much for sharing such a lovely dwelling. We would definitely come again.
Be well,
Karen and Lance"
10200,192,We enjoyed the central location of this cabin to many popular attractions and things to do. This cabin may have been centrally located but it was still far enough away that it offered peace and quiet so that my husband and I could relax without being bothered by loud noises. It was super easy to check in and out. It was well worth it! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and are hoping to stay again soon!
10201,192,"2nd time staying here, really enjoy the seclusion and serenity of this cabin."
10202,192,"The cabin was great! Very much enjoyed sitting out on the porch, sipping coffee, and listening to the water running over the rocks in the creek. Would happily stay there again."
10203,192,Anna and Craig’s cabin was just as described and more! It was a perfect romantic getaway for my fiancé and I to reconnect and celebrate our engagement. The cabin was so peaceful and the creek is so tranquil and serene! Will definitely be back again!
10204,192,Very clean and comfortable cabin. Nice porch overlooking a creek. Very peaceful.
10205,192,"What a wonderful stay! The cabin is beautiful and cozy and clean. We loved sitting on the porch and listening to the creek and watching the fireflies. The kitchen is well stocked with everything you need to cook, and plenty of good-quality coffee was available. I highly recommend!"
10206,192,"This place was adorable and just the getaway I was looking for. The sound from the stream out on either of the decks was a great start and end to each day:) The bed was comfortable, the wifi was strong, and the kitchen had what we needed for cooking in. I was in town for a wedding nearby and the location was accessible to all that we needed for a great weekend. Would highly recommend!"
10207,192,"Cottage is stocked well with comforts of home.
Bring a jacket is gets cool here 😎
You won't wanna leave!"
10208,192,"Beautiful place, great little getaway to get some peace and quiet. Best part would have to be the creek!"
10209,192,The cabin was a perfect location for our trip. It was centrally located for riding motorcycles in the area. Very peaceful and comfortable!
10210,192,"cozy, clean and very relaxing"
10211,192,"It was the best, private and secluded, we ate all of our meals at home and had everything we needed. The creek was so much fun to play in. Also love the Nespresso."
10212,192,"Lovely little spot! Appreciated special touches like candles, plenty of firewood, puzzles, books, outdoor string lights, house slippers, kitchen and bathroom necessities. The sound of the river is a dream. Can get a bit buggy so I’d pack some bug spray. (I was outside a fair bit, though, and it’s summer.) And yes, there are neighbors, but the house still feels very private, especially when you’re sitting outside the bedroom near the fire pit. I came to do some writing and had a productive, peaceful stay. Would definitely return."
10213,192,Fantastic stay! Perfect getaway for a couple looking to relax. Excellent location. So many birds to watch and listen to. The trees all around are fantastic and the flowing creek is the best part. The hosts were very thoughtful to include a rope to help you down to visit the creek. We would love to stay again!
10214,192,Beautiful cabin. Quiet. Peaceful. All around a great getaway place !
10215,192,"This is a little of a mixed bag review. Mostly positive things, but there were some things that bothered me about the stay as a whole. Meh stuff first:

The Meh:
- I wasn't aware that there would be neighbors. And by that, I meant hat the neighbors share a driveway with this property. That's totally fine, but I had been expecting more seclusion and it took me a minute to get past that.
- The neighbors have very loud, kind of aggressive dogs that they keep on a lead outside during the day. It's hard to enjoy my time away if whenever I go outside a dog comes running down the drive barking and growling at me. I don't have a dog phobia, but I can imagine that this could be traumatic for someone who does.
- No pot holders in the kitchen. At least that I couldn't find. Ended up using a wash cloth from the bathroom to get stuff out of the oven. This is getting nitpicky, though.

The Good:
- Spotless place. Super clean and well laid out.
- The back porch off of the bedroom is nice and private.
- You could explore the wildlife management area that backs up to the cabin if you're so inclined. (I was. It was fun.)
- 30 minutes away from the NOC and the GSMNP
- We couldn't find any dry wood, but I'm sure that the wood stove is nice if you could get a fire going in it.

Overall a good experience. I probably won't be staying here again, though, because I prefer to seek out the more remote places when I visit this area."
10216,192,"Hi Caleb,

We are sorry that you did not have an ideal experience. We are in the middle of a national forest but we do have neighbors; only one is visible from the front door and they are about 100 feet away from us on top of a hill. The only time you see them is when you are walking to your car. Our balcony faces the creek and we have a privacy divider to shield you from the neighbors’ view. They do have a dog, but when he is outside he is always leashed up and cannot come near the property.

So far we have had over 120 stays and our guestbook is full of testimonials of how much our visitors have loved the tranquility of our porch with several marriage proposals and multiple returning guests. -Craig and Anna"
10217,192,Beautiful Cabin! The creek in the front is a huge plus! So relaxing!
10218,192,Great Place! Beautiful creek. Perfect location. Will definitely be back again.
10219,192,Wonderful cabin with an amazing view of the creek.
10220,192,"We immediately fell in love with Craig and Ana's cabin. We were greeted by fresh flowers on the coffee table and beautiful lights on porch. We explored the small towns in the area, but we loved coming back to that porch and the sound of the creek below. The cabin was decorated so well. Very inviting! We found everything we needed. Like others have said, the internet could be spotty, but it was actually really nice to unplug and relax for an entire week. We would definitely love to come back."
10221,192,We really enjoyed our stay. The bed was very comfortable and the cabin so is cozy.
10222,192,We had an excellent stay at Craig’s and Anna’s cabin. It was immaculately cleaned and very comfortable. The running creek out front was so charming! Great location - Dillsboro is a must!
10223,192,"This was such a wonderful, peaceful and cozy place! We loved it. We will mostly miss the deck right up from the creek... so serene. I just wish we had more time to spend there. We had 2 short days. It was a home away from home, but upgraded because of the decks and creek. Craig and Anna were great too... always quickly responded and helpful. Highly recommend!"
10224,192,"This is such a beautiful and cozy place to stay. Lots of outdoor seating to enjoy the sounds of the creek below. It was extremely clean and well equipped with linens, kitchen supplies, and more. I will definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to stay in the area."
10225,192,The cutest little cabin!! Wish we could have only stayed longer
10226,192,Such a perfect cabin for a unplugged vacation!
10227,192,"This was a lovely place to stay! We spent our weekend at the cabin enjoying some spring snow showers by the wood stove and cooking great food in the kitchen. The porch would be perfect for warmer days. Lots of easy access to beautiful hikes. Clean, easy to find, quiet area, and clear attention to detail to making the house cozy."
10228,192,"This is the perfect little cabin if you’re looking for a clean, modern cabin in the middle of the blue ridge parkway. Just less than an hour away from Asheville and only 15 mins away from sylva, our favorite mountain town! To s of hikes and local restaurants/breweries nearby. We especially loved the big porch near the creek. We hope to visit again in the future!"
10229,192,Definitely a beautiful place to stay we loved the cabin! We definitely will be back for another stay!! Very peaceful!
10230,192,A great location with gorgeous views. The cabin was beautiful. The owners did a fantastic job with everything!
10231,192,We’ve stayed at a lots of Airbnb’s and this one really is as it’s described! Clean and super cute! Only wish it was warmer so we could listen to the creek all night long with the doors/windows open! Go no further and book this adorable cabin now!
10232,192,"Clean, quiet, out-of-the-way cabin. Enjoyed the stay."
10233,192,"We’ve been doing Airbnb for several years now and this was one of our favorite stays yet! It was spotless. It was exactly as described. It was in the absolute perfect location that was nestled in the woods near a creek but only 10 minutes to a cute little town named Dillsboro where we found unique shops, fabulous restaurants and a brewery. The wood stove made it nice evening for us to sit around the fire and chat. With 5 kids my husband and I rarely get away on our own.. so thankful we found this rare gem. Some reviews mentioned the WiFi but we had no issues with it.. streamed Netflix and FaceTimed out littles ones without any difficulty. We will definitely be back!"
10234,192,"The Creekside Hideaway Cabin is truly a unique hideaway. We loved the setup of the cabin and the porch by the briskly rushing creek. The cabin is ultra clean - the cleanest I've ever stayed in and we respected the 'leave the shoes at the door' policy. The bed is comfortable and shower awesome. Everything you need for a great and private stay is provided. This location is very convenient to Cherokee, Waynesville and Sylva. I would love to stay again and will definitely keep it on my list of favorites when visiting the area, especially once warmer weather hits. The porch is fabulous."
10235,192,"LOVELY LOCATION and a peaceful respite at the end of each day we hiked! It was nice to be able to food prep' our picnic for each day's hike and cook dinner while we negotiated who got the first hot shower. Because we AIRBNB a lot while national park hiking, we had our electric skillet and hot pot which helped with cooking and tea/coffee in the morning. If connectivity and dinner-with-a-movie are essential will find this location to be a challenge. Other than the need for some kitchen supply 'edits' this is an off-the-beaten-path beautiful place to unwind."
10236,192,"Comfortable, quiet and peaceful retreat in the mountains! Cozy, warm well appointed cabin."
10237,192,Beautiful home! It was in the middle of the mountains with beautiful scenery everyday. We loved being able to wake up and hear the creek. Definitely would stay here again! It was a great time!!
10238,192,"Craig and Annas cabin was so wonderful! We stayed for our first anniversary and it was perfect. The sound of the stream and the wood-fire stove! We loved walking around the historic town of Sylva, too! We’d stay again!"
10239,192,We absolutely loved our stay in the cabin. It was gorgeous and so romantic! We will be back.
10240,192,Excellent stay. Small but spacious. Bring a grill if you plan to cook
10241,192,"This place was amazing. Right by an awesome creek in the middle of the woods. Very private and relaxing. The Wi-Fi was very spotty and there was no cell reception but that’s to be expected being in the middle of the woods.
Definitely will be back!"
10242,192,10/10 would go again
10243,192,We loved this cozy little cabin! It was very cold so we got plenty of use of the wood stove and it even snowed during our stay! Love it and hope to return one day!
10244,192,"This was our second time staying at Craig and Annas and it was even more relaxing and magical than before! The cabin is clean, cozy, and well stocked with essentials and you can’t beat the location. It’s close to the highway but feels much more isolated. We especially love the wood stove inside and all the fire supplies. Can’t wait to go back!"
10245,192,"What a wonderful cabin that lives up to all the reviews! Please don’t hesitate to book this place. Very peaceful, beautiful and serene!! Will definitely book again!!"
10246,192,Very nice and cozy place! Loved the sound of the creek. We enjoyed our stay!
10247,192,"This cabin is 100% hands down the best air bnb I’ve ever stayed in. Hosts are amazing, location is private and perfect, the creek and waterfall are beautiful and I could just go on and on. Will be back for sure! 💕💕💕💕💕💕"
10248,192,Really cozy and cute cabin convenient to Sylva
10249,192,"Loved staying at this cabin. It was cozy, private and relatively easy to get to. Everything worked great, and It’s stocked with everything you need. My husband and I enjoyed very much and we were extremely pleased with the property and accommodations. Thanks Craig and Anna!"
10250,192,"Absolutely loved my stay! Super clean, incredible location...can't say enough good things about it! Will definitely return!! :)"
10251,192,The cabin was really beautiful and the river next to it was so peaceful
10252,192,So beautiful and worth the stay!!
10253,192,Cutest cabin ever! We truly enjoyed our stay at Anna and Craig's cabin and will be sure to stay here again when we are back in Sylva. The place was a perfect size for two guests with everything you will need already there. Thank you!
10254,192,"If you are looking for a beautiful cabin for two, in the mountains, then this is the cabin. It's well appointed, comfortable, beautifully decorated and is centrally located to short trips in surrounding areas - Cherokee, Bryson City (highly recommend the Steam Train excursion), Sylva (LuLu's on Main St is a must to eat at) and even Helen, Ga (while in the area, make sure to hike Anna Ruby Falls). We thoroughly enjoyed our time staying at Craig & Ann's great cabin!"
10255,192,"This cute and cozy cabin made for a perfect stay! They had helpful recommendations for local places to eat, hike, etc. and the places did not disappoint! Would definitely recommend!"
10256,192,Great place to stay!
10257,192,"Quaint little cabin in the mountains with a relaxing creek out front to help you unwind from being constantly connected. Start your day sitting outside, watching the sun crawl down the mountain side and listen to the creek rushing by below. End your day in front of the wood burning stove with a roaring fire, your favorite beverage and reconnecting with those you love over conversation or the provided games. To fill the time in between, there are many hikes, waterfalls, breweries and cute little small towns to visit - all a short drive from this cabin. The hosts provide many everyday essentials that travelers don’t always think of (toilet paper, trash bags, paper towels). Plenty of firewood to keep the wood burning stove going too. A note - you will unplug here as it’s “Mountain WiFi”, temper your expectations if you need to stream Netflix. You will be able to read emails and send text messages using the WiFi, but we had little success beyond that. Also, cell phone reception is spotty - but wasn’t a problem for us as the host provided a landline to make dinner reservations etc. It was actually very nice not being glued to a device constantly. Some reviewers previous to us mentioned a lack of cookware but we prepared many meals and found we had everything we needed."
10258,194,"This was our 2nd time staying at Gwens. Again it was very clean, quiet and cozy in addition
to being a very convenient location to our family in Hampstead. Highly recommend!"
10259,194,"Gwen’s place is just as adorable in person as it is in the pictures! She was easy to connect with.

She has taken great care to not only decorate it beautifully, but is also deeply intentional and thoughtful in her space. I’d love to come back and stay awhile longer!

Thank you! 🖤"
10260,194,"Thanks Gwen,

Dave and Bev"
10261,194,"Gwen’s place was a breath of fresh air. We felt right at home as soon as we walked in. Nicely decorated and relaxing. “Beautifully done, like out of a magazine”, quotes my other half, Steve. Gwen and Brian were friendly and welcoming. We will definitely book again if ever in the area."
10262,194,"Hands down, the best airbnb, I have ever stayed in.!!!Gewn made everything simple....... highly reccomend this airbnb!!! everything was perfect!!!!!"
10263,194,"If you are looking to travel to Topsail Island, Surf City, and Wilmington: this is a great centrally located place to stay and will quickly become your home away from home during your travels. Such a great, beautifully decorated space to stay: you will feel instantly welcomed and at home. My advice when looking for a place to stay in the area: stay with Gwen at her Air B and B. I'm glad we decided to stay here: this is was such a great find!!"
10264,194,We stayed here as a family and felt right at home. Gwen did a fabulous job with the decor and the perfect spot for our family of 4. Felt extremely private and a great location! Close to Surf City and Wilmington! Hosts were super friendly and accommodating!
10265,194,Our stay was very peaceful and easy! The Airbnb was much bigger than we expected and have everything we needed. Thank you for the wonderful stay.

10268,194,Gwen’s place was awesome! We loved that it’s its own place. The scenery was great! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!
10269,194,"'Retreat' is the perfect name for this lovely space. It's exactly as pictured and described in the listing. Which is to say it's cozy, quaint, crisp, comfortable in every way and delightfully decorated with a coastal flair. It was close and convenient for all that brought us to the area. Gwen was responsive and flexible when we asked for a last-minute change in our dates to accommodate a snowstorm at home. Gwen and Brian were friendly and welcoming hosts, whom we enjoyed bumping into while coming and going in their lovely setting. What a gem to share with the Airbnb community - much appreciated!"
10270,194,We had to be in Hampstead to help a family member through a surgery. It was a stressful time but Gwen's place was the perfect place to decompress and relax. The apartment has everything we needed and has very comfortable furniture. I just could not get over how very quaint and beautifully appointed it is! Gwen is a delightful person and responded to our inquiries via email almost immediately no matter the time of day! We will definitely stay there again!!
10271,194,Our stay was great. We were only in town for one evening visiting family. Gwen's place was cozy and perfect for our stay.
10272,194,Gwen’s place is cute and comfortable! It had everything we needed for a quick overnight stay.
10273,194,"Gwen’s place is in a picturesque, quiet, wooded neighborhood off the beaten path yet convenient to Wilmington with plenty of restaurants and businesses nearby. We enjoyed the beautifully kept grounds, and the garage apartment was spotless and welcoming with a nautical motif. Perfect for the two of us! I enjoyed my coffee at the kitchen window both mornings watching the songbirds, jays, squirrels, and woodpeckers forage and fuss. We even spotted a doe and her yearling fawn one evening on our way in from dinner. If you are looking for a little peace and quiet in a cozy, well appointed place near Wilmington, look no further…I know my wife and I will check availability at Gwen’s first any time we plan a trip to this area!"
10274,194,"it turned out to be a wonderful holiday, very comfortable accommodation, if we are in that city again, we will be happy to stay again. recommend."

10286,194,This is Avery clean beautiful apartment which is close to Topsoil and lots of things to do. My husband and I loved staying here.
10287,194,We had a wonderful stay and everything was excellent.
10288,194,"Gwen communicated well and was quick to respond.
I highly recommend her place."
10289,194,"Beautiful apartment! Quiet, clean, was a nice retreat! Only thing to note is that we didn’t expect to interact with the hosts but we changed plans last minute and included a guest #3 and when a man approached our Uber to ask about the third person we thought it was a bit rude and scary since it was in the evening. There were no introductions but later learned he was the the host’s husband, could have been handled via message. Other than that beautiful place. A little bit far from restaurants and such but not terrible for a last minute booking."
10290,194,"Gwen’s garage apartment was great! Amazing location, so peaceful and quiet and really pretty with the landscaping. Everything was clean, nice, and communication was a breeze with her. Thanks for a great stay!"
10291,194,Great host

10296,194,"What a lovely little apartment! This place is welcoming, comfortable, and clean! It is well stocked with essentials in the kitchen and extra linens and bedding to tailor your sleep to your preference. Gwen was super accommodating and responsive, and we would definitely stay here again! :)"
10297,194,"This cottage was decorated adorably, well-equipped, clean, comfortable and close to beaches Gwen was very accommodating and friendly, fantastic hosts!"
10298,194,"Great Hosts and location. This place has everything a small family needs. I highly recommend.
Easy 20-25min access to beaches!!!"
10299,194,"Gwen's place was absolutely wonderful! A beautiful getaway tucked in a nice quiet community! We don't like to bother hosts on trips, but Gwen was very attentive to us and wanted to make sure our stay was peaceful. It's not too far from the beach, which is nice when you want to enjoy the beach, but don't want to be in the heart of traffic and people! When we're back down in Topsail, we'll be looking for any listings by Gwen!"
10300,194,"Great host, beautiful place and surroundings. Gwen has done an amazing job of making the place warm, welcoming and very cozy."
10301,194,"My wife & I enjoyed our 2 night stay. Bathroom & kitchens were well supplied.
The space was very clean and good ac kept it comfortable when it was super hot & humid out.
Very safe & quiet neighborhood. Would stay again for sure."

Thanks so much."
10305,194,"Too brief, next time!!"
10306,194,Gwen did an amazing job! Beautiful house close to family’s
10307,194,"After your kind words and the lovely note you guys wrote, I am disappointed with your rating. Since you are first time AirBnB users, I am hoping that you didn’t understand the importance. Please know that your rating affects our business."
10308,194,"Very cozy, convenient and clean - perfect for someone wanting to be hear Hampstead or Topsail!!"
10309,194,"Gwen’s place is a great stay for a trip! The location is perfect to keep you busy on your vacation, as well as peaceful if you’re aiming for a more relaxing time. It is in a nice quiet neighborhood with plenty of privacy. It’s a tranquil spot to come back to after a long day on the beach, or a trip to Wilmington - which are both a short distance away. The charming beach decor makes you feel like you’re right on the beach, and the informative maps and personal lists of activities and restaurants was a lovely extra touch."
10310,194,"Great, clean place with a quick drive to the beach."
10311,194,Very clean and adorable!
10312,194,"The apartment is so cozy and comfortable! It’s decorated beautifully and really makes you feel at home. The area is beautiful and close to grocery stores, pharmacies, restaurants, etc. It’s a short drive to Topsail and Wilmington. We loved staying here and will definitely be back!"

Very, very clean with everything you need."

10315,194,"We love coming here. Our stay was fantastic. Everything is clean, organized and top-notch. We will be coming back soon."
10316,194,"Gwen’s place is absolutely lovely. The neighborhood is quiet and lush with green trees and gorgeous plant life all around. The apartment itself is fabulous. The kitchen was easy to navigate and made it easy to dine in, but also there were suggestions of excellent places to check out as well. Easy drive to the beach, too. The place is clean, bright and welcoming. I loved the book selections too! Lots of local lore. A wonderful respite from busy city life, for sure! Highly recommended!"
10317,194,The host was awesome! The place looked amazing and we enjoyed the stay.
10318,194,Homey little spot tucked inside a quiet neighborhood.
10319,194,"BOOK NOW! This is the cutest airbnb i’ve stayed in in years! So clean, accommodating, and the perfect distance to any beach! We truly enjoyed the privacy & the great communication with the host, Gwen!"

10323,194,lovely spot! my best friend and i were passing through the area for a concert at the pavilion. quick drive to downtown wilmington.
10324,194,Highly recommend going to Shuckin Shack and ask for Trish!
10325,194,"This is one of the very best Airbnb's I have ever stayed in. It is beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean. Everything about it is quality, and it is clear the owners take great care with their rental. The beds are so comfortable, including the sofa bed, which is very rare. It has great support without annoying metal rods. There are lots of amenities, including drinks and snacks. And the hosts are very kind with great communication. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
10326,194,"Very nice, private, and relaxing!"
10327,194,Gwen’s place was perfect for our group of 4. Communication was seamless and the check in/check out process was very simple. Would highly recommend staying here!
10328,194,Beautiful place to stay for our quick trip to Wilmington! Gwen was very helpful and quick to respond! We would stay here again!
10329,194,We cannot say enough about how relaxing and peaceful our stay at Gwen’s FROG was. It was the cleanest Airbnb we have ever stayed in and had such a calming feel to it with the woods outside your window and deers in the morning. We stayed with two young children and it was very comfortable. Thank you Gwen for such a nice week!
10330,194,Everything you would expect plus more!
10331,194,"clean , well stocked, beautifully decorated. comfortable beds and furnishings. great access to beaches, stores, local restaurants and Wilmington. quiet tree lined neighborhood."
10332,194,"We had such a great time and left refreshed. The area and the neighborhood especially was so peaceful. Exactly what we needed. Everything we needed was there, the beds were comfortable and the place was very clean. Thank you!"
10333,194,a very quiet and relaxing place. I recommend to everyone
10334,194,"You can't find a more hospitable and caring host than Gwen. She has designed her carriage house apartment with terrific taste, and the setting is spectacular. I can't wait to return. You will feel the same way. Kathy R."
10335,194,Wonderful hosts and very helpful answering all of our questions
10336,195,"It is immaculate! Lovely view. Neighbors made it field a bit iffy! John felt uncomfortable leave my me by myself. Could not tell if neighbors were home or not, which felt a bit less private."
10337,195,"This place is amazing and exactly like the photos. We loved the house, fire pit, tether ball, and the hot tub!

The location is as perfect as you can get and the host made it so easy to get in and enjoy yourself.

We will definitely stay again."
10338,195,Our family stayed at the red shed for 3 days and it was a great chance to connect with nature as well as each other. We had an fun tether ball competition and used the hot tub twice a day. Overall our stay was relaxing and a very calming mountain experience.
10339,195,My husband and I had a fantastic time at the Red Shed!!! The view is absolutely gorgeous and the amenities were great! Just make sure to bring a capable vehicle as the drive up is quite bumpy. Would definitely recommend!
10340,195,"My fiancee and I wanted a little weekend getaway to be alone and enjoy the mountains. This place was perfect and incredible. Very beautiful views from every point in and out of the cabin. Celeste and Philip were very responsive and informative, we enjoyed every minute we were there. Highly reccommend!!"
10341,195,"This place is Airbnb Plus material. A stunningly fresh and cohesive design paired with an awe inspiring view and no detail left unthought of. It’s spotless and chock full of amenities: a kitchen fully stocked with above average quality items, firewood ready for the fire pit, luxurious linens and plenty of soft towels, and a relaxing hot tub with a beautiful view of the mountains and the sunset through the trees. This was truly the best AirBnb experience we’ve had. Celeste and Phillip deserve an incredible amount of recognition for the work they have clearly put into this space. You can feel the warmth of their welcome in the carefully chosen decor throughout the space as well as the manual that has loads of helpful information to reference throughout your stay. Absolutely fantastic! We’ll be back!"
10342,195,Wow thank you Meagan for your thoughtful review it means so much to us!
10343,195,"Okay, this place was amazing!! It was the cutest cabin with modern updated decor, peaceful surroundings and well equipped with everything you could need from kitchen seasonings to body wash and hair products. We go to cabins very frequently and this one really impressed. For the size of the cabin, it felt luxurious and tranquil. The outside area was fantastic with a covered hot tub, fire pit and swings. The deck overlooked a breathtaking view. It really felt like a resort! We loved every detail of this cabin, well done!"
10344,195,The recent remodel of this property was extraordinary!
10345,195,"This cabin was a breathe of fresh air. A great escape from our daily routines of work and juggling two young kids. The views are incredible and it was the cleanest Airbnb we’ve ever stayed at. The hot tub and chair swings were the cherries on top to our wonderful stay. We love the small town feel of Bryson City, and plan to make it a yearly trip!"
10346,195,"This is a wonderful place to stay. We felt right at home when we walked in. They are very responsive and very helpful. Checking up on you, making sure you’re doing good, etc. We will definitely be coming back!"

10358,206,"Stunning views, peaceful location! Would definitely stay here again if we had an easier time with our AWD SUV…couldn’t get it up the drive and tried twice. So it made a steep back and forth with bags throughout the trip. We felt we were at the top of the world though! Loved it! Much smaller in size than expected- but it only bring 2 of us - it was fine!"
10359,206,"If you want peaceful and secluded, this is the place to be; only a few times was I reminded that other people existed. Most of the sounds are from hawks circling overheard and finches scrounging on the ground, and the night sky is bright with stars. Be prepared to give your thoughts plenty of space to roam and be free.

The treehouse is well stocked with hammocks, fire tools, board games, pots and pans, kitchen staples, all kinds of things to make the stay effortless and cozy. I didn't need to bring anything more than a book and some food. The area also gets great cell/data service with Verizon.

Some pro tips:
* The ladder to the loft tilts at an angle and isn't used straight up and down (I feel silly for not realizing this).
* There are switches by the hot tub and on the outside wall for turning off the string lights so you can see the stars.
* The place is actually on G Maps and was accurate for me, surprisingly, given how remote it is.

I hope I get to visit again in the future."
10360,206,This is THE place! The view is amazing all the way around this spot! The house is super clean and cute. Host was very nice and quick to respond! I’ll absolutely be coming back!
10361,206,"My wife and I stayed for two nights and had a wonderful time. The views were spectacular and really peaceful. We were just a short drive from restaurants and National Park trails, etc. We hiked to Rainbow Falls one afternoon. It was a great weekend getaway location, highly recommend it!!!"
10362,206,Great place to relax!
10363,206,"We loved our stay at the treehouse! It’s very remote and at the top of a steep driveway, but was not any trouble for our 4 wheel drive vehicle. Amazing views and lots to do in nearby towns."
10364,206,Amazing place for a private retreat in nature. Make sure to have 4WD or pack lightly but beautiful place overall. We will be back forsure. Can’t recommend enough
10365,206,My stay was an absolutely perfect getaway. I loved how private the house was and how it had everything you would need. Ryan was very helpful and responsive with any questions I had. The location was remote but close to so many great hikes. Just overall a really great experience!
10366,206,"Best place
Ever"
10367,206,My wife and I went for the weekend and had a relaxing time. The views were amazing and the host described everything to a tee. We will definitely be back.
10368,206,It was the perfect place to get away from the city life for a weekend!
10369,206,Exactly what we were looking for to get away and disconnect!
10370,206,Awesome to be in the jacuzzi with this wonderful view on the mountains. This caban is a perfect place to disconnect and recharge !
10371,206,"We had such an incredible time at Ryan’s treehouse! The views are breathtaking, he communicated quickly any time we had a question and the interior of the treehouse was adorable! He even allowed a late check out since our first day there was rained out. Highly recommend!!!"
10372,206,Great host!
10373,206,"The Pisgah Paradise treehouse exceeded our expectations! Extremely private, amazing views, nicely updated treehouse that was very well stocked with everything you could need. Hot tub was hot and clean. Everything was 100% as described, and identical to the photos. We had the best time there, on top of the mountain with no one else around! Ryan was a great host, quick to respond and very helpful. Treehouse is convenient to Brevard, and the Headwaters Outfitters right at the bottom of the mountain was an added bonus. We can't wait to come back!"
10374,216,Charles was very communicative and gracious when plans to bring our dog fell through. He promptly refunded the pet deposit. House was like the photos. Our only negative was that the bathroom of the Airbnb had not been well cleaned before our arrival. The linens were fresh but there were crumbs on the counters and hairs in the shower/sink.
10375,216,We loved our stay at Charles place. The beautiful scenery and privacy is everything. Noticed a sign that said F Biden at the next door neighbors house but idc about politicians Lol but felt safe in the forest environment and we will definitely be back. Thank you for opening your doors so we could enjoy this lovely experience.
10376,216,"Charles’s home was amazing. Secluded, beautiful and peaceful. We had a week of activities planned and ended up staying at the home all but one day. Bed was super comfy, felt very open and full of natural light. Garage is insane..we wish we had brought our dog to enjoy it! Very quiet and dark at night but that was to be expected and we enjoyed it. Despite the other comments about the neighbors, as a interracial couple with a 4 month old we had no issues and honestly felt completely safe. People have their opinions but they kept completely to themselves. We ended up taking a 4WD vehicle last second as we are glad we did. Charles recommended it on his listing and for good reason. Wi-Fi worked great and all the appliances were great as well! We will definitely be returning!"
10377,216,"The driveway is a little rough but don’t let that fool you. This is a beautiful home in the mountains. We loved the incredible view of the French Broad River and the surrounding mountains that was out the back. You can hear the river when you’re outside. The location is incredible, a short drive to downtown Marshall and Hot Springs. Both towns have a great downtown area full of good restaurants and shops. There is a ton of great hiking to choose from (500+ trails) within 2 hours or less. Many of these trails are under an hour away."
10378,216,"This place is absolutely gorgeous, the driveway isn’t to bad if your used to driving in the mountains/country didn’t have to use our 4WD. House was very clean and very pretty, beautiful Mountain View’s and sounds of the river. Very remote and peaceful if you are not used to the country it could be eerie but me and my husband loved it."
10379,216,"The views was amazing, i will be back. Charles was awsome. This was my first time at the mountains i will differently be back. I loved everything."
10380,216,The place was very simple yet clean. It was very quiet and at night eerily quiet. Confederate flags and f Biden signs before the drive way. Not ideal and frankly frightening when you first arrive. DO NOT ARRIVE at night if you haven’t been there before. The host did mention this in the check in instructions. We really didn’t have a choice. 4 x 4 an absolute must and expect a VERY bumpy drive up and down. Once the sun comes up there is a nice walking path where you can see the French broad River and deer. Bed is pretty darn comfortable. Smart TVs in both the living room and bedroom. Bathroom was clean. Kitchen had snacks and host was very responsive.
10381,216,Had a great weekend away. Enjoyed the views and peace and quiet. Charles was extremely responsive and answered any and all questions we had during our stay.
10382,216,"We had a great time staying here, gorgeous location, very clean house, and an awesome garage. Would 100% stay here again.

A 4WD vehicle is definitely recommended for driveway up to house."
10383,216,Our stay here was very nice and peaceful. The house was clean and there is plenty of space. The garage was massive and the fire pit in the back was perfectly set up. As well as a nice view of the river just a few yards from the house.
10384,216,"Great experience all the way around. Super friendly and responsive host. A beautiful, peaceful property."
10385,216,"If you are looking for privacy, this is the place! Peace and quiet with a view, couldn’t ask for much more!"
10386,216,Great place. Exactly as advertised and as stated in the reviews. Very remote. Great view of the French Broad River
10387,216,"Amazing private location, gorgeous views. Home is renovated / cozy and comfortable. Have 4 wheel drive to get up to driveway. Host is very responsive"
10388,216,Wished we had better weather to enjoy the views but they were still spectacular! The home was very clean and well put together.
10389,216,"Pros- We enjoyed our stay. it was definitely secluded and quiet. The decorations were cute, the kitchen had everything we needed. The bed was small, but comfy! The view on the walking path was beautiful! Charles was very responsive and answered any questions we had very quickly!

Cons- The driveway was awful, I highly recommend a 4x4 vehicle. I would not have felt comfortable in a car. The home is very secluded, so it did give me a very eerie vibe(my husband didn’t seem to mind). I’m not sure what the home was before remodeled into a home, maybe a barn or something. The garage was huge but we could not hang out in there due to the whole thing reeking of fire/smoke. We could barely open the door without it making the rest of the home smell."
10390,216,"We loved staying at this house. So beautiful and clean. We stayed for about 2 weeks.

The only thing is the drive up to the house is a little sketchy but we did it a ton of times (and in a Prius.)

The house has everything you need to live there. Everything was great."
10391,216,Had an amazing stay!!
10392,216,Amazing views great time great place definitely recommend it
10393,216,The hosts were great - communicative and flexible!
10394,216,As others have also stated driving up the gravel road without an all-wheel drive vehicle would be somewhat difficult. I highly recommend coming during the day so you can see clearly the first time. We saw the signs from the neighbor but the neighbor never bothered us. All in all it was a wonderful stay and we would definitely come back. Great responsive host.
10395,216,The Airbnb was an absolutely beautiful spot. You get to experience a private location up in the mountains. The location was in a great spot and close to great hiking spots and Asheville. Also Charles was a great host providing great communication and support. We will definitely be back!
10396,216,"We had a wonderful time here -- so quiet and peaceful, and amazing views of the surrounding mountains at sunset. There's an extended back yard where you can see the river, or if you follow the well-lit path at night, gaze upon endless stars and the Milky Way. The house itself is tastefully decorated with everything we needed, so it felt like a second home we didn't want to leave. Playing Bocce was a lot of fun. There's also the short walk down to the river for a cool dip. Loved it all and would come back again!"
10397,216,"Absolutely loved this stay in regards to the AirBnB and Activities. Host was an angel and very attentive/ responsive.

Highly recommended white water rafting at French Boarder Adventure.

*IMPORTANT PLEASE READ*:
-Drive up is very steep and unpaved please get a 4x4 with high clearance. I got a 4x4 Mazda CX-5 2016 and it was rough to get up.
-WARNING: Neighbor has very rude signs stating “Airbnb get out,” “Vacation renters not welcome,” “Tourist get out.” -POC WARNING: They also have very explicit language, political signs and confederate flags up. As a interracial couple this was very frightening and made us feel unsafe.
The host made us feel reassured and are in no way at fault for their neighbors deplorable signage. We are very grateful to the hosts and hope that the neighbor can grow up."
10398,216,"This was a great place to stay. Not too far from asheville, with beautiful views as you come up/ down from the house."
10399,216,"Peaceful, beautiful, perfect private get away! We loved this mountain top get away! The stars at night stole the show!
Be sure you have a vehicle that can make the climb, (front wheel drive, or 4x4, or weighted down in the back if it is rear wheel drive) it is definitely worth it!
Host were wonderful! We can not wait to get back there!"
10400,216,"Our stay was very peaceful. The property is quiet. The house is stocked with all the necessities and more. The view the mountains is gorgeous. It’s summer so the view of the river is not as wide. The site is breathtaking nonetheless. Many have mentioned the driveway to the property. If you have a choice do not drive a car without AWD or a car that is low to the ground. To be honest the ride up was terrifying in a car and the ride down had some sliding on breaks. This would not be an issue in the right car.

Great house, great host. Just drive the right car."
10401,216,"If you have a car the road was VERY rough, It was hard on my car. Atmosphere of the place was a little off putting. Backyard is gorgeous at sunset and night. Shower pressure was low, not the best- roomy though. Overall, pretty nice place to stay and had a great stay here, however, the road conditions was a huge take back. Had some critters throughout."
10402,216,"Thanks for the feedback! It’s a remote home on top of a mountain so yes the gravel is always gravel, and always some critters time to time in the middle of the woods! Will check on the shower for sure though thx for letting us know and staying with us :)"
10403,216,What a stunning place! We had an incredible stay. The house had everything we needed and Charles was super responsive. Asheville was very accessible. Would highly recommend!
10404,216,Very happy. Kitchen was wonderful. Had everything we needed. Loved the charm and decoration. Very inviting and comfortable.
10405,216,"My stay here was peaceful, enjoyable and exactly what I needed. Only stayed here a few days, but was able to enjoy the scenery. Not far from Ashville either. The host was prompt when replying back to any questions/concerns I had.
Would definitely stay here again."
10406,216,"Had a wonderful stay at this beautifully decorated home with its stunning views. The remote location is a charm, but we still spent time in Marshall and Asheville in just a short drive. Like others have mentioned, the neighbors’ hateful flags are…aggressive, but all that nonsense goes away when you get to the Airbnb. Me and my wife always like to be on the go when we travel but this was the rare exception where we just wanted to spend time relaxing and taking in all this Airbnb has to offer. Can’t recommend more highly."
10407,216,"This place is a gem, drive though the trees and catch a glance of a deer or rabbit. Go out at night and look up at the stars. Comfy bed everything you need for a lovely tidy clean peaceful stay!"
10408,216,"The drive up to the property is very bumpy since it is not a paved road, but the home is very nice and the backyard of the property is beautiful. Very secluded feeling once you are up."
10409,216,Beautiful place just like the pictures. The driveway was a little too precarious in an non four wheel drive car. The neighbors with all flags were a bit concerning as non Caucasian individual but we didn’t have any other issues other than feeling a bit weary. None the less a great get away from everything with a beautiful view
10410,216,"Very cool spot; spectacular views. Isolated if that’s what you’re looking for, DT Marshall is about 20 mins away. Def stop at the store on your way in and get wood & marshmallows to build a bonfire! Charles was great, responded right away to any questions."
10411,216,"This house was amazing! It was super spacious and had everything needed to cook/prepare meals. The drive up to the home was slightly terrifying, but we made it up driving a Toyota Corolla and a Toyota Prius (so if we can do it, you can too). There are a lot of confederate flags and Trump propaganda (including explicit language) being displayed by the neighbors. This was unsettling to us and I worry that others might feel unsafe upon arrival. It is important to note that the owner has no control over what is/isn't displayed by their neighbors. Other than that, our stay was wonderful and the view from the property is incredible. This house is perfect for anyone looking for a secluded ""Asheville"" trip!"
10412,216,The house was bigger than we expected and very nicely updated. The views from the backyard are incredible and made only better since they are private.
10413,216,"Amazing place. Amazing location, very remote which we loved. Amazing view of stars."
10414,216,"The pictures accurately describe this beautiful home. The location is very secluded and peaceful. The home was very clean and full of essential amenities. Highly recommend the stay, perfect couples getaway!"
10415,216,"This place was exactly as described. Very secluded, quiet, and great views. We saw lots of rabbits, a few deer, and turkeys during the stay. The place was very clean and inviting and they had snacks and coffee waiting. Would definitely recommend."
10416,216,"Lovely house atop a hill! The place is exactly as pictured, and the landscape is beautiful."
10417,216,Lovely. Lovely. Lovely. as advertised and more.
10418,216,"What a beautiful stay, the views, the fire pit, and the home were perfect! No cell reception but perfect Wi-Fi, everything you need, toaster, coffee, refrigerator and stove and all the utensils, such a perfect, peaceful stay! We enjoyed all the wildflowers, seeing deer off the back deck, husband saw a lizard and bunnies, walked down to enjoy that beautiful Mountain View everyday, the bed, linens, and couches were very comfortable and the home is beautifully decorated inside."
10419,216,"Nice house, great location if you want to be in nature, and Charles was very responsive when needed."
10420,216,"If you’re looking for a quiet place to stay away from the hustle and bustle, this is most certainly it. Beautifully decorated and surrounded by amazing views. This place had everything I needed for a few days away. Far enough out to provide peace and quiet but still close enough to hit up local attractions. Very clean."
10421,216,Great place great host great grocery store great hikes
10422,216,"We LOVED our stay at this Airbnb! From the tasteful decor inside to the beautiful outdoor spaces of the property, I promise you will not be disappointed. The house offers stunning views of the French Broad River and the surrounding mountains and our dog loved running in their well maintained grass area. The location of the home is also perfect for those seeking some outdoor adventures! We did some hiking along the Laurel River, rafted the French Broad, and enjoyed our evenings in Hot Springs. We gave this Airbnb a 10/10 and can't wait to come back again!"
10423,216,"A Madison County Gem! Charles’ place is a very clean and comfortable private home with magnificent mountain and river views, but close to Marshall and many hiking trails. We had no trouble navigating the hill but suggest daylight arrival. Highly recommend!"
10424,216,"This house is a gem. It has all the amenities we needed for a week plus stay with 2 dogs, 2 humans. The bed is extremely comfortable. The house itself was very clean. And the rural location cannot be beat with the river view. It's close enough to downtown Marshall and Asheville that we went everyday to visit local restaurants, breweries, and shops. There's also a small walking trail at the French Broad River access point close to the house. Highly recommend if you're wanting a quiet, rural getaway with easy access to Asheville."
10425,216,"Super clean, comfortable, quiet and spectacular views. Driveway was no problem for my subaru impreza. Perfect getaway."
10426,216,.
10427,216,We love it !! It was amazing!! Very nice and very clean !! The view was incredible.
10428,216,Great secluded getaway for a couple that was well furnished.
10429,216,Beautiful and clean. Very well appointed. Great hiking nearby.
10430,216,"Awesome place for a couple or a small family. Clean and all the necessities you would need. We loved the hammock and just lying around in the backyard. The drive up can be a bit challenging for novice drivers, but most cars should be able to handle it. House is pretty and perfect."
10431,216,Charles is an awesome host! We absolutely loved staying here. It’s close enough to Asheville to visit but just far enough for some nice relaxation. It’s a beautiful home…so quaint and homey.
10432,216,Beautiful home and view. Host was very responsive in communication. The location was a little off the beaten path but gave us the quiet we were looking for.
10433,216,This is a great mountain getaway! Charles is great!
10434,216,We loved our stay. Everything was perfect! Can’t wait to come back when it’s a little warmer :)
10435,216,Place was great! Well kept and nicely decorated.
10436,216,Very beautiful area !
10437,216,Great place to stay especially if you want to be in the mountains!
10438,216,We loved staying here in the peace and quiet! Charles was a wonderful host and we would recommend his property to our friends and family!
10439,216,"This is a fantastic place to stay! Gorgeous views, immaculate, spacious and cozy living spaces. It’s just the right distance from Asheville to be close to the action but still have a cabin in the woods experience. Beautifully crafted and decorated home with all the amenities and supplies you need. Hikes galore in this region. The stars are INCREDIBLE at night! Excellent host communication and amounts of information provided. Highly recommend!!"
10440,216,Beautiful home!
10441,216,"Great private spot, John was very responsive and the house is a hidden gem. The neighbors were quiet and didn’t bother anyone, the drive was a little rocky but nothing most all vehicles can handle. The place was clean, well equipped and they even left out some snacks and waters in the fridge. If you’re looking for a spot that’s away from everyone but still close enough to Asheville and everything else this is the place."
10442,216,This is everything that is advertised and so much more! The hosts are amazing and care about their guests! The view and decor is the best I have seen. The bed has made us decide to buy a dream cloud mattress. The linens are top notch. We will definitely come back and highly recommend this experience!!!
10443,216,"Beautiful escape, quiet and lovely furnishings. The bed is super soft (we prefer a firm mattress) but could tell it was high quality. Chilly but expected in Jan."
10444,216,Fantastic place. We wanted a quiet place to retreat from Covid and this was it. Close enough to enjoy food in Asheville. Would stay again
10445,216,Lovely home! Was very secluded and perfect for the vibe we were looking for a quiet weekend away! Would recommend 4WD for sure ☺️
10446,216,This home is a gem! The views were awesome and the house offered a nice place to escape and relax. The drive up the mountain is on a gravel road so be sure your car can handle a (steepish) climb on a potentially slippery surface. Hope to visit here again!
10447,216,"TL;DR
Highly recommend this property. My wife and I stayed here over Christmas this year with our dogs and loved it. Charles and John were super responsive to every inquiry we had. Snacks were available when we got there as previously mentioned which was super nice! We'd love to book a trip in the summer to see what it's like. Some previous reviews mentioned that the road to the house is a challenge, but we were able to make it in dry conditions in a Hyundai Sonata without any issues. At one point while driving to the house, some neighbors were trimming brush to widen the road, so we stopped and chatted. Enjoyed the conversation and got friendly southern waves from them each time we saw them after.

Property:
Absolutely amazing - I'd say better than advertised. Both daytime and nighttime offer spectacular views. Our favorite was going out in the afternoon and seeing both the hills all around us and watching (and listening) to the river below.

Interior:
If you look closely at the pictures you can tell it's got a bit of an industrial touch. Even if that's not ""your thing"", you likely won't notice because it's furnished nicely. I can't state enough... the garage is massive. We spent a lot of time in there with our dogs.

Location:
Definitely off the beaten path, which is absolutely what we wanted. It is about an hour to the Biltmore House and 30-40 minutes to Asheville. Marshall has a decent amount of restaurants and shops to keep you busy if you're looking to have a low key trip.

Misc:
If you visit during deer season, don't be surprised if you hear gunshots now and then. You're in the country :-)

Tips for future visitors:
- The key box on the door can be removed once it's unlocked. Do it, or you'll have trouble shutting the door.
- The Heat/AC remote control has a slide cover that exposes a lot more buttons. Took us 2 days to realize this, but we were much more comfortable once we did.
- There's no dishwasher. Take this as you will :-)"
10448,216,We had an amazing time. Off the beaten path and perfect for unwinding. Spotless and adorable! Charles had snacks and a few groceries when we got there! Thank goodness as it was late and everything was closed! Awesome communication and something we would definitely do again!
10449,216,"This airbnb was impeccable in cleanliness, decoration + views. Located next to the French Broad River, it was the perfect little getaway in the mountains with a very short drive to nearby Asheville. We loved how spacious and fully equipped it was as well as the attentiveness the host gave when we needed to communicate. One thing I'd point out to future guests is to be sure you don't have a lowered car as the private road up the mountain to the actual house is more on the rocky side and it could become intimidating if you're not an experienced driver. Would book with this host again :)"
10450,216,"First time visiting Marshall, NC! Downtown Marshall is charming! And Airbnb was the perfect getaway with our pups! Private hilltop with great views! Less than 30 min to Asheville!"
10451,216,Such an amazing site to stay at in the mountains. Plenty of great experiences near by but also lovely to stay in and have a fire out back. Will definitely be staying again!
10452,222,"This cabin was exactly what I needed. I want it to get away for a refreshing break, and this cabin did it all for me. The cabin itself is so clean and so cozy and everything you needed to be comfortable. Definitely not your average cabin. The fire pit and hot tub is a huge bonus. Avery already had the hot tub on, it made it so easy to enjoy the evening. Very peaceful and quiet at night sitting on the back porch. I enjoyed the rocking chair on the front porch in the morning. I definitely cannot wait to come back."
10453,222,This home was absolutely wonderful. Clean and well kept. The beds and pillows were very comfortable. The weather was perfect to sit by the fire and hang out in the hot tub. Looking forward to booking another stay here in the future!
10454,222,Loved this place. Everything was great. thoughtfully furnished and supplied. Peaceful retreat. The beds were so comfy!
10455,222,"This is a GREAT comfortable, cozy-yet-not small cabin, private and awesome.
All the amenities and small touches. A great location, very peaceful."
10456,222,"This cabin is in a beautiful, peaceful setting out in the country. We had a great stay--the hot tub was wonderful, the fire pit was ready and easy to use, the record player and provided record added a nostalgic element, and the cabin was stocked with exactly what we needed for a wonderful two-night stay. We drove to Homestead Steakhouse for dinner one night, and we also ate at Flat River Cafe, both nearby. Lots of local flare, unique experience, would love to come back!"
10457,222,"Avery's place was absolutely a dream for our little weekend away in the woods. It's so nicely decorated yet so cozy. The beds were super comfortable, the hot tub was MAGIC, and the house just has everything you need plus so many nice little touches including the s'mores kit. Would highly recommend. Thank you Avery for a lovely stay!"
10458,222,What a find for an unexpected work trip! So much nicer than any extended stay hotel and in a serene and easy to access location. Clean and well kept inside and out. The hot tub by the fire pit sealed the deal!! Thank you so much Avery! Very nice job on your place 👏
10459,222,The space was as advertised. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a quiet house away from the city.
10460,222,"Perfect spot to get away and relax! It was easy to find but secluded. It’s not too far from Danville and Durham. The drive to both of those towns was beautiful and scenic. Everything was in top condition in the cabin and Avery was a great host. The hot tub was great, best hot tub I’ve ever been in! The fire pit was great to sit around too. Thank you!!!! I can’t wait to come back again and maybe check out the winery down the street."
10461,227,We really enjoyed our stay at the cabin. It was so peaceful. Will definitely visit again.
10462,227,My husband and I greatly enjoyed our time at the Grove. It was a relaxing place to spend a long weekend with our dog. We would certainly return!
10463,227,Always a good time staying at the grove!
10464,227,"I cannot recommend The Grove enough! It’s a gorgeous little cabin truly tucked away in rolling hills. Service is iffy which makes it a great spot to be off the grid. We brought 2 dogs and wandering the trails mowed in the property with them was wonderful.

The wood stove is great, but electric heat also available if you don’t want to deal with building and maintaining fires.

Overall a wonderful weekend and will definitely look at visiting again for different seasons."
10465,227,So glad you enjoyed the getaway...Verizon is the main carrier with decent service...definitely spotty otherwise. Come back and see us!
10466,227,Wonderful get away! Can’t wait to go back
10467,227,"Sounds good, thanks for staying."
10468,227,"The Grove was an incredibly fun place to stay. It was hard to tell who had more fun, us or our dog. Cute and clean cabin with beautiful surroundings and peacefulness. We will definitely be back again!"
10469,227,Dog heaven...a wildlife Sniffari for sure!
10470,227,"If there was a way to say something bad so that other people would stay away, I would because this place is THAT much of a gem--but I couldn't do that to Scott. This place is absolutely SERENE. No TV and no wifi (or at least I told myself no wifi) and the weekend was fabulous. Brought my two chihuahuas and we just chilled. The fireplace--wonderful. I felt like I was in a Laura Ingalls Wilder novel. Scott is the bomb and his entire cabin is an art gallery. Makes you rethink your priorities, reset, and get in touch with nature. I think if Walt Whitman were alive, he'd be at Scott's cabin every weekend."
10471,227,"Super sweet and SO glad you could unplug (and you're right, there is no wifi on purpose)...come back and see us!"
10472,227,Incredible secluded cabin! I've stayed here multiple times because it's amazing and peaceful. There are no other people or houses around - just hills and trees to explore. I usually see deer at some point. Heard an owl this time. There are a lot of nice touches around the cabin. The dogs love it too. Highly recommended!
10473,227,"Glad you all enjoyed it, yes, lots of birds, people have seen eagles down by the river as well...come back and see us!"
10474,227,"The perfect weekend getaway for my husband and me. Our dogs also enjoyed exploring the trails with us.
We will definitely be back!"
10475,227,"So glad you enjoyed your stay and yes, there’s lots of sights and smells for the fur babies!"
10476,227,"What a wonderful spot! Scott’s place is beautiful, well stocked, and private. He is extremely responsive and understanding and helpful. Would love to return!"
10477,227,And maybe a little skiff of snow too! Winter window dressing...the Grove has a different personality in all seasons...definitely come back and see us and explore more!
10478,227,"As usual the Grove was amazing. Peaceful, serene and a place to unplug and recharge. We will be back."
10479,227,"Always happy to share the tranquility of that space, glad you enjoyed it!"
10480,227,This was our fourrh day at the Grove and I must say we have a such wonderful time every time we visit. Peace and calmness just what was needed to bring in the New Year. Until the next time.. thanks Scott.
10481,227,"That is sweet, so glad...yes, until next time!"
10482,227,"This was our 3rd stay at The Grove, its our favorite place! The time passes slower and its peaceful. We are always sad when the trip is over, but leave feeling rested."
10483,227,"I hope that you all were warm and snug during the extreme cold that we endured, come back and see us anytime"
10484,227,"This was my second time visiting the Grove and it was as exactly how I remembered it. It’s beautiful and the cabin has everything you need. I brought my family this time and they had lots of fun, we enjoyed walks around the property and stayed warm using the wood stove! If you have the time to check out Grayson Highlands State Park, we hiked some trails including a small portion of the Appalachian Trail. We look forward to coming back again!"
10485,227,"Glad you could share the Grove! It was a foggy, misty, mysterious stretch of days...hope you can come back in the sunshine!"
10486,227,"We love Scott’s cabin and have stayed here multiple years in a row. The place is cozy and the claw foot bathtub is to die for. Thank you for a great place, Scott!"
10487,227,Glad that you have found The Grove and made it a tradition!
10488,227,"I see why this place is booked solid most of the time. It's a great choice! You get the quiet beauty of the mountains with privacy and some land to explore, with the comforts of home- heat and air, a bathroom with shower and tub, plus a bed and kitchen.

Make sure you download the map and instructions Scott sends you. I did not have service at the gate, but I am honestly disappointed that I did have enough service to send and receive texts in the cabin (AT&T).

The kitchen was stocked beyond my expectations. I had brought butter and ketchup but apparently did not need it. The previous guests even left a cookie cake and a bottle of wine.

Only negatives- The pictures are a little dated, so there was no TV/DVD/VCR as pictured (wasn't looking for one anyway). There were no smoke detectors on the ceiling mounts. And it's obviously a place for pet lovers; I ended up with pet hair on my clothes from the furniture.

Definitely was the peaceful place I needed, and I would definitely come back again!"
10489,227,"Hey Caleb, thanks for the extensive review, sorry about the older photo showing the TV, I've removed that and the amenities don't list it...I am glad you had some cell coverage, Verizon service is better at the cabin...we'll double check the smoke alarms, I know there is one above the fridge (but not on the ceiling) and as for pet hair, yes folks love their fur babies and we do vacuum the furniture, so that's a tough one! Come back and see us, The Grove has a different personality in all four seasons!"
10490,227,"Seemed too good to be true. Really glad it was as great as everyone says. Cabin is comfortable and cozy, has everything you need. You can’t beat the setting, it’s so beautiful-and so quiet!"
10491,227,What a sweet sentiment...so glad you were able to enjoy your stay!
10492,227,Always enjoy Scott’s place! It does indeed have a different character each season! Thanks for sharing it with others.
10493,227,Always welcome!
10494,227,"Wonderful property with great room for dogs to run safely. Quiet and private.
A perfect, simple getaway to unwind and close enough to West Jefferson if you want to run into town."
10495,227,"It is dog heaven, lots of sights, sounds and smells of the wide open and the woods...come back and see us!"
10496,227,"The Grove was so nice to come back to and relax after a big day of hiking. We enjoyed the fire pit for an evening and Scott had plenty of Firewood. We enjoyed the groomed trails on property and stargazing. I was impressed that everything was stocked. If you forgot something, The Grove has it! The nice guests before us left us a jar of local raspberry jam...so nice!
I would come back here if in the area hiking again."
10497,227,Hope you can...the Pay It Forward guest gift program is a special amenity from guest to guest...(I wish it was my idea to begin with!).
10498,227,"if i ever run away from home, this is where they'll find me!"
10499,227,Duly noted! We do hope you return whenever you can...
10500,227,"Secluded, beautiful property! Right by a gorgeous section of the New River. We loved having a fire and having a weekend to unwind. Would definitely stay here again."
10501,227,Something about sitting by a fire pit...we've been doing that for millennia and it still is enjoyable! Come back and see us!
10502,227,Perfect place to enjoy nature and the Grayson highlands state park.
10503,227,Nearby Grayson Highlands is a wonderful addition to the Grove experience...come back and see us!
10504,227,"Always a wonderful stay at the Grove. Scott is such a great host and makes sure the house is spotless! He’s got most every cooking utensil you should need. The views are endless, the relaxation is inevitable, and the memories are abundant! You’ll be planning your next stay before you leave, trust me! The Grove is a blessing and we will be back again and again!"
10505,227,"Thanks for your kind words and for participating in the Guest Pay it Forward program, it's always a cool treat to find the notes and goodies the previous guests have left behind for you..."
10506,227,"We had such a great time staying at the Grove- my German Shepherd didn't want to leave.. Scott is a wonderful and attentive host, quick and easy to communicate with. The cabin had everything needed for a restful stay after a long hiking day at Grayson Highlands and thoughtfully planned and marked paths around the property provided even more opportunities to spend time outdoors enjoying the beautiful nature surrounding the cabin. The Grove is truly a very special place and we hope to return soon."
10507,227,"Glad you enjoyed your stay, welcome back anytime!"
10508,227,"The Grove is the perfect place to get away from it all. Wildlife is abundant, trails are manicured, and cabin is cozy and clean. We will be back soon. Thanks Scott."
10509,227,"You are most welcome, definitely come back and see us..."
10510,227,A stay at The Grove is an absolute must if your looking to get away from the everyday stresses of life and reconnect with the appreciation of pure serenity and the beautiful sounds of nature.
10511,227,So glad you enjoyed your stay!
10512,227,The Grove is a wonderful place to stay! This was our second visit and we love the peacefulness and the privacy!
10513,227,We love how the Grove has become a tradition for so many to share!
10514,227,We enjoyed another wonderful stay at Scott’s little slice of heaven! Thanks so much for having us. Can’t wait for our next visit to our favorite corner of NC.
10515,227,"Sounds like a plan, come back and see us anytime!"
10516,227,We loved our stay here and would come back! The location is secluded and we felt like we had the whole area to ourselves. Host was kind and responsive when we had questions
10517,227,"So glad, The Grove has a different personality in all 4 seasons...come back and see us!"
10518,227,Beautiful place...so peaceful and just amazing
10519,227,Come back and see us anytime!
10520,227,"The Gove was definitely magical. I woke up to deer feeding in the meadow every morning, watching the raccoons eat apples in the apple tree, enjoyed the walks across the property and danced in the rain. If you want to be in the middle of nature without the sound of busy life, then this is the place. Surrounded by trees, the sound of the wind, and just pure peace was the exact prescription I needed. Thank you."
10521,227,So glad you were able to recharge your batteries and enjoy your stay!
10522,227,"Another wonderful stay at The Grove! Hikes along the trails, bike rides by the river, stargazing, s’mores and morning deer visits created many magical moments that will always be treasured.
Scott is an exceptional host and The Grove is our favorite cabin in the mountains . It is truly a spectacular experience staying at The Grove !!!"
10523,227,You and Teresa are always welcome!
10524,227,The entire property was magical! We throughly enjoyed every minute of our stay. Coming in on the gravel rd set the tone of the stay. You just knew it was going to be secluded and a space for disconnecting. Our children and four legged children loved the space too. I would definitely recommend this gem of a place!
10525,227,"That is sweet! So glad you enjoyed it, come back anytime!"
10526,227,Peaceful location with plenty of fun activities in the area!
10527,227,"There is plenty to do and explore, come back and see us!"
10528,227,This was my second stay. It was just as pleasant as the first. I hope you be able to come again!
10529,227,I hope so too!
10530,227,"There’s nothing like the feeling of being in a cabin on 18 acres of private land in such gorgeous country!
Scott is very attentive & we’ve already booked another stay for the autumn!"
10531,227,Wonderful...I know those oaks on the ridge will still be colorful when you get back up to The Grove!
10532,227,My fiance and I had a great weekend getaway with our doggies. The cabin feels more roomy than what the pictures seemed and the house is definitely secluded and is so relaxing. We loved the artwork done around the house done by scott and we purchased a beautiful piece for ourselves! We are already talking about wanting to come back in the different seasons to see the changes of the trees and fields.
10533,227,"So glad you enjoyed it, and that you have some original art! Come back and see us anytime!"
10534,227,"Grove Cabin is a lovely, magical place - quiet, beautiful and close to many hiking opportunities. My husband and I have stayed there frequently, and always wish for more."
10535,227,"You'll always have a home at The Grove, come back and see us anytime!"
10536,227,"Such a beautiful place, so wonderful!"
10537,227,Come back and see us!
10538,227,"This adorable cabin offered everything we needed for a perfect mountain get-a-away. The best way to describe the cabin is clean, cozy with everything you need to enjoy your time in the mountains. The kitchen was stocked with all you need as far as cookware and bakeware to make your meals in the cabin. The gas stove and oven worked very well. The view from every window in the cabin is beautiful!! Eating meals on the picnic table is highly recommended! Needless to say, it is our plan to make a return visit to this cabin. Each season would be ideal!!!"
10539,227,Definitely come back up and visit whenever you can!
10540,227,"Great mountain cabin that offers peace, quiet and solitude. Wildlife is abundant morning and evenings. Neighbors are far away but really nice when you see them."
10541,227,"Glad you enjoyed your stay, there is/was a turkey hen on a nest just below the cabin so there will be many Jakes and Jennys roaming around soon! Come back and see us!"
10542,227,The Grove is a special place. It’s a beautiful property with a fascinating history. I highly recommend this place if you’re looking to commune with nature. I loved exploring the property on all the mowed out trails with my dog. I found the beds and furniture to be pretty comfortable. Scott was a responsive host.
10543,227,"Glad you had a good visit, come back and see us!"
10544,227,"Everything was even better than expected. The cabin was great,clean and very accomodating. The views and the walks around the meadow are priceless. I had the best time. At night while out taking pictures of the stars I was hearing barred owls from many directions such a cool and exciting experience"
10545,227,"So glad you enjoyed your stay and yes, with no city or street lights, the night sky is expansive and impressive!"
10546,227,We just got back from our second trip to the grove. We had a perfect weekend and feel recharged.
10547,227,I am so pleased to hear that! The Grove can do that! Come back and see us!
10548,227,We had yet another magical stay at The Grove! The weather was absolutely gorgeous for the entirety of our stay and we spent a lot of our time outside. We had lots of fun using a plant guide to identify the wide array of flora on the property. The Grove is the perfect place to relax and unwind and we are always so thankful for our time here!
10549,227,What a perfect gift the plant guide will be to future guests to help them identify all the goodness growing at the Grove...thank you! Glad you had a great stay!
10550,227,"Beautiful, secluded, amazing place to stay. Scott was wonderful host!!!!! ty so very much!!!!!!! wished couldhave stayed longer!!!!!"
10551,227,Come on back and see us!
10552,227,"Scott has a beautiful property that’s remote enough for privacy but close enough to small towns or larger hiking areas that you have plenty of options.

There’s a great feeling to the home and grounds with plenty of personal touches.

We’ll definitely return and would highly recommend!"
10553,227,Glad you got to let the pups run and see the daffodils hand the spotlight over to the Forsythia! Come back and see us!
10554,227,"I was looking for a getaway from the beach and The Grove gave me just that! Scott is an amazing host, he stays in touch for any questions or suggestions. There’s plenty of trails to explore on the property and you won’t feel the need to leave once you’re there. If you do decide to explore the surrounding area, I visited the Grayson Highlands State Park and was not disappointed. I hiked with my pup and saw the wild horses. It’s definitely a special place, and I look forward to returning!"
10555,227,"We love Grayson Highlands! Glad you enjoyed your stay, come back and see us!"
10556,241,This place was excellent! Very good for my husband and I along with our child. There was a nice yard for my kid to run around and get her energy out. Quiet neighborhood and easy access to shopping and FOOD!
10557,241,Great stay! You can tell Mark takes pride in his property and the service he provides.
10558,241,Mark has done a wonderful job rebuilding and redecorating his bungalow! We loved our stay and enjoyed all of the amenities! We highly recommend his Airbnb if you need a place to stay in the region! Mark is a super host!
10559,241,"We arrived later than expected due to heavy traffic leaving FL. Mark's home was very comfortable and we wished arrived earlier to enjoy it. The bed was AWESOME! After a long day driving, my head hit the pillow and I slept through the night. It was SO comfortable! I went to text Mark the next morning asking if we could check out at 11:00 instead of 10:00 and found a message from Mark offering a late check out since we arrived so late. That was so thoughtful of him, and we took him up on his offer! We may return to take advantage of the breweries, antique stores and historic sites in the area. Highly recommend Mark's beautiful home! He is the perfect host!"
10560,241,Absolutely beautiful place & great location!
10561,241,"Mr. Mark was a phenomenal host, a beautiful home and the layout is goregous better than the pictures! every detail of this home was wonderfully executed, Mr. Mark you are an outstanding host and every time we are in your area i will definitely stay in your place if it’s available!❤️❤️❤️❤️"
10562,241,Right when we walked in it felt like we were at home! We had 4 people in the house and there was plenty of room. The bathroom was amazing!!
10563,241,"Mark was an amazing host, and had the most peaceful spot, and beautiful place! We loved spending our mornings on the screened in front porch!

10566,241,Mark's place was amazing. It was just as described and made us feel right at home. Mark is such a great host.
10567,241,"Mark pulled out all the stops with this space. The bathroom is immaculate, all the added features made for a nice experience. Super comfortable couches and the king bed was like a cloud. The front porch was the highlight of my stay. The rain on the tin roof combined with the heater Mark installed made for a relaxing stay. Will definitely come back and stay for more than a day. The headboard even had usb connections to charge your devices. One of the best airbnbs I’ve stayed at."
10568,241,Super nice place very comfortable just a few min fro outlet store and food
10569,241,"We had a great stay at Mark’s place. It was just as described, and we hope to stay again when we’re in the area."
10570,241,"Mark is truly a super host! His
place is perfectly clean, comfortable, and conveniently located a few minutes
(about a mile) From 95.
I would recommend this cottage and will return."
10571,241,Looks just like the pictures!! Super homey and quiet. Would definitely come back!!
10572,241,Mark's place was by far one of the nicest airbnbs I've stayed at over the years.
10573,241,A+ stay!!
10574,241,The best airbnb host I have ever had. I will forever come back to North Carolina because of his hospitality and stay at this location
10575,241,"Perfect place. Very quiet and private, but only a 5-10 minute drive from town. The beds were very comfortable and everything was just as pictured. Will definitely stay again if in the area."
10576,241,5 star spot. Everything you need. Really clean and tidy. Beds really comfortable
10577,241,"Nice property, thoughtful upgrades, responsive host, listing as advertised, would stay again."
10578,241,Everything as pictured if not better!

10580,241,This place is definitely a jaw dropper very nice and love how it's decorated Pictures online are exactly what it looks like!! Its very cozy fully loaded home away from home. Would definitely recommend this place!! The host Mark was very helpful responsed back right away when needed! Thank you for opening up this home and letting us make great 2023 New Year memories !! We will Definitely be back soon!
10581,241,The whole house is exactly like photos shown. It was very beautiful and clean! The work inside that has been done is amazing! Would definitely stay again if I was in the Smithfield area.
10582,241,Place was amazing.. Perfect place to stay for our trip. Mark was the perfect host.. Highly recommend.
10583,241,Loved the place ! Perfect for a nice getaway and very peaceful! Will definitely try to get out there again for a another stay ! Mark was VERRY helpful and informative and the decor was amazing along with the entertainment equipment such as the surround sound speakers and the TVs in each room ! The bedrooms were extremely comfortable! 10/10 will stay again!
10584,241,Great comfortable stay with convenient location. Airbnb was clean with an honest and responsive host.
10585,241,"From the second I walked in I felt relaxed! Absolutely beautifully decorated, modern, with high end appliances.Everthing was perfect. I was only in town for one night on business and did not want to leave in the morning! Exceptional Stay and an amazing host. Could not ask for more!"
10586,241,"Cozy blankets, a beautiful barnwood wall, plenty of plug-ins, and plenty of tide pods with the laundry facilities! Everything was very clean and the walk in shower was great!"
10587,241,beautiful home! very modern and quiet. definitely will stay here again.
10588,241,Great place to stay!
10589,241,"Everything was great! The house was immaculate and everything in it was new, clean and comfortable. The best place we have stayed at so far!"
10590,241,Mark was super helpful and didn’t leave a single detail out! The level of thought put into making guests comfortable was excellent! Lovely get away and will be staying again!
10591,241,"Great home, with a great host. Loved the stay and the way everything looked and worked out. The porch with the screen netting was beautiful!! Great communication as well."
10592,241,"The place was hands down beautiful, decorating top tier and the beds were so comfortab I did not want to get up the next morning.... anyway the place is a 12/10 I would come again for sure"
10593,241,This was a great find! Super clean and everything was brand new. All of the appliances and fixtures are top quality. It exceeded all expectations. By far the nicest place I have ever stayed at through airbnb! I cannot believe the price of the place based on how nice of a home it was.
10594,241,We had a death In my wife's family and she had to drive to Wilmington. As a result of previous plans we had to make alternative plans for Thanksgiving which included me driving my daughter's down to spend one night together with my wife and children at mark's place. Mark was kind enough to allow us access early which gave my wife time to do laundry since she didn't have enough clothes for her original trip. This was a great blessing during a difficult time. The house was beautiful the beds were very comfortable. Even though we only stayed one night I was glad I could at least spend 1 night with my wife and children before they had to head back down to Wilmington for the funeral services. I had to come back home to take care of our special needs son and the farm. I'm greatly appreciative of the kindness they showed in giving us early access due to our situation.
10595,241,Mark was great! Communicative and flexible.
10596,241,We enjoyed our stay for one night. It's such a cute house and it looks just like the pictures. Very clean and cozy. We wish we could have stayed longer. The bed is so comfortable. We will definitely stay again..
10597,241,"What a wonderful home you’ve created to share! The amenities, fixtures, and finishes are top notch. The beds are comfy,; the tv/sound system is fabulous; and anything you could need is provided! It’s only a 5-10 drive to anywhere you would like to eat or shop. Thank you again, Mark - you are a great host!!"
10598,241,"Beautiful, Quiet, Clean Nd Relaxing spot. Really enjoyed the sreened front porch with heat and air. Best Air BNB I've stayed in thus far and I've stayed at many. Mark is a great host!!!"
10599,241,it was just absolutely beautiful
10600,241,mark was a great host clean place and very relaxing everything you need
10601,241,The most comfortable Airbnb you will ever stay in. This house was so perfect I couldn’t believe it. Everything you could want was in reach. The beds were so clean and comfortable. Every store and restaurant was 5-10 mins away. Great Job Mark!! You Did It With This One!!!!
10602,241,"We loved the place, a very comfortable place to spend a pleasant time"
10603,247,Very nice... The Jumping pillow was a great add on.
10604,247,"We really enjoyed our stay at Nonna's Nest treehouse. It was very clean and we all had a great night's sleep.
Definitely planning on a return visit"
10605,247,Wonderful stay! It rained the whole weekend but did not stop us from having a great time and enjoying the cozy cabin tree house vibes! We have already planned to stay again soon
10606,247,"What to say- Cherry Treesort was a fantastic springtime getaway! We stayed in Nona's Nest, which was perfect for a family of four! Another one or two on the couch would have made things cozy, but still doable. It was right by the bouncing pillow, too, which was fantastic for kids! The location was easy to find on GPS and was well marked, the house was even more adorable than pictured, and amenities were as described. The host communicated well and stay details were clear. For people who like to pick up food upon arrival (or forget meds), there is a Food Lion 5 minutes down the road- very convenient. To make things more interesting, we experienced a one-in-a-million freak power outage (to the whole town). The host communicated well throughout the outage, came around to check on visitors, provided water, and offered to pick up any other needed goods for people who wanted to stick around. It is very unlikely that this would happen, but the host responded well. Loved it- Thanks!"
10607,247,I would encourage my Cabarrus County friends and neighbors (and surrounding areas) to give serious consideration to stay at Cherry Treesort for a quiet peaceful reconnect with the outdoors for your family and visitors. You will enjoy more than ample accommodations in a convenient location and area rich with local and area resources to please every preference. We loved it!
10608,247,"A friend and I came from NY to Hickory to visit another friend of ours for a girl's trip. We came across Cherry Treesort through an ad. It looked fun and we thought we'd give it a try for a night. This stay went beyond our expectations. We Stayed in Nona's Nest and it was the perfect size for us. It has a roomy refrigerator for our snacks and a kuring with some great coffee choices. Outside there were hammocks, swingchairs and a fire pit. The wood for the fire pit is available for a small fee and well worth it ! And we also opted for the smores packs! They were put together perfectly! It was chilly outside, but the fire kept us warm, and we also had plenty of heat inside. Thank you Trent for providing such an amazing space to go and relax. We hope to visit again soon."
10609,247,"Fun family getaway! We were in town for my son’s mountain bike race. Unfortunately, the race got canceled. We made every moment count and can’t wait to book the next one!"
10610,247,"Great night at Nona’s Nest. We used the jump pillow, walking trails and fire pit! This place was exactly as described and would recommend."
10611,247,The Cherry Treesort is amazing! We will be back!!!
10612,247,Enjoyed our stay! Thanks!
10613,247,Loved this place. Hope to bring our older kids next time. Highly recommend. Bring food. Must cook on fire or in microwave. We just brought precooked meals from cracker barrel.
10614,247,"It was very relaxing and peaceful. The Nonas nest was very cozy. Only negative thing is we couldn't get but 2 channels on television and no sink in bathroom.

The price was good but the fees and taxes were more than expected and a bit high.

Everything else was perfect."
10615,247,"Our stay at Nona’s Nest was a happy accident. On a drive to WV from GA I decided my family of 5 (three young kids 11,8,4) needed a “layover” and made a last minute booking. It was the best decision ever for us. The jumping pillow was a life safer for cooped up kids, as was the creek behind the treehouse and the swings. The weather cooperated beautifully which really pushed this stay into “magical” territory for me. Rural/Remoteness makes my husband uneasy, but this was a perfect balance for us. It is remote, but didn’t feel unsafe. It was private, but not so private that you felt alone in the wilderness. The treesort is laid out thoughtfully. The treehouses are as well. Plenty of outlets, fully functioning, clean bathroom IN A TREEHOUSE, I didn’t detect any shifting in the wind, it was stable. I’m gonna just say it - I think I had one of my most calming, serene, happy days of my life there. Reading in a swing near a creek under a treehouse with a campfire - it was bliss."
10616,247,"Great stay, always lovely to stay here. The jump pillow was a great addition"
10617,247,Such a cool place I’d recommend this to anyone!
10618,247,Fun weekend get away with the family.
10619,247,"We had a great time in Nona’s Nest. It fit 5 of us comfortably, between the queen bed, 2 bunks and pull out couch. The kids (and us) absolutely loved staying in a treehouse. It was a cold weekend, but we still got use of the jump pad, the swings under the treehouse and the fire pit. We loved it so much, we booked our next stay before we even left!"
10620,247,Me and my family stayed at Nona’s Nest. It was exactly what I expected…perfect for a weekend getaway. I’m excited to come back but this time is like the rest of my family to rent other treehouses around us.
10621,247,"We were expecting an experience like camping in the forest, but in a tree house with basic amenities. The house was novel, but didn't have anywhere to eat or play games. There was seating and stuff to do outside when the weather was nice. But if it's raining, you're out of luck and have to go in town for dinner; about 5 minutes away.. which wasn't very ""camp"" like. As long as the weather is nice, it'd be a neat escape for a night or two. Since the tree houses are pretty close to each other, it could be a blast to rent out a couple for an extended family vacation. But it's not exactly camping in the forest in a secluded tree house."
10622,247,We had a lovely stay in the trees! Everything you need to have a great time has been thought about by your hosts. We have already recommended this place to several friends. Thank you for a wonderful stay.
10623,247,Great place to stay with kids and scenic with mountains. We were there during a winter storm and it was freezing but nothing that was in his control. We will be back!
10624,247,"Nona’s Nest was an excellent clamping option - the kids LOVED their bunk beds, and looking out the windows from their treehouse. Very clean, the host was responsive, and the outdoor amenities were so cute. Highly recommend!"
10625,247,"We had such a great experience staying at the Cherry Treesort! It definitely exceeded our expectations. Our grandchildren thought it was the coolest and the bounce pad was an added bonus!
We can’t wait to go back!!"
10626,247,What a great place to stay! My boys loved it!
10627,247,Good experience will visit again.
10628,247,"My grandsons, 9 &5, thought I was kidding when I told them we were going to stay in a treehouse. They were so surprised and excited when we arrived at Nona’s Nest and realized it was true! The Christmas lights and Christmas trees on all of the treehouses made the farm look magical when we arrived! We had plans in the area (riding the Polar Express at the NC Transportation Museum and visiting Lazy 5 Ranch) so the location was perfect. We enjoyed exploring the grounds, and the boys got a lot of energy out on the Jump Pillow! We arrived late and had evening plans our second night, so we didn’t have a chance to use the firepit, but we did buy Molly’s S’mores kits that were conveniently left for us in the fridge. We found lots of things to do and good places to eat, but I think we could have easily just stayed right there and been perfectly content! Everything is very well done! We’re already making plans for our next visit! Why stay in a boring hotel when you can sleep in a treehouse?"
10629,247,Kids loved it! Cool place.
10630,247,Staying at Trent’s Treesort in Nona’s Nest was a unique and wonderful experience! We highly recommend it!
10631,247,Very fun for my kids - spent a fair amount of time on the jump pad and staring out the windows of their bunk beds. A short but great getaway for my family of four
10632,247,This was hands down one of the coolest places we have ever stayed. We had 4 tree-houses for a combo birthday party and the kids and adults couldn't have imagined a better place! Everything about it was great!! I would give 10 stars if i could!
10633,247,"We enjoyed our stay, It definitely could be a girls weekend thing… the grandsons loved the outdoors space…next time we want to be able to stay a few nights."
10634,247,Great spot for a vacation or overnight stay!
10635,247,We really enjoyed our stay at the treehouse! We enjoyed the swings and fire pit. The kids had a blast roasting marshmallows and playing on the jumping pillow! Be sure to bring essentials- including trash bags and paper towels! It’s also a good idea to bring a headlamp and lantern as it can be hard to see your way down the hill to the fire pit. We had a great trip and definitely recommend Nona’s Nest!
10636,247,First time “glamping” and enjoyed the experience of staying in a treehouse!
10637,247,"I surprised my 3 young nieces with an overnight stay at Nonas nest and it did not disappoint! They loved everything about the tree house/property, the swings under the house, the fire pit, the jumping pillow.. the bunk beds! We had the best time. Can’t wait to visit again!"
10638,247,"Our stay was very pleasant. The tree house and property surpassed our expectations. The bounce pad was one of the kids favorites. Nice fire pit, swings, and enough amenities to make it a comfortable stay. Trent was very responsive and check in was easy. Thank you for giving us a wonderful experience."
10639,247,This is a great hidden gem. This is our second time staying here and our kids are already talking about the next treehouse they want to stay in. The grounds are amazing to walk around and enjoy. The bounce pillow is an excellent addition to the property.
10640,247,"Right in the middle of downtown, and the nights were actually still nice and quiet in our room. Beautiful views out of the window."
10641,247,What a great idea for a stay - we made this reservation to celebrate our 24 yr anniversary. Trent was great to work with.
10642,247,Wonderful family time! Everything you need! Such a sweet place!
10643,247,Awesome location in China Grove. A fun place to stay for kids and adults.
10644,247,"Great family oriented place to get away from home, but enjoy the outdoors or some family game time. The jump pad is wonderful entertainment."
10645,247,Great set up. We had three families staying in different treehouses and we were able to move around the grounds and hang out together. The kids loved playing on the jump pillow.
10646,247,We had a great time staying here before taking our boys to the Transportation Museum. The bedroom has a barn door so you can get some amount of sound proofing from the bunk beds in the main area (always hard traveling with the kids and managing different bedtimes). Trent was a great host and we highly recommend the Cherry Treesort!
10647,247,We had such a wonderful stay at Nona’s Nest! The treehouse was so charming and very clean. We loved sitting on the large porch. It was a perfect fit for us with our two teenagers. And they didn’t pick their phones while we were there! The fire pit at this location is very private. The inflatable trampoline was a huge hit! We would absolutely recommend staying at Cherry Treesort!
10648,247,Great place to get away
10649,247,"Perfect getaway, such a unique property that is well maintained and cleaned. Relaxing and/or fun for everyone!"
10650,247,We had a great time! Can’t wait to go back!
10651,247,Very nice clean place to get away. A unique idea to stay in a treehouse. Very thoughtful and great communication! Highly recommended!
10652,247,"Sooo much fun and so close to Charlotte. This was our third time coming and each time we come, we invite more families to join us. Well done Trent and family. It’s evident how much time y’all invest in making Cherry Treesort a special place. The bouncy thing was super fun too! Beds are comfortable. Atmosphere excellent. Truly one of a kind place."
10653,247,"Trent is always a wonderful host with incredible tree houses! We loved our stay at Nona's Nest and easily made it our favorite thus far. It's warm, cozy, and designed well. There was enough space for the 2 families of 2 adults and 3 kids. We all slept well and were comfy. The bed is on the firmer side but, I found that I actually liked it. The addition of the jump pad is perfect! We've always loved our stay with kids but found that there wasn't a major fun attraction there. The kids always love the swings, hammocks, big Jenga, and nature exploration. But the jump pad was perfect! The kids got their energy out after the drive and wanted to jump before leaving too. We will definitely be back and appreciate Trent and his family for having such a great accommodation for families or friends. We appreciate the little touches that his children also provide."
10654,247,"This is a beautiful setting. The treehouse is very comfortable, and there is a lovely deck where you can eat outside. There are lots of amenities for kids - swings, hammock, and a fire pit where we cooked hot dogs and s'mores. Lots of high windows in the house to let in light, and you can see the tops of the trees and the sky. We enjoyed our stay very much!"
10655,247,This is such a great place . It’s clean and so neat looking . This is second time we have stayed at the Treesort . It’s such a great place to get away feels like you are mikes away from the busy world . Great place to unwind and slow down . We really enjoy staying here and will come back soon.
10656,247,Great place. Definitely will be recommending
10657,247,Wonderful experience
10658,247,Gorgeous treehouses in a very beautiful & peaceful setting! Our treehouse was well appointed & had a really lovely outdoor area with hammocks and chairs around a fire pit. Love the architecture of the houses!
10659,247,Disappointed that lights outside never came on as we could see the lights of other houses on all around us. Bunk beds not very comfortable but the bedroom bed was nice.
10660,247,Very nice!
10661,247,Great unique stay! It was a fun experience for all of us! Will come again! Thanks!
10662,247,"What a wonderful and fun place to take a family on an adventure! Our grandchildren, ages 3 and 4, had so much fun on their first camping experience. We spent afternoons exploring the woods, swinging in hammocks and swings, and relaxing on the deck. Evenings were spent around the fire pit making s’mores and having a weenie roast. The inside accommodations were clean and for the most part comfortable. The pullout bed in the couch is pretty typical for that type of bed: not the most comfortable, but the mattress is a good memory foam. The kitchen area is very small with some coffee cups and glasses but no reusable plates. Paper plates, styrofoam bowls, and plastic cutlery were provided. If you plan to eat any meals at the house, be prepared to bring your own utensils and only food that can be made in a microwave. This is up-scale camping but camping nevertheless. We would definitely recommend Nona’s Nest if you are looking for a unique camping experience!"
10663,247,We had a nice time even though it rained! Pull out couch was super uncomfortable but that was our only complaint.
10664,247,A wonderful place to unwind and relax. The fire pit area was perfect and our tree house was clean and cozy. I look forward to returning in the fall.
10665,247,"Perfect place to enjoy a little walk in the woods! Excellent fire pit!
Treehouse details were perfect for our stay."
10666,247,it was fantastic. 2nd time going back. such a fun experience!! kids LOVED it. we will be back in the fall!
10667,247,"Fun Adventure, what a cool place! We had so much fun!"
10668,247,"This is such a cool place. The treehouses are all so unique and interesting, and we liked just walking around and checking them out. Comfortable place. AC is a huge benefit on a summer weekend. The decks and balconies are great. Excellent fire pits too. On-site firewood is a perk. The kids were over the moon about the place and we loved it too. We’ll be back."
10669,247,fantastic!
10670,247,Perfect getaway for those looking to get away from the public and enjoy some outdoor relaxation.
10671,247,"Great place !!!! It was awesome. The family and I had a great time. Really quiet and relaxing. Outdoor swings, fire pit and grill."
10672,247,Our kiddos absolutely loved this place!
10673,247,Such a cool experience!!
10674,247,We really enjoyed our stay in Nona's Nest! The place was very clean. Great little getaway!
10675,247,"We enjoyed our time in the treehouse! We had some rainstorms during our stay, and the branches and leaves landing on the tin roof during the night due to the wind were dramatic. We liked the giant Jenga, fire pit, swings, and hammock. Overall it was a great, fun memory for our kids!"
10676,247,"I really wanted to like it here, but we only stayed one night of our three nights due to personal preferences. The place just needed a deep cleaning. It was musty inside and allergies started kicking in. Beds were uncomfortable. We are campers and I would’ve rather been camping in a tent. Party of 6 and 4 towels were given. We also could’ve done without loud construction going on with building other tree houses nearby. I waited a while to give this review and thought I would feel different but that didn’t happen."
10677,247,Our experience at Nona’s Nest was great! The hosts were very nice and we all had a great time. We will definitely be back and tell friends about it.
10678,247,"We stayed for 2 nights at the end of our 10 day road trip. It was nice for some down time after busy beaches. The kids liked the hammocks and swings and enjoyed playing Jenga.
The treehouse could use a deep cleaning. Also, the beds were super noisy and lacked comfort. The pillows were very thin. We were only given 4 towels for 6 people initially, but the cleaning lady was very helpful in getting us 2 more. A few paper plates and plastic ware were provided. It would have been handy to have some actual reusable dishes.
That being said, the owners were very nice and even showed us another treehouse.
If just looking for a laid back time in the woods, then check out Nona's Nest. It would probably be better fitted for a family of 4. Don't forget some fire starter and roasting sticks!"
10679,247,Trent was an awesome host. He was very easy to communicate with and very accommodating. The tree house was wonderful. My boys absolutely loved the fire pit and the outdoor area. We even met some very nice neighbors who were staying in the cabin next to us. Wonderful experience! I highly recommend.
10680,247,Fun place to stay.
10681,247,We had a wonder visit to the Cherry Treesort!! It was beautiful and wonder place to make family memories!!
10682,247,This was a great find! Our family really enjoyed staying here and will be back!
10683,247,Expect a great adventure. Cooking over a campfire. Time with family away from the internet enjoy the outdoors. Several attractions close enough for day trips
10684,247,Nona's Nest is one of several treehouses on the property. What the owners have created is nothing short of amazing. It was a wonderful experience and we will definitely be back.
10685,247,Stay was great.
10686,247,"If I could give this place more than 5 stars I would. Exactly as advertised, cute as can be, convenient to so many fun things. It was hard to leave to go do the activities we had planned because we were all having so much fun around the campfire, using the swings and just hanging out on the porch. We can't wait to come back."
10687,247,"Great experience, good communication, we plan to be back"
10688,247,Such a neat place to stay! We had lots of fun unplugged family time! The kids are already talking about our next visit.
10689,247,"Everything was clean and ready for us. Nona's Nest was so cute! I slept on the couch and was very comfortable. Everything was as described on the website. The only issue we encountered was a power outage, but that's nobody's fault. We would definitely stay here again!"
10690,247,Our treehouse was amazing. Very private and plenty of room for a family of four.
10691,247,"Outstanding. So worth it, amazing experience. I would do it all over again."
10692,247,Good place to get away with grandkids.
10693,247,"We stayed one night in Nona’s Nest, and had a great time in such a unique place. Small details were not overlooked, and that was much appreciated. We’ll be back for sure."
10694,259,Missy is very friendly and made the stay very comfortable. Just a kind lady that has plenty of personality. You’ll want for nothing. I’ll stay here again for sure.
10695,259,Thank you so much for choosing to stay with us. We are always happy to have you back.
10696,259,"Missy is a very hospitable hostess, and is exceptional in communication!"
10697,259,Wonderful private room. Stays very dark with the lights off so you'll get a good night's sleep. Desk is nice if you need a work station.
10698,259,It was a clean space and a pleasant stay
10699,259,Missy is an extraordinary host
10700,259,A very comfortable room.
10701,259,"It’s just like a little kids room.
No Tv and no fridge but it’s a nice decent place"
10702,259,"Marco, Bless your heart. I’m sorry that you didn’t see the pictures of my home when you booked you stay. The pictures are accurate of what I have and what is in my guests rooms. I give a detailed description so that guests know exactly what they can expect and can continue to look for a place that suits their taste if my home is not perfect for their stay. I’m sorry that you don’t consider the ex- large side by side refrigerator in the kitchen that was available for you to use or the 55 inch big screen tv in the living room with access to thousands of channels. I’m pretty sure I mentioned several times if you needed anything at all just let me know. I keep an extra TV in the kitchen for guest that want one in their room however most of the time my guests prefer to watch the larger TV in the living room. I stay in my room so my guests can enjoy the house and have as much privacy as possible. I think I plainly give an exact description of what I have to offer. I’m not a hotel, staying with me is like staying with family on vacation so no refrigerator in the bedroom."
10703,259,Great room for day sleepers. Cool and quiet. Would def book again!
10704,259,"Missy was a great host, very kind, great communication, and room was super clean and just as described - highly recommend!"
10705,259,"Missy is a phenomenal host! Incredibly accommodating and the absolute nicest person. I booked an extended stay at her place for a month while I started my new job and looked for more permanent housing in the area and Missy was the warmest welcome I could have asked for including fairly consistently offering me home cooked food and going as far to include me in a board game night with her and her son. The rooms are a little smaller with only a twin bed but have more than enough room for a queen air mattress on the floor if there's more than one guest and the residence has everything else you could need! I highly recommend staying here if you're in the area, everything in Hickory is generally less than 15 min away."
10706,259,Great hostess! It was a last minute stay and missy was wonderful.
10707,259,"the perfect spot.
I love it here, and will come back"
10708,259,Nice place good location
10709,259,"Missy’s home is quiet, clean and comfortable. She makes sure you feel at home and isn’t shy to strike up a conversation. She is the sweetest woman and an amazing host. I would recommend this room to anyone looking for a home away from home."
10710,259,The best place to stay in near to Hickory ☝🏽☝🏽
10711,259,Perfect again and just as described
10712,259,"Missy offers a great, homey experience. Her home is super comfortable and she is super nice!"
10713,259,Missy is a wonderful host with great communication.
10714,259,Thank you for your help with Koda. You’re the best.
10715,259,This host was very sincere and accommodating. Room was a lot like a fancy dorm room vibe with a much needed desk to plan my trip to Asheville & beyond. Shared bathroom was very contemporary and clean. will save this stay in my NC Roadtrip folder ! thanks Missy.
10716,259,"Had a great stay! Very comfortable, had everything my infant son and I needed! Peaceful neighborhood for our morning walks. :)"

10728,259,"This is a wonderful location. I was very happy since it was only about a 15 minute drive to the far side of Hickory where I need to be. The area that the house is it in is a very quiet and very pleasant neighborhood. I also like the fact it was only about a 10 minute drive off of I 40.
It really felt more like staying with a friend then like being in an Airbnb or even a hotel."
10729,259,I’m so glad you made it safely to your next stop. Places be safe driving and we hope to see you soon.
10730,259,"Missy is one of the sweetest ladies I've met, she made sure my stay was as comfortable as it could get."

10737,259,"Thank you, Jenny!"
10738,259,"This was my first experience with Air BNB. I could not be happier with Missy as a host. She was so kind and very quick to respond. The home was very clean.

And thankful as I was there for work and definitely needed the quiet and peace when I got off of work.
Looking forward to staying there again."
10759,259,"Thank you so much. Having great guests like you make this all worthwhile. Btw, I found a tan belt under the desk. I’ll save it for you."

Missy's place is ideal for the solo traveler. The private bedroom has a single bed is comfortable, with six pillows, and a backrest pillow (properly named a 'husband pillow'), a nice desk with a comfortable leather swivel chair, free wifi, desk lamp, nightstand, bedside lamp, overhead room light, ceiling fan with three speed, a floor fan in your private closet if you're a fan sleeper, a third small table with a small monitor.

Flexable check in, check out. Private parking in the driveway.

I felt secure, safe, had a restful night, was never bothered, and knew if I needed anything, all I had to do was ask.

I would certainly stay here again, and would recommend Missy's place for the solo travler."
10765,259,Chris It was so nice having you. Hope you enjoyed spending time with you son and watching the game. Please come back any time.

10805,261,Really nice place everything was great wish we could’ve stayed longer
10806,261,"I had to travel with very short notice and had made a mistake in my reservation. They were super flexible and quick to respond. I was traveling to help my sister with a medical emergency. They also helped me find local restaurants. The house is in a perfect location, it was close to everything I needed. It was close to the hospital and was very easy to get to. The space was perfect for me and my mother to share. I will definitely recommend them to friends and family traveling to the Asheville area."

10829,261,"We had a fantastic stay at Sam and Gordy‘s! If I could give it more than five stars I would. You aren’t going to be able to beat the location, cleanliness, hosts and their communication or price. Highly recommend!"

10842,261,"I was in town for a wedding at Crest Pavilion. The airbnb was less than a minute down the road. It was also very easy to get into downtown. As for the airbnb itself, it was perfect! The bed was very comfortable. They have equipped the space with everything you could want to be comfortable.... a small table and chairs, welcome snack and waters, movies, plates/utensils, towels. The pictures don't do it justice in my opinion. Don't look any further, just stay here! next time I'm in Asheville, I will 100% be staying here again."

10848,261,I loved this place. The bed is super comfortable. There’s plenty of lighting options & a spacious bathroom :)
10849,261,Sam and Gordy are great hosts. They are attentive to your needs and respond immediately if you need anything. The apartment is clean and comfy and check-in was a breeze. The location is amazing. Ten minutes to downtown and the neighborhood is safe and quiet.
10850,261,"This place was perfect! Great location, cute space, cool artsy Asheville folks. The bed and bedding were SO COMFY I could’ve just stayed in the bed the whole time! Sam and Gordy went above and beyond and scraped the snow off of my car for me when 3 inches dumped over night and I had to get to a class in the morning! I would definitely stay here again!"
10851,261,Cozy place to stay in a very quiet neighborhood not too far away from everything.
10852,261,"Super clean, clear instructions, and a short drive from downtown. Everything was perfect!"
10853,261,"Awesome Awesome Awesome!
We loved Sam and Gordy’s home away from home. Lots of nice details to make you feel right at home the minute you walk in. Excellent communication. Well appointed. Very comfortable bed. Loved the touches like a nice selection of coffees, teas, jar of candies (my hubs enjoyed!). Very very clean. Highly recommend."
10854,261,Sam & Gordy are wonderful host. They provided all the ammenities listed on their page. Very clean and cozy and will visit again next time we are passing through.
10855,261,We are so glad we stayed at Sam and Gordy’s instead of a hotel. We felt like we were home all while being very close to downtown. You won’t be disappointed if you choose to stay here!
10856,261,Really great stay! Don’t hesitate on this one the location and hosts are both awesome!!!
10857,261,"Sam & Gordy offer a cozy and relaxing place to stay. The bed was comfortable, and I appreciated having water in the refrigerator. I used the Keurig to make a cup of hot tea, which was a nice way to unwind after traveling. Sam & Gordy were responsive and hospitable. I hope to have another reason to stay again very soon!"
10858,261,"Cute, clean, convenient accommodations! Communication was great as well!"
10859,261,Quiet neighborhood really close to downtown. Cute and clean. Hosts are very thoughtful; they even included a first aid kit.
10860,261,A comfortable and convenient spot close to downtown Asheville. Sam and Gordy were great hosts!
10861,261,"Sam and Gordy where great hosts. It was a great location, very clean and we would definitely stay here again."
10862,261,"A wonderful and easy experience with Sam and Gordy at their house, if you’re in the area and need a great place in a quiet neighborhood they’re the folks to go with!"
10863,261,This place was wonderful! The owners were super responsive and helped when I asked for it. Everything is super clean and would definitely go again!
10864,261,"Great location. Just as advertised. Loved the TLC they gave to the place. Will definitely stay there again.
Gordy and Sam were very pleasant and helpful"
10865,261,"This little stay is absolutely perfect for any couple visiting Asheville. Full of very thoughtful details, it is just as described. Even has a great collection of DVDs to choose from! Very close to the brewery district. Would absolutely stay again or recommend to a friend. Fantastic communication!"
10866,261,"Sam and Gordy have such a wonderful place that’s well decorated, very comfortable bed, private entrance, and many amenities. It’s very quite as well. Highly recommend!"
10867,261,"Only stayed for one night, but the space was well suited for a comfortable longer stay. Still a relatively short drive to points of interest. Would definitely consider staying here again!"
10868,261,"Sam and Gordy are excellent communicators and very accommodating. I didn't get to meet Sam unfortunately, but I got to meet Gordy as I was leaving and he was very friendly and left an overall great impression. They were non-intrusive and made it a point that I should let them know if there was anything I needed.
This is a great little spot for a solo traveler or a couple interested in exploring Asheville and surrounding areas. It's a safe and convenient location, and it sounded like Sam and Gordy are continuously improving the space to make sure their guests are happy and comfortable."
10869,261,"Excellent accommodations! Very clean, private entrance and back porch area. Highly recommend"
10870,261,Sam & Gordy we’re awesome! Didn’t get to meet them in person but we loved their place! Perfect for our stay in Asheville!
10871,261,Great spot to stay in for the night! The description is very accurate and the bed was extra comfy! Sam and Gordy were wonderful hosts :)
10872,261,"I can't stop raving to my friends and family about Sam & Gordy's wonderful place! I had the distinct feeling it was going to be a great stay when a hawk flew beside my car for a brief stretch on the way to their place. Of course, all the 5-star rave reviews were a good hint, too. ;-)

Sam & Gordy were fantastic hosts with quick responses, clear communications, and a genuine warm welcome (in person, if you want to meet them). I was so grateful for their recommendations for local restaurants (special mention to Nine Mile, where they serve not only delicious food but also positivity for the soul)! The apartment itself was beautifully appointed with an artistic eye for color and texture and was an all-out joy to spend time in. I could see how much thought went into the room setup, right down to the small shelves on either side of the bed, the power strip for multiple device plug-ins, and even some helpful brochures on some of Asheville's best attractions (which are all close by, since this Airbnb is only 10 minutes from downtown).

Something I didn't expect was deeply enjoying the use of the old-school DVD player in the bedroom. They have a small selection of really good movies (imho). I could just barely hear Sam & Gordy upstairs, which--as a woman traveling by herself--made me feel safe. I woke early the next morning and relaxed in one of the adirondak chairs, just breathing in the fresh mountain mist and enjoying the bird calls.I just needed a 1-night stay for this trip, but I'll be sure to work in a few more days next time! Thanks, Sam & Gordy, for helping me fall in love with Asheville on my first visit--you're awesome!"
10873,261,"Great AirBnB! Clean, nice, excellent value, nice amenities!"
10874,261,"This was a great place to stay! Travel nurse, and I was really just looking for a safe clean place to sleep but this exceeded my expectations. There is a private bathroom and entrance and they provided everything I needed. Plus their house is so cute and they were very kind!"
10875,261,"Perfect location, 5-10min from everything. Quiet room, everything we needed."
10876,261,"A nice comfortable place and good value, and a nice host too. I recommend this place if you stay in the area! Would stay here again!"
10877,261,"We stayed at Sam and Gordy’s for a wedding up the road and it was the perfect place to stay! Super close to the venue, and just 10 minutes away from the breweries downtown."
10878,261,"Cute little place, perfect for a short stay. Super clean!"
10879,261,Nice little spot near all the things you would want to do in Asheville. Highly recommend.
10880,261,"Great place---quiet, comfortable, fashionable, affordable. Was everything we were looking for. Fairly easy access to West Asheville and downtown Asheville. Would certainly stay there again."
10881,261,"I stayed 5 nights in this comfy, clean, quiet studio, located only about a 12 minute drive from downtown Asheville. It was well-stocked, and had a private door and bathroom. I never met Sam and Gordy in person, but they were very helpful when the lock box needed a new battery early in my stay. Took care of it right away. This was a great value, because Asheville hotels are super booked up during the summer tourist season, and I was having a hard time finding a room!"
10882,261,"I visited Asheville for the weekend and had an amazing time. Sam & Grody's place was extremely clean, quiet, and in a great location. It is about 10 minutes from downtown Asheville where all the great stores, restaurants, and breweries are. I would definitely recommend staying here and would definitely stay here again!"
10883,261,"Great location. Ten minutes from downtown and less than ten minutes from New Belgium and the river arts district. If you need a cute little bedroom with a private bath, this is a great option !"
10884,261,Feels like you are in the country but only a short drive to all attractions in Asheville. Nice quiet neighborhood.
10885,261,We enjoyed our stay! Very nice accommodations. So clean and comfortable with nice little added touches to make you feel welcome.
10886,261,Beautiful hidden gem. Super close to all things amazing West Asheville has to offer. The hosts are kind and were helpful with any questions we had during our stay. Great stay.
10887,261,"Very cozy, plenty of restaurants/breweries/things to do just a quick car ride away. Room was very clean and Sam and Gordy were very nice when we crossed paths with them as we were leaving."
10888,261,"Great location, good space. Still private even though you're in their house. They had some snacks and waters for us so that was a plus. Would stay again."
10889,261,"Sam & Gordy's place was a great stay! Very clean, easy to access, and overall a great experience. Would definitely recommend!"
10890,261,Easy in and out. Items in place for guests as if they were staying there themselves. Nice and tidy!
10891,261,very nice place
10892,261,"Quite, Clean and convenient location to Asheville and the River Arts District. Great little touches such as coffee, water and snacks made the stay great."
10893,261,"Everything was wonderful! Communication was great and there were many thoughtful touches (waters in the mini fridge, breakfast bars, coffee). It was conveniently located and was easy for us to get to all of our favorite places. Great stay!"
10894,261,Nice clean space. Sam and Gordy were responsive with easy check in. Enjoyed being so close to W Asheville and Richmond Hill Park.
10895,261,Very thoughtful hosts. It was a quick overnight stay and last minute too. They were accommodating and the place was cozy!
10896,261,"Sam & Gordy were very nice, and they were very diligent and clear with communication! The room was super clean, great amenities, and decorated nicely- not to mention it smelled wonderful! My boyfriend and I felt at home, and we were able to kick back and enjoy some of the movies that they had at the place. It was very close to downtown Asheville also which was very convenient. The next time we are in town we certainly plan to visit again!"
10897,261,What an amazing stay! The place was perfect for me and my boyfriend for Valentine's Day. Everything was set up clean and ready to go for us when we got there. They even left us a box of chocolates! Sam was wonderful to talk to and answered all the questions we had quickly! It was even close to downtown and everything we wanted to do. We will definitely be staying here again!
10898,261,Wonderfully located to all the must-see and do spots of Asheville! Easy check-in and great communication! We appreciated the k-cup coffee machine and mugs. Space heater was provided as well as toiletries! Super cute studio bed and bath!
10899,261,Sam was very kind and communicative when I booked his Airbnb. I felt frantic when trying to look for a place last minute to stay but he was extremely accommodating throughout the whole process. Highly would recommend!
10900,261,🖤🖤 love ittt
10901,265,A great place to stay when you want to be close to Greenville but want the quietness of being out of town. Always a pleasure to stay here.
10902,265,Thanks for the great place to stay!!!
10903,265,Lovely cottage…very unique and charming! I really enjoyed my stay and Meagan was responsive when I had questions.
10904,265,"Cozy, convenient and charming, this is a great place to stay."
10905,265,Very pleased!
10906,265,Great
10907,265,Great stay in a cozy cottage. Warm and quiet for a winter evening! Hope to stay again when in the area.
10908,265,Always a great place to stay!
10909,265,"Cozy, quaint, and clean!"
10910,265,"Despite the turbulent NC weather, this little house is ready for it all. It’s always a pleasure to stay here."
10911,265,"Farmville is a wonderful community! The tiny house is close enough to town for a VERY SHORT walk to multiple restaurants, a grocery store, even a church. The tiny house was clean, well stocked with nice towels, and had a comfy bed. This tiny house is is super clean and cozy. It looks just like the pictures, if not better. The value of what I got for what I paid was incredible. After arriving in an Uber, from the airport, I stayed here for the week while attending a class at North Carolina Furniture School. I was able to walk the town with no problem. It’s safe and scenic. If you’ve never been to FarmVille it looks like the set of every Hallmark movie ever. I highly recommend staying here. It would even be a neat place for locals to have a fun weekend staycation. If I come back for more classes, I will book here again.

If they will have me…

2 THUMBS UP!"
10912,265,I needed a place to stay the night and to visit with my son who is an ECU student. It was so easy to find and not far from where I had to park. The squirrels and birds kept me entertained while I sat inside the cabin with the door open. The heater was very warm at night and the mattress was very comfortable. I felt very safe at this tiny home. I would definitely book again.
10913,265,"such a cute tiny home! check in was extremely easy, the home was spotlessly clean with a lot of amenities that even some hotels don't offer. highly recommend!"
10914,265,I can't imagine a better place to stay in Farmville. I like a walkable location and this location was just that. Cute little downtown. Very pleasantly surprised by the quality of nearby restaurants. Cute suite. I wish I'd used the tub.
10915,265,"Straight forward check-in/out, and a quiet, peaceful, and private-feeling stay. While a small town, I was surprised by the well-rounded variety of businesses--all the amenities you could need for a short getaway within walking distance!

Owners seemed very willing to offer any assistance if needed, but also respected the privacy of introverts like myself -- much appreciated!

Overall a great experience that I'd recommend to others!"
10916,265,"This place is amazing. It lives up to its expectations, and makes for a nice, quiet getaway."
10917,265,"Such a charming, unique little house. Close to owners but was very quiet and private. Loved the comfy bed in the cozy loft. Seamless check in, and even nicer than the pics!"
10918,265,"My wife and I have stayed here before and will continue to do so. We recommend the place. It is peaceful, quiet, and just as described."
10919,265,This place was so calming and comforting! Exactly what I needed that week! Thank you!!
10920,265,The place was pristine and welcoming as always. It’s always a pleasure when we go by and stay.
10921,265,"Maegans place was as described, easily located, clean and welcoming. Felt very comfortable and at home when I arrived. Well maintained! Hope to stay again!"
10922,265,"This was such a great stay! I felt so safe and it was an easy drive to ECU. It looks better in person, and the loft was extra fun."
10923,265,"Very quiet and private. Very basic, but in a good way. Easy walking distance from downtown eateries and a grocery store."
10924,265,"Maegan and Eric were incredible hosts. They were so accommodating, understanding, and quick to respond. Their small home is adorable and very creative. It’s nice, cozy, and best of all, private. You get the sense of being in a secluded area all while having the town be within literal walking distance. Thank you for opening up your home to us.
It’s a must stay if you’re ever in the area, or even if you need to be Greenville (it’s only about 15mins away; very close and manageable). We will definitely be back!"
10925,265,The was was amazing it was super cozy close to lost of stuff and was incredible for the short stay that my Fiancé and I had there.
10926,265,"I have no idea if my message to Maegan went through, but I had trouble with the heating unit and texted her early evening. I ended up 'camping out' with pillows over me freezing all night. However, the accommodations far exceeded a little frostbite on my nose! Everything was so delightful! I especially appreciated my warm bath in the very large tub! This place is uniquely designed. Everything is at your fingertips, and presented very logically and with taste."
10927,265,Wonderful little guesthouse with the most comfortable sleeping arrangements!
10928,265,Amazing experiences await you here! Maegan was the absolute best host I’ve ever had. Will be booking again soon.
10929,265,"My stay was relaxing, peaceful, cozy and I felt like I was visiting my grandmother’s cottage from childhood. It was a quirky little green oasis tucked between houses only a block or two away from Main St. It was wonderful to be able to walk to lots of interesting places and find everything I needed and wanted. I really enjoyed the colorful murals and was very pleasantly surprised that the “Art Scene” was so vibrant in town. Thank you!"
10930,265,"Exactly as described, such a cute place and very clean! The area is so peaceful and perfect for a quiet morning walk! I would definitely stay again!"
10931,265,"If you’re looking for cozy stay, look no further! This was exactly what we were looking for. It’s not too far from Greenville but also far enough away to enjoy peace and quiet. The pictures do not do this tiny house justice. From the first moment we walked in, we were floored by the log cabin aesthetic. The shower and heater hit just the spot to keep us warm from the North Carolina cold.

One tip for future visitors: the hot water for the sink is on the right side (not left). This wasn’t a problem once we figured it out!"
10932,265,Wonderful home where you have everything you need for a fair and reasonable price. Great local community and wonderful hosts who provide for you and are available to help with whatever you need. Would definitely recommend staying here!
10933,265,Very cute and cozy nice and quiet
10934,265,"The Little House was a perfect stay for me.
Quiet. Clean. Simple. Comfortable bed.
Eric and Maegan were quick with communication.
I hope to stay again in the future.

Also, if you stay there… go to Farmer and the Dail restaurant. About 10 minutes away but so good."
10935,265,"For our 2nd stay, we again enjoyed the privacy and the experience of a tiny home with its antique tub and beautiful quarter sawn oak wall and mirror features. Comfortable and convenient, it is tucked behind the hosts’ home. Just a few blocks walk to Farmville’s Main Street restaurants for eat-in or take away, plus the delightful Cafe Madeleine Bakery and Wine for breakfast is even closer. We walked less than a mile to Duck Rabbit Craft Brewery. For the experience and value this Airbnb offers, we hope to return again."
10936,265,"Maegan was quick to respond and easy to communicate with. The entire process was smooth, easy, and pleasant."
10937,265,"The house is adorable! I had an amazing night of sleep as well. It was a super short stay, but if I am ever in the area again I will definitely book another stay."
10938,265,Adorable home. Lovely downtown with great restaurants. Really enjoyed my stay peaceful and relaxing.
10939,265,Wonderful place to stay. A little scary to climb the ladder to the loft area but it’s so comfy to sleep on the bed provided. I found the Wi-Fi to be a little weaker in the loft area. Other than that I think it has everything you’ll need for a fantastic getaway. I loved it..
10940,265,Perfect place to rest on the road
10941,265,"I was up there for the weekend working in Greenville. I found Maegan and Eric’s tiny house on Airbnb. It was easy to check in, very quiet, and very clean as well! I would definitely stay here again as I travel up to Greenville!"
10942,265,"please don't miss out on this hidden Litttle gem! it's literally the perfect getaway even if it's only seven minutes away (for me) Everything down to the walk to the house was very enlightening.
FYI you have to try out the bathtub & the water pressure was to die for very clean and creative!"
10943,265,Meagan’s place was such a lovely experience! I needed a place last minute to stop for a night along my drive south. It was easy to get in and had everything I needed just as described. The place was so cute and cozy and such great ambiance and energy inside and on the property. Meagan was easy to communicate with and quick to respond. I would definitely stay here again. I didn’t get to check out the town but it looked quaint and charming as I drove through. Great experience all around. Thank you!!
10944,265,"Thank you again, I enjoyed my stay."
10945,265,Cute place with great bakery nearby!
10946,265,Peaceful place to stay
10947,265,Such a cute airbnb and town! A perfect tiny home
10948,265,Comfy home perfect for what I needed it for host was very attentive and hour was very clean
10949,265,10/10 amazing. Perfect hosts and the house is amazing very homey and relaxing.
10950,265,Fantastic place love it
10951,265,I loved the decor and the overall feel of the house! It was a southern charm in the heart of a nice quiet town. Exactly what I needed :)
10952,265,"Great place to stay for a solo traveller. The loft is so relaxing and cozy. I was able to drive to Emerald Isle beach from here and stay all day and come back to the perfect nest. Hopefully the koi pond will be restored by the time I come back, which I certainly plan to one day!"
10953,265,I came looking for a place to stay…instead I found a place that will always stay with me.
10954,265,"Fantastic time spent at this quaint home in Farmville, NC. We were there to help our daughter move in to the dorms so we were rather busy but appreciated coming back to this comfortable, peaceful home to lay our heads down for much needed rest at the end of our long days! Our only regret is that we were not able to meet our hosts due to our schedule. We would love to learn more of what FarmVille has to offer…. Next time! Thank you, Meagan for a wonderful stay!"
10955,265,Great place for the value! Farmland was just as expected. Quiet and peaceful small town life. Megan and Eric were great getting us a cutting board and knife to cut a couple local melons we bought. FarmVille pizza was terrific and so were the brews at DuckRabbit brewing. We would stay again.
10956,265,"This was a cozy little place you can really enjoy. Very clean and it is everything you read about and more! Very inviting, and I loved the clawfoot tub. I also loved my coffee in the morning... My boyfriend and I enjoyed our stay and the privacy we got! Food is just around the corner, and you should try the Plank SteakHouse.
I am an ECU graduate, and Greenville is not far. It was nice to drive a few minutes to see the campus again and buy a few things.
This place is a sure winner!!!! Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!"
10957,265,Quiet peaceful and clean. Just what I needed after work. Relaxing and I will probably stay again if they have a vacancy during trips up there the next couple of months.
10958,265,"This is a decent place to sleep and good for a SOLO traveler (or maybe a smaller couple). It’s small and cozy, rustic and simple.

Highlights: easy parking, very quiet, simple entry and exit, good temp control with ac and several fans, good mini fridge, microwave, and coffee machine, close to grocery and several restaurants, highly walkable, safe neighborhood and close (20 min or so) to Greenville. I also really liked the stained glass windows in the door!

Critiques: the loft is really a loft. If you have any mobility or balance issues, do not stay here. The ladder is stable, but narrow, and pretty tough to navigate in the dark. Not really a major downside, just something to know.

Also, kind of minor, but the toilet could use a new seat as the current one is a bit cracked and old, and the tub/shower could use a shelf or caddy for storing soaps. The mattress is also not very comfortable - kind of thin and not super supportive. I got used to it after a few days but woke up sore on the first morning.

Maegan and Eric were very communicative, especially when there was a brief power outage, and kindly brought over some flashlights. I’d stay here again."
10959,265,There couldn’t be a more accommodating host! Would most defiantly stay there again!!
10960,265,I came down to Greenville weekly for work for a few months. I stayed here for the majority of the weeks/ whenever the dates aligned. This Airbnb had everything I needed plus the wonderful hospitality of Maegan and Eric. I loved that it was only a quick hour from Raleigh and still convenient to ECU/ Vidant Medical Center. I wish I had had more time to explore Farmville- it has an awesome vibe. Highly recommend!
10961,265,"A great, comfortable home in a perfect location for walking to restaurants and shopping. I would love to stay here again."
10962,265,This little space was ADORABLE and I definitely plan on staying again. It's very quiet and tucked away. I wasn't initially super crazy about the parking situation but it seemed like a quiet enough street with not a ton of traffic.
10963,265,"I had a very nice 4 night stay. I was using the unit only when sleeping, bathing and dressing. My time was spent Greenville. The neighborhood is very quiet and safe. Parking on the street wasn’t a problem. The house was quaint, clean and adequate. TV and two high back chairs in a small sitting area. Coffee maker and free coffee was very convenient. The shower is a curtain-surround of a large cast bathtub and there is a ladder that you must climb to get into the loft area to sleep. Be sure you are able to handle both before booking. Would recommend to all travelers; those intending to use the house as an office or business (WiFi) less so."
10964,265,Close to everything great place to stay
10965,265,"Good place to get some rest, farther off my route than expected but great value and rest for a single person or couple on a road trip."
10966,265,"We had a very nice stay. The house is close to dining ad shopping-less than a block away! The neighborhood is very quiet, clean, and safe. There is a ladder that you must climb to get into the loft area to sleep. Be sure you are able to navigate a ladder before you arrive. Very fun tiny house!"
10967,265,"Love this place, it is sooo cute!!!! I would definitely stay here again."
10968,265,This was my third stay and won’t be my last. Loved listening to storms rolling in from the loft. I had a major snafu and Maegan and Tim were very kind.
10969,265,Repeat guest- love this little spot!
10970,265,"The home was adorable!! It was exactly like the picture. Maegan was really nice, I would definitely stay again."
10971,265,Maegan was a great host and we plan to stay with her again! We look forward to returning to FarmVille and getting to stay again!!
10972,265,I absolutely loved the place! Loved the cozy rustic aesthetic. Would stay here again in the future!
10973,265,tiny but cozy and comfortable and in a great location stores restaurants and historical buildings right in walking distance amazing place to stay
10974,265,"Comfortable, peaceful, delightful. The tiny house is well-planned & well-decorated; and Maegan is always available if needed. The neighborhood is quiet and within the historic district, and you can easily bike around town or out to country roads. Farmville is a quaint, friendly town and I wish I was still there! All around, a wonderful stay."
10975,265,Charming and unique. A must stay getaway in the beautiful town of Farmville.
10976,265,Quaint and cozy with pleasant little surprises. 10/10 would recommend.
10977,265,"The space is exactly as listed and, if anything, is more charming in person. We loved our stay and would definitely look at staying here again if life brings us back to the area!"
10978,265,It’s a really cool little spot!
10979,265,Great!!! Very great with communicating. Really cute space.
10980,265,"what a treat to arrive at such awesome environment for my second b&b visit. I look forward to many more of this quality. family friendly yard, with fire pit, ready, play area, water 🌊 feature, two eating zones, & benches, all manicured towards NATURE flowing right into ta mini home.

thank you so much Megan and Greg for maintaining and sharing with our community."
10981,265,.
10982,265,Cute & cozy place in a great location.
10983,265,It was very cozy and perfect.
10984,265,"The place is so cute, clean, and very well equipped, and the bed is comfortable. The only thing that wasn’t great was the heating situation- there is a small heater that can either be on low or high, and even if it is 30° outside and it is on the low setting, you will boil up in the loft/sleeping area after a couple hours… or if the heater is turned off completely, it will be 50° inside when you wake up. Other than that we had a great stay!"
10985,267,"Enjoyed my stay. Christine was so friendly! It was a guest room in their house with a shared bathroom, but that was fine. I did try to attend an online stranded class for school and the wifi wouldn't support that, had to use my cell phone hot spot."
10986,267,"Christine and her husband were great hosts! Very friendly, and pleasant. I have a really flexible schedule; late nights early mornings and they were able to accommodate. The house was very clean, the bedroom private. If you are in need of sleep, I would suggest booking with them for just the mattress alone! Overall my stay was pleasant and problem free. I would book again...😀"
10987,267,"Great place to stay! Christine is very welcoming and quick to communicate. Very accommodating, would recommend!"
10988,267,I had very comfortable and pleasant stay.. Quite neighborhood ..
10989,267,I am glad your stay was comfortable and you are welcome back and time!

10998,267,"Such a lovely, clean, and quiet place to stay! The atmosphere in the home is beyond welcoming and loving.
I enjoyed my time here with Christine and look forward to staying again when able to."
10999,267,"This stay is in a quiet very safe upscale neighborhood. Hosts are very friendly, accommodating, and quick to respond. Location is conveniently near highways and any other needs. Bed is ultra comfortable."
11000,267,"It was a great place to stay; wonderful, comfortable room and lovely hosts. Thank you!"
11001,267,"Sparkling clean, cute decorations, warm hospitality, and clear communication."
11002,267,You are so welcome dear!! You are welcome back anytime!!
11003,267,Great place to stay for the price.
11004,267,"Great location, wonderful value, and very clean and comfortable room. Would stay here again"
11005,267,Nice stay
11006,267,"You really cannot miss Christine’s house of you travel in Durham, it just can’t be too true calling it home away home! She’s so so sweet and kind, I enjoyed my stay so much with her. I’d choose her place again without any doubt if I can travel in NC another time. Just don’t miss such a good choice if you’re looking for a ideal Airbnb now!"
11007,267,Christine's place was great. I felt very welcomed and comfortable there. She even let me do a load of laundry which was very helpful. I definitely recommend this place.
11008,267,I am glad to have had the opportunity to Host! I am glad you felt welcome and at home. Good Luck on your new job adventure.
11009,267,Christine was super helpful and accommodating. The room was exactly as advertised. I especially loved the soft bed and super soft bath towel. The home is in a very nice and quiet neighborhood and I felt totally comfortable the whole time. I hope to stay again when in the area.
11010,267,"Great hosts!
Was surprised by the shared bathroom."
11011,267,"Thanks for your stay. We enjoyed having you. As stated in our listing, it's a shared home~~~private room with shared areas. No private bathroom stated. Keep us in mind if you're in town again!"
11012,267,Outstanding neighborhood. Street parking. Clean home with amazing hosts. I couldn't be happier.
11013,267,The family was exceptionally accommodating. I felt very comfy at their home..
11014,267,"I had a wonderful stayed as I had a job interview in the city, and they give me too much positive vibes. I really appreciate it. God bless them. I got the job. Thank you.

Great home to stay."
11015,267,Christine is a great host that accommodates for her guest requests graciously. Thanks Christine!
11016,267,Christine was nice host to me .. location is great for travel rdu/duke/and surrounding family oriented entertainment
11017,267,Comfortable stay. Christine and here husband were responsive and excellent hosts.
11018,267,"Christine was very polite and kind. I came back late and left early during my stay, and she responded to my messages quickly and was very accommodating of my odd hours. The house itself was neat and clean and in a nice suburban neighborhood. Overall, I'd recommend it if you don't mind sharing the house with the hosts."
11019,267,"Best stay so far w air bnb, great family, very nice place"
11020,270,for the price just to have a place to rest/sleep it was right.
11021,270,"Made a last minute booking on my way to Asheville. Location is great, next to some really cute cafes and shops. Hostel itself is very charming and easy to get to, with parking around back. Check in/check out is super easy and the hosts are very responsive to questions."
11022,270,"Great place for a couple of nights stay! I felt that my possessions were well secured within the locker that I locked with my own lock. Other folks stored their possessions under the beds for easy access. Communication was great and I was notified promptly when the main entrance combo was changed. For a hostel, the cleanliness is pretty good. Not as good as a hotel but good enough for what it is. Very cool people stayed here also and it was awesome to meet them. Overall would definitely recommend this hostel if you want a cheaper place to stay."
11023,270,"Great place to stay to meet people and travel solo. I’m a baby when it comes to temperature, so the dorm was a little too warm for my liking, otherwise everything went smoothly and I added on another day!"
11024,270,"Great comfortable place to stay, relaxed and cheerful. Pretty porch and backyard and a cool old house. Has everything you need, except maybe coffee cups on a busy morning! It was a comfy stay in a cute and fun neighborhood with very nice folks :)"
11025,270,Great hostel and super friendly staff. Had everything I could’ve needed.
11026,270,Cool vibes in this hostel. Located near many shops and restaurants!
11027,270,Great environment!
11028,270,"Very interesting experience staying in the hostel it reminded me of when I was in boarding school, overall it was a great experience. There’s lots of restaurants and busy life around but in the hostel itself it’s quiet.
The place is clean, received excellent communication after booking. Thank you Bonpaul😊"
11029,270,"Hike, drink, sleep"
11030,270,"This was just what I needed for a night in Asheville! The location is close to town and right next door to a cute local coffee shop. Parking in the back is limited but there is 24/7 street parking if the lot in the back is full. I initially thought the whole hostel was female only, but then realized there are just separate rooms within the hostel for coed and female only, each with locks on the doors. I really enjoyed getting to meet some cool people while staying here. I felt safe and comfortable here and would come back again!"
11031,270,"great location, friendly people!"
11032,270,Definitely worth your money! If you’re looking to meet new people! This is the place to be!! Very accommodating!
11033,270,"This was my 2nd hostel experience and I really enjoyed it. Met some kindred souls along the way and shared and received some valuable information. ✨ The place is so nice and cozy like a ""home-y"" feel. If I'm ever in the area I would definitely stay here again. 👍🏾"
11034,270,"This is my first time staying at a hostel, and there wasn't an issue for me. I stayed in the female dorm. Pay attention to which bed you reserve, because that's the bed you're asked to use (I got a top bunk, which wasn't an issue, and actually may have been better with creating the physical distancing that's recommended right now. If you're a light sleeper, you may hear doors opening and closing throughout the night, but considering this is a safe, clean spot to crash, it wasn't an issue for me. The other boarders in the room I was in were getting ready to turn out the lights when I got back (a little after 10, and I was pretty exhausted), so I didn't have any issues with lights being on when I was tired or noise in the room. I think there are 2.5 baths, and although there wasn't a scheduling board, I didn't have any issues with it being occupied when I needed it. The value and location of this is what led me to giving five stars. Considering it's peak fall season, and every other place wanted to charge $200, this is really a great value for the location, if you're looking to save. It's right in the heart of West Asheville, near all the murals, French Broad River area park, and several dining options are within walking distance. Note towels are downstairs on a towel rack near the couches (I missed that part), and the bin to place sheets is next to the loveseat. I don't think I encountered the host, but communication and instructions were straight-forward."
11035,270,"The hostel environment felt welcoming. Easy to park in the back. Easy to access with a code for the outside door and also a code for each bunk area which felt very secure.

Great location if you want to enjoy the restaurants on the West Side of Asheville. Allow time for traffic if travelling to center Asheville. The breakfast supply is adequate and the kitchen is very guest-friendly, if you want to prep your own breakfast.

I stayed in the ""female dorm top bunk #2"". I wish I had looked more closely at my reservation and I would have chosen the lower bunk.

Price was right, especially since breakfast food is included."
11036,270,"Great location, nice staff and good amenities. Ended up having the shared room to myself which was great! Thanks BonPaul!"
11037,270,It’s a very affordable place and you can walk to bars and coffee shops and other shops from there. It’s a good place to meet new people and awesome location
11038,270,"Great place to stay on a budget or passing through town.

Located near tons of restaurants and only a 10 min drive to the River Arts District

I would suggest bringing a lock for the lockers if you want to store anything valuable inside the room.

I had a wonderful stay and would recommend it to others."
11039,270,"Nice hostel in a great location. Easy check in, comfortable bed and nice shared space. For the traveler who needs something affordable, this was perfect."
11040,270,A lovely place to stay. Well located and very clean. Would stay again.
11041,270,"Nice, friendly and clean, recommended!"
11042,270,Great location and value!
11043,270,Very clean and comfortable
11044,270,very good place
11045,270,"Fun spot with friendly people! It is a hostel, so plan on bringing earplugs if you're a light sleeper."
11046,270,"This hostel was very comfortable, clean and excellently run. All the staff were helpful and friendly and communication via AirBnB was excellent.

If you don’t have a car Downtown Asheville is about one hours walk away. Even if you have a car I’d recommend walking or getting a bus as finding free parking is a bit of a nightmare. Having said that West Asheville has many cool restaurants and shops of its own to keep you amused.

My one “complaint” point would be that the breakfast promised in “breakfast included” barely exists. It often consisted of just a small loaf of bread and a few hard-boiled eggs (often a few days old) to share between everyone. Basically just factor in that you will be having to buy your own stuff for breakfast or eat out. It was this slightly misleading inclusion in the description that made me mark it 4* rather than 5."
11047,270,Clean and right by alot of great food places in walking distance! The convenience of the keycodes was nice as well.
11048,270,Clean and great space for price. Friendly employee at check-in and willing to answer questions. I was a little worried about having to wait for the bathroom since there were 5 ppl in a room and 2.5 baths but that was never a problem. My only complaints would be the entrance door slamming and distance from town but I’m not sure there’s much that can be changed about either of those.
11049,270,I enjoyed staying. I had a car so it was easy to reach the downtown of Asheville.
11050,270,Quick place to sleep before a big solo hike. The area and house felt very safe.
11051,270,"Great, affordable place to stay!"
11052,270,Beautiful place with lots of character. The staff was great and the location is awesome.
11053,270,"Great spot, value for money is on point and it’s in a fun and trendy area of town. Had the best Matcha Latte at the coffee shop next door :)"
11054,270,"I loved my stay here!! The hostel was cozy, laid-back, clean, quiet and homey. Catnap, Daniel and Matt were super helpful, kind, authentic and hospitable. The home is in an awesome location in West Asheville, where I spent a lot of time but also super close to downtown and river arts district. My stay was beautiful, perfect and comfortable. So grateful and will go back when I return :)"
11055,270,"Close to airport, very affordable, clean, safe and everyone was friendly."
11056,270,"The place is awesome. Perfect location that is walking distance to lots of cool spots, friendly staff who gave me a thorough tour, clean, rad decor. I would stay here again."
11057,270,I loved my stay at BonPaul and Sharky’s and I will definitely be back. The beds were the most comfortable hostel beds I’ve ever slept in and the people (guests and staff) were rad!
11058,270,"This place was wonderful. I was looking for a conveniently located and inexpensive place to crash for a night, and this was everything I needed. Staff was attentive and friendly, and the other guests were polite and kind. Glad I chose to stay here and I would seek this place out again on future trips to Asheville."
11059,270,"Beyond grateful I chose to stay here! The location is amazing, the space is cozy, bed super comfy, and all the people are respectful, friendly, and overall wonderful! Had a beautiful time here, absolutely would stay again. Infinitely thanks xo"
11060,270,"Great location, great place. Would stay there again"
11061,270,Simple place but has everything you need!
11062,270,"very clean, organized, and felt safe at all times; house decor was eclectic and perfect for the place. breakfast food available and free hummus. perfect location because walking distance to restaurants and a couple of cool breweries.

would definitely stay there again."
11063,270,A nice place with warm atmosphere.
11064,270,Great little hostel right on Haywood Street in West Asheville- always interesting people to meet and talk to coming in and out of that place. Thanks for the room guys!
11065,270,Second time staying here and I wouldn't stay anywhere else. Love the vibe and you always meet cool people!
11066,270,Great staff and amenities! This was my first time in a hostel and it was a wonderful experience. I'm planning to return next summer for Moogfest!
11067,270,"Cool place and even cooler people, I'll definitely be staying there next time I visit Asheville."
11068,270,My stay was so comfortable. I felt safe and at home. I really enjoyed the tiny house as well as the bunk with the other girls. Everyone was quiet and respectful.
11069,270,"Great location near Grocery stores, restaurants and shops. Safe neighborhood to be in.
With 2 1/2 baths, there was no wait for bathrooms which is always great.
Kitchen has all you need and was very clean.
WiFi worked well and is free.
There is a small"
11070,270,Asheville is a super cool place!
11071,270,"Great place to stay in the historic west end which is an up and coming artsy part of town with great places to eat and drink. A bit far from the rest of town though. It was quiet, comfortable and safe. Perfect first stop on my road trip."
11072,270,"Good location in west Asheville, a bit far from downtown Asheville. Only three bathrooms for entire hostel, had trouble getting to shower sometimes. Other than that, great calhe"
11073,270,"It was a pleasure staying at this hostel. I was crashing in town just for the night. My stay was comfortable, convenient and affordable. Bon Paul and Sharkys has a nice atmosphere, friendly staff and travelers. I would stay here again! 💖"
11074,270,"Friendly, efficient staff. I stayed in the female dorm, which carries with it the pros and cons of being a dorm. The windows stay open at night in the summer to circulate air, but the street is noisy, so you may want some earplugs with you."
11075,270,"Everyone was so welcoming and respectful. There is so much to do in the area, you can't go wrong staying at BonPauls."
11076,270,"Bon Paul Hostel in West Asheville is my absolute favorite place to stay whenever I stay the night there. The location is great for walking to bars, shops, and restaurants, and plus you get to meet travelers from all over the place when you stay there. It's a great place to stay if you'd like to have the full experience of Asheville, especially since West Asheville is more where the locals hang out anyways."
11077,270,"Great hostel w friendly hosts in West Asheville. Clean comfy beds and cute, eclectic common areas. Thx guys!"
11078,270,"Not for the super private or particular traveler, but perfect for an affordable place to sleep while passing through town."
11079,270,"I booked my stay last night and was pleasantly surprised by their communication. They were able to accommodate me under short notice and communicated with me every step of the way. I loved how clean and friendly their environment is. BonPaul provides you coffee and a light breakfast in the morning. Their staff, more specifically Francesa, is so sweet! She was amazing with recommendations and knew exactly what I needed. My experience with the guests at BonPaul was lovely as well. I highly recommend their hostel if you're looking for a laid back stay in Asheville!"
11080,270,Great place for travelers! Great food near by! Parking can be difficult as there is limited space in the back but everyone was super friendly and communication with Host was easy!
11081,270,"This place is literally the best, by far. And the staff is amazing! A little far from downtown but the area around it is quite nice. I definitely recommend this hostel if you are staying in Asheville!! <3 <3 <3"
11082,270,"The place was awesome. They were friendly, helpful, and very clear on the rules (simple rules). Everything was clean and the bed was super comfy! I definitely recommend coming here. Great location as well."
11083,270,Nice and unique hostel to stay. The host is very friendly and helpful on hosting me.
11084,270,The staff is friendly and it's in a great location!
11085,270,Liked the place. Large and clean and quiet. Wish it was closer to walk downtown
11086,270,BonPaul's is a great place to stay! Clean and very friendly staff.
11087,270,Had an amazing time staying at the hostel! Franchesca was very helpful and fun to talk to! I would definitely come back to stay my next time in Asheville
11088,270,"Staff was so friendly, and the hostel was cute and clean enough, and very conveniently located. however there were some local guests who crashed at the hostel who were rude, followed us around, and got dangerously drunk. That was a little disconcerting. Also, to no fault of the staff, a guest vomited in one of the bathrooms making it almost unusable in the morning a guests were scrambling to get bathroom time."
11089,270,"Great hospitality from the hosts. Open in communication and easy to get a hold of them. Bare bones accommodations, but what to expect from a hostel. However was extremely disappointed in the state of the bathrooms. They REALLY need to be redone. The tiling of the bathtub is worse than I've ever seen in any hostel I've experienced, and that's with several even in Europe."
11090,270,This is my second stay at Bon Paul' s and it was great once again. Check-in was easy and once I got settled I walk to the Westville Pub for dinner and then the Hop for dessert!! The following morning I was up and out early to hike for the day!!
11091,270,"This was my first experience staying at a hostel, and I loved it! The staff was friendly, the room was clean, and the location was great! I would definitely stay here again!"
11092,270,Great place to stay. Exactly as described. Nice people and well organized.
11093,270,"The best hostel I've stayed at. All the hosts and guests were extremely friendly and welcoming. I was impressed at how clean the whole place was, including the bedrooms and bathrooms. They made it super easy to go in/out of the place, and I felt super comfortable from the minute I walked in. In a great location, close to a lot of cute restaurants/shops, and about a 10 minute drive to downtown."
11094,270,This was our second time staying here because we loved it so much the first time. The only difference is we brought friends so they could bask in the greatness that is Asheville. It's in the perfect spot in West Nashville and great affordable way to see the city. Will def be staying there again :)
11095,270,"Loved this hostel! The check in was easy and painless, amenities were just what we needed, the atmosphere was welcoming and comfortable, the location was perfect :)"
11096,270,"This hostel was perfect! Very secure with keypads on the doors and rules about guests and things. Staff all live there and were very friendly and helpful. The house was very clean and they provided everything you might need - pillows, blankets, towels, cook ware, full kitchen, etc. The back porch is really nice and there is plenty of space out back for parking. The house is in a good location for walking to restaurants and bars in West Asheville."
11097,270,"Hostels in small towns become guesthouses/homestays. You come as a stranger, you leave as a Family Member. I found two hiking buddies that day! Chill House"
11098,270,Awesome! Great space! Reasonable price! Made me feel right at home. Probably the most reasonable place to stay in all o' Asheville
11099,270,"This was the perfect place for me to stay on my solo trip to Asheville where I was able to meet cool people, sleep on a (super) comfy bed, and enjoy beautiful days out on the porch. All of the people who work at the hostel were extremely friendly and helpful. I have already recommended this place to several of my friends and I can't wait to go back! I am grateful that something so perfect is walking distance from bars, restaurants, and even an Ingles :)"
11100,270,"Bon Paul & Sharky's is a cool place to stay if you are just in town to check out the city and don't have a set schedule. This was my first experience with a hostel, or dorm of any type. I really liked the vibe of the house and everyone seemed friendly. It truly is everything they advertise. That said, if you are in town for a conference or classes, this may not be the best place to crash. There are many people sharing 2.5 baths on a first come first serve basis, so having to scramble for bathroom time in the morning when you have to be somewhere at a particular time can be a bit tricky. Also, if you are not a heavy sleeper you can be woken up by others coming in and out of the room or talking in the hallway. They do provide ear plugs, but if you need to wake up to an alarm you are taking a risk using them (Of course, if you don't hear it and it wakes someone else up, I'm sure they would let you know). This is NOT IN ANY WAY a criticism of Bon Paul & Sharky's; it is just an observation of dorm style accommodations in general. All in all, I would stay here again if I were in town just to explore the city with no agenda."
11101,270,Great for budget travellers. I have stayed in hostels abroad and this one is clean and comfortable.
11102,270,"The staff was delightful! Good humored, obliging, and great at sharing everything: good food, company, local information and the beds were fantastic! Fine mattresses, bunks with enough space not to bang your head on the one above. Bathrooms were immaculate (morning and evening cleaning), thank heaven, as some of the guests were slobs. They had a wonderful selection of books on hand to read, borrow, and take away (yes, I took one). Most of all the staff made the visit wonderful by their sincere presence."
11103,270,"This place was a blessing. It definitely has a homey feeling and the staff was very hospitable.
I will definitely come back. The location was great, everything was just around the corner. The other people staying within the hostel were great as well and never felt weird at all.

"
11104,273,Beautiful & very peaceful! Thank you for a lovely stay! Will definitely book again!!
11105,273,Excellent!!! So perfect for me! Highly recommend!
11106,273,This is a great place. 5 minute drive from the hospital. quiet. I can't say enough good things. I have stayed many times.
11107,273,Thanks so much Corey! You were a pleasure to host. Best Wishes
11108,273,great place.
11109,273,great stay. will stay again
11110,273,great stay. best stay in town for travel nurses working at ecu health. have alread booked 4 more stays
11111,273,Thanks Corey! We love having you stay. Marley says you’re the best guest yet!
11112,273,Great place. Have booked several more stays.
11113,273,Great place and convenient.
11114,273,Great place!
11115,273,"Trisha's place was clean, comfortable, and quiet. As long as you're not allergic to cats or dogs, and/or you do not need to be close to downtown, I would recommend it."
11116,273,"As a fellow airbnb host, I am rather surprised to receive 4 stars from this guest. I did not leave a review for her because her communication wasn’t great, nor did she check in during designated times. Instead, she went out to eat and came very late. I would have rather had her check in when she arrived in town, and then gone out instead of having me wait up. I think I’ll stick to my regular guests."
11117,273,Always great staying at Trisha’s!
11118,273,Great place. Easy to find. 5 minutes from my hospital. She has 2 German Shepard and 2 cats. pets were friendly. clear communication. have already booked several more stays.
11119,273,"Nice- Clean & Quiet, VERY Comfortable.

I DEFINITELY Recommend."
11120,273,"This was our first reservation for an Airbnb and it was better than expected. We had an unfortunate unplanned visit but this part of our trip made it worthwhile. Trisha was an awesome host, she was flexible from the first contact. We felt safe and at home, she was very accommodating with everything. The app was easy to navigate and communication was stress free. We would do this again if needed with no hesitation. Thank you Trisha!!"
11121,273,Trisha was a very great host ☺️. My stay was not only peaceful but I felt right at home 😁
11122,273,I’m glad you felt at home! My goal is to make my guests feel comfortable.. not to mention the 🐶 loved you!
11123,273,"Trisha’s place is fantastic. My brother and I were in town for one night for a show in downtown Greenville. The room was perfect for our brief stay. The bed is super comfortable, and the bathroom and shower are great. Trisha was easy to communicate with when we were running late and very accommodating. Hung out with us in her sun room and poured us a glass of wine, and encouraged us to hang out there after the show. She had coffee ready for us in the morning and called me when our Uber driver returned something I’d left in the car the previous night so we could come and get it. She has two sweet dogs who hung out with us and I was greeted by her cute cats in the morning which really made my day. Awesome host with a beautiful house, and only like ten minutes from downtown. Will definitely stay with her again if we’re back in the area!"
11124,273,You guys were great to host! I’m glad you had fun and chose my place to stay!
11125,273,"Lovely host, and place.

I'd definitely stay again, and DO Recommend."
11126,273,Thanks for staying! I’m glad your stay was good!
11127,273,Trisha's place was exactly what I expected and Trisha was very accommodating.
11128,273,"Great host, will stay here again."
11129,273,"Trisha accommodated a last minute booking - check-in went very smoothly, everything was clean and the house and room was comfortable."
11130,273,"Trisha makes everything easy. Super comfortable bed, quiet location, TV, clean bathroom. Smokey the cat is very hospitable. The animal smell is noticeable so not recommended if you are sensitive. I felt safe and welcome."
11131,273,"People are repeatedly asked not to keep doors open in the bedroom and bathroom. When a person, especially a cat owner does, perhaps they can smell cat odor. I try very hard to avoid this and most people don’t even know there are cats here until they see one. Doors should always be closed"
11132,273,"Very much enjoyed staying at Trisha's place in Greenville, NC, is close to town and the sprawling East Carolina University campus and massive medical complex. Everything at Trisha's was clean, well organized and equally well cared for with her personal touch. Thanks very much, Trisha!"
11133,273,great stay as always
11134,273,Great host
11135,273,This place was great for a trip to Greenville! It was very central in location to many hot spots and Trisha was a very nice and accommodating host. I would highly recommend!
11136,273,A very cute little place! Her animals were so sweet! A great place to stay for a quick drop into Greenville.

11155,273,"Trisha is great. Clean house, warm shower, friendly cats."
11156,273,"Perfect stay. Very clean, no issues. And got a personal greeting from one of the cats when I checked in. Keep the door closed though, found one of them snooping in my suitcase when I went to shower. 😂"
11157,273,"Very easy stay for my orientation @ ECU. Trisha is a very welcoming & kind woman. No awkwardness and she even offered me a ride to my college orientation! Everything was clean and she even left toiletries, linens, and snacks out for me!"
11158,273,Trisha is the most amazing host she is very kind and has great hospitality I’ll rate the stay 20/10 if I could my stay exceeded my expectations way comfortable and better than a commercial hotel she has a really nice and comfortable bed and those sheets were very cooling as I am a hot natured person so it was amazing felt just like home!
11159,273,Thank you so much for the kind words. Anyone who is so easy to host deserves only the best. You are welcome here anytime!
11160,273,Trisha gives you a private bedroom and bathroom and allows access to the kitchen and other amenities you may need. She was friendly and gave great advice for which beaches to check out during our stay over 4th of July weekend. She has two dogs and two cats that are friendly if you choose to say hi. Overall this was a very peaceful stay and if I ever come back to the area would be interested in staying at her beach house.
11161,273,"Trisha was great! A lovely home, and great communication!"
11162,273,"I love staying at Trisha’s she is the kindest host, everything is spotlessly clean, I sleep like a log, she is flexible and so very generous with her care and welcome.."

11174,273,Fantastic value for the night. Clean and friendly environment.
11175,273,"Perfect place to stay as a night shift traveler! Quiet, clean, and Trisha is the best! Would definitely stay again!"
11176,273,"Trisha was very nice and greeted me upon arrival. I had my own space and bathroom. She has a spot for guest in the fridge which I thought was helpful. I was able to prepare a meal for work. For a new comers, it would be beneficial to bring a laundry basket or maybe request one."
11177,273,Thanks Judith! There is a laundry basket in the closet… sorry you missed it! Please visit again!
11178,273,Trisha is a wonderful host. The bed was super comfortable. Love the water pressure in the bath/shower. Nice cable TV. I slept like a log. It’s super quiet in the country. Love her animals. Smoky the cat is talkative but he does not monopolize the conversation.
11179,273,Smokey must have detected that you were a cat person. He usually doesn’t talk to strangers! Thanks for staying with us and taking such good care of everything
11180,273,Have stayed multiple times and will definitely stay again.
11181,273,It was nice enough
11182,273,"I did not leave a review as I could not be as positive as I would have liked. There were communication issues but they were not in my control but the guest, who stated that he was unfamiliar with the app. He was an okay person but I had to change my plans due"
11183,273,"Trisha is a very kind , and gracious host very responsive very flexible ..I will be staying with her again for sure …"
11184,273,Great place.

11189,273,Comfortable and cozy! Perfect spot between night shifts! I’m so glad I stayed at Trisha’s!
11190,273,"Great place to stay on a budget. It was clean quiet and in a safe location right out of downtown.
Sam P"

11192,273,"Very nice place.
Easy to deal with on all levels.

11193,273,It was great to have you stay. You’re living my traveling dream! Marley (dog) and Charlie (white cat) do like to visit guests. They really think people come to visit them!
11194,273,"Great place to stay, very welcoming and peaceful area. Trisha is a great host and definitely recommend staying!"
11195,273,My pleasure hosting you again. Look forward to future visits!
11196,273,Yelled at me and Put me out 700 miles from home for using washer and dryer and some lint was left in the dryer also I used fridge which she said I can use when I was showed around didn’t say I can’t use freezer and I only had 5 items in it.
11197,273,"This guest was not respectful at all of my property. I will not accept any guest requests without reviews again. Buyer beware! I have never had an issue with any guests in three years until now. Left my washer and dryer full of lint (excessive)
which was a fire hazard. He also crammed huge boxes and bags of frozen food in my freezer without permission, did not use them for a week but left them to take up all of my freezer space on Thanksgiving week.
He then wanted a refund for his entire stay.
His ridiculous behavior almost made me give up on Airbnb completely. I have never, in 4 years had such a horrible experience."
11198,273,Very clean and great communication with Trisha.
11199,273,"If you love animals and need an affordable place to stay near Greenville, Trisha's room is an excellent option. The room and bathroom were clean and it's easy to come and go as necessary."
11200,273,Trisha's house is closer to ECU's campus than you would expect.
11201,273,"Absolutely terrific stay very gracious host , spotlessly clean , quiet, Very warm and kind welcome …."
11202,273,Incredibly kind and thoughtful host! Clean residence and a quiet neighborhood. Great stay!
11203,273,"What a wonderful experience for my first Airbnb. I wasn't sure how it would be sharing the house with the owner, but I can't wait to come back here every time I visit my daughter at ECU. Trisha was the most incredible host. The house was super clean and I absolutely had my own space. My room was perfect with plenty of space, and I could not have felt more at home. I even forgot a hairdryer and Trisha came to my rescue. Amazing. Loved the animals too. Made me feel at home. Thanks so much Trisha."
11204,273,It’s so fun to visit our children while they experience school away from home. I want that experience to be fulfilling for parents who travel far to see their kids. I’m so glad to have met you. You’re an inspiration and maybe I need to start walking the neighborhood!
11205,273,"It was a nice and quiet place to stay. No doubt I will stay there again Trisha is a very outgoing person, knowledgeable in international traveling and culture.
Definitely a place to stay after a long days of work. Thank you Trisha."
11206,273,Enjoyed my stay at Trisha’s. She was super nice and showed me around as soon as I got there. She granted my favor with early check in since I had to attend a wedding. I would definitely book again if I’m ever in town. Thanks Trisha!
11207,273,"Wonderful host!! Everything was perfect. Very clean, amazing communication with her, and the sweetest pups! Definitely will be staying here anytime we’re in Greenville. As 2 18 year old girls, it was an amazing environment that we felt safe and secure in! So thankful for Trisha!!!! Stay here for a sweet, caring host and a peaceful time away :)"
11208,273,Thank you so much. It was a delight having you here. You are welcome here anytime! Look forward to seeing you again!
11209,273,Trisha is one of a kind. I would come stay with her again anytime. She was kind and she even showed me around. 5 stars all the way!!!
11210,274,"Excellent space, location and price!"
11211,274,"The home and room was beautiful - exactly as in the pictures. I had everything I needed and more. I appreciated the coffee and treats. Even with other rooms booked, I felt very comfortable, I had privacy - no problem with sharing the two bathrooms."
11212,274,"This is a great place to stay. Wonderful old house with beautiful antiques, every room is very well appointed. The hosts are great, Mark and Theresa are very friendly and very helpful with information about where to eat. Very delightful couple."
11213,274,"Of all the Airbnb locations I've stayed in, this is definitely one of the best. From the communication to the amenities to the price, everything was better than expected. And I'm especially grateful for the host taking my allergies into consideration and using unscented detergent on linens prior to my arrival. I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again, whether as a solo traveler or with a companion."
11214,274,"Theresa and her husband were great, friendly, and helpful. Parking was located on site which was great."

11224,274,"Run, don’t walk to this gem!

The owners are funny, talented and kind.

My #3 room was perfect.

There was a soft topper on my queen bed,
O M G. Can you say night, night?!"
11225,274,Amazing hosts in an elegant and well preserved Victorian home! Close to everything at an unbeatable price. Will stay again!
11226,274,It was verycleanly and welcoming spce by hosts and the organization helped me be able to relax after a long journey.
11227,274,"The place is lovely, the location very convenient and Theresa was most accommodating and prompt in replying to email communication. I would happily return if I'm ever in the area again."
11228,274,"Very comfortable stay, room was cozy and the bed comfortable. There were snacks and water which was much appreciated and lots of toiletries in case you forget something. Sharing the bathrooms was much better than I thought it would be. The doors can be loud as it’s an old house, but the room I stayed in had a fan in it and I slept just fine. For the money, it was a wonderful stay. I’m working locally but live about 3 hours away so I will definitely be staying frequently. Thank you!"
11229,274,"I wasn’t sure about staying at a shared Airbnb, as I’ve only ever rented entire places; however, I am glad I chose to stay here. It felt like home, was quiet, beds were very comfortable, and Theresa was responsive to messages. I highly recommend staying here and felt safe while I was at the home. Thanks for sharing your home. I would definitely stay here again if I am in the area."
11230,274,"Extremely welcoming the entire stay, had everything possibly needed provided for the stay between food/drinks/coffee, bathroom/bedroom needs, and overall a great stay."
11231,274,"Lovely stay. Very comfortable and relaxing.
Will definitely be staying here again!"
11232,274,"I have quite an enjoyable stay at the Turner Home, and as the owner of an historic home myself, really appreciated all of the work that has been put into bringing this lovely place back to life. Great access to downtown Monroe and to the greater downtown historic district in Monroe. Would recommend to anyone searchingn for unique accomodations in Monroe, and even convenient to the southeast Charlotte area."
11233,274,Clean and quiet place to stay. The host was very friendly and responded quickly to any questions. I would recommend anyone headed to Monroe to stay here.😊
11234,274,This is a beautiful old home right in the heart of the historic district of Monroe City. It has been well preserved and clearly shown lots of love. My room was clean and my bed was comfy cozy. Teresa was a perfect host and Iook forward to returning!!
11235,274,These Superhosts are Super!
11236,274,Great experience and atmosphere. Wonderful loving couple.
11237,274,Thanks for a great stay!

11239,274,Fabulous house! The bedroom was cozy and comfortable. Anything and everything was provided. Definitely will stay again.
11240,274,"Exactly as listed! A purposefully creepy inn just a short stroll from downtown. If you can stand shades of The Electric Grandmother (and a semi-comfortable bed), it’s a quiet and well equipped stay."
11241,274,"great value! old school charm, someone who loves old world design would just fall in 🥰"
11242,274,"The city was working on the water line, we had no water pressure this morning, I’m so sorry, I’m pretty sure that was the problem"
11243,274,"WOW, Just WOW. Gorgeous home, amazing hosts. I love old homes and antiques so I was captivated. The price point seems unreal. I would go out of my way to stay again. :)))"
11244,274,Theresa was very accommodating and extremely welcoming. Couldn’t recommend her and this location more!
11245,274,"Lovely, cozy room. Very clean. The room is decorated with antiques and period accoutrements. Hosts are always available and helpful. Convenient coffee station and lovely variety of snacks available outside the rooms. Very nice stay. Would stay again."

11247,274,Adorable house with a sweet host 🙂
11248,274,"This was one of my favorite Airbnb stays. Everything was neat, check in was seamless, the atmosphere was very relaxed. Everything I needed was there, including extra towels, coffee, snacks, unlimited streaming tv choices. Theresa was so genuine and kind, I’ll definitely stay here again!"

11259,274,Traveling for work makes this location great for me... the comfort and cleanliness absolutely amazing! Makes me feel right at home. Thank you!
11260,274,"Great stay especially for the price. We just needed a clean place to lay our head at night. Stay was exactly how describe. Coffee,snacks, and waters provided. Home was beautiful. Mattress was too soft for our taste but that is a preference thing. Queen bed probably more suitable for 1 person. Would definitely stay here again."
11261,274,"Beautifully decorated, cozy and comfortable b&b in a great location! We really enjoyed this elegant home. The decor is stunning and classic! It is a great place to stay to relax and explore the Charlotte metro area. The coffee and water bottles were much appreciated, especially on Christmas morning when nothing was open. We hope to be back and stay in one of the other rooms--they're all distinct and tastefully decorated. Definitely a top notch place to say!"
11262,274,"I love staying in this gorgeous home, and the family is fantastic"
11263,274,I always love staying here

11274,274,"When staying in Monroe, this location and home is top notch and unmatched."
11275,274,"The decor overall is really well done. Very cute. There was a pink bathroom that was amazing. I had a great stay overall. For those with back pain that need to sleep on a firmer mattress, bedroom 3 has a very cushy memory topper that is removable. Had a great night of sleep."
11276,274,Needed a place to stay while my house was being worked on so that I could sleep during the day. Theresa's house was perfect and allowed me to get The rest I needed... Very clean quiet area and a wonderful Victorian home that had plenty of things to look at and enjoy from a time gone by.
11277,274,I would surely recommend. Loved their hospitality :)
11278,274,The house is absolutely stunning. The hosts were so hospitable. The stay was a dream. You won’t regret booking this place.
11279,274,"I was not expecting the Elegance of Theresa and David’s historical home. Their customer service, cleanliness, assistance with luggage, prompt communication, willingness to go above and beyond was very kind. My 2nd time booking an AIRBNB. SUPERB!!!!

Theresa, offered me bar b que, provided (unlimited) good coffee, snacks, water etc. I truly, did not have to leave my room, once I arrived!!

Definitely, book this (King&Queen) getaway! Also, kid friendly!

In closing, always made sure, I was good.

I truly, appreciate🙏🏾"
11280,274,Great house and great hosts!
11281,274,"it was a very comfortable and welcoming place would stay again. Theresa made sure my entrance would be safe after a long delayed flight, her communication was top notch."
11282,274,We stayed here for one night and it was amazing. Theresa is the consumate hostess. The house it's self is immaculately decorated. We loved having two guests bathrooms as were heading for a show and both needed to get ready at the same time. There is coffee and water as well as snacks for guests. I was even lucky enough to meet the residence cat. The home is located within the historic district so take the time to enjoya stroll if you have the time. This was our first Air BNB experience and it was definitely a positive experience.
11283,274,I found this to be the ideal home for me to stay during my visit back to my former home town.
11284,274,Excellent Airbnb! So happy with my decision to stay here!! The photos don’t do the house justice! It is stunning especially if you appreciate Victorian style. Theresa was an excellent host. Very accommodating and considerate or what people might need. She gives very clear and helpful instructions for entering the house! Would 100% stay there again
11285,274,This bedroom was great. The whole setup is very nice and convenient. I felt very comfortable and the amenities were great.
11286,274,This was our first BnB vacation and we were not disappointed. Thank you for opening your beautiful home to us.

11290,274,A hidden gem! You will definitely enjoy your stay in this amazing home. One of Monroe NC’s historic treasures.
11291,274,Theresa's place is absolutely wonderful. They were super accomodating and responsive. The place is very clean and comfortable and located in a great location. Thank you so much for being such wondeful hosts.

Most importantly, Oscar is a great host and a great person. I booked late, and he was able to accommodate my request with no issues.

Then, I had an unexpected family emergency. I had to leave my bags after checkout, and Oscar didn't charge me. He only offered support.

11352,275,"I Stayed here for 2 nights. Oscar was very helpful and assisted me with any questions or concerns I had. The area is in a convenient safe location and lighting while parking in the driveway gave me a better peace of mind at night. Also, the room and bathroom were shiny clean; No odor or nasty stains anywhere. Still the best thing for me was probably the comfy foam mattress. I was knocked out few min each time after laying down. Lastly, the AC was just right temp. So If you just need a quiet place to crash for few days/nights, I would recommend staying here."

11390,275,Oscars house was extremely clean and neat and was close to town. It was a perfect stay for me and my boyfriend and I highly recommend his place. He also gave me good recommendations for dinner after I checked in late and the house felt very spacious and comfortable.

11397,275,"I don’t even know where to begin. I cannot absolutely thank Oscar enough for being extremely prompt for last minute help when another host was unresponsive. He had the room ready upon messaging within 30 minutes and even offered me breakfast and coffee in the morning before he left for work when I was awake getting ready to leave to a nearby drop zone in the early hours of the morning. I am a licensed skydiver and soon to be nurse and he made me feel at home and I would absolutely highly recommend and stay here again. I really appreciate his communication and dedication on making a smooth transition to his place much more efficient so I can get a shower and some rest. Thank you Oscar, I’ll never forget someone like you."
11398,275,"Beautiful place, quiet and excellent location."
11399,275,Awesome stay as usual.
11400,275,Oscar is an outstanding host! His accommodations are so clean and quiet. I always enjoy staying there and get great rest. I highly recommend!
11401,275,"Stayed at Oscar’s 13weekends as a med traveler and not a single problem. It was clean, safe, and updated. Very comfy large bed and big smart tv to get all the rest you need. It does have a shared bath but it was always very clean.

Oscar also gave me extra fresh eggs from his chickens for free! I Will miss Oscar and his welcoming home very much, was a great long term stay."
11402,275,"Clean room, comfy bed, great host!"
11403,276,"If you are looking to get away from everything and love to camp, this is the best campsite you can find. Feet away from merging waterfalls and most amazing mountainess surroundings. Far away from the busy city. Perfect get away if you want seclusion. The campsite is very well maintained and laid out."
11404,276,Heartstone is truly amazing! Brian has carefully thought of everything that you would need to have a nice stay! It rained all weekend but we didn't care! Who could when you are sitting in paradise! This is the second have been to one of Brian's spots and we can't wait to come back again in the spring! Until next time!
11405,276,Great spot! Really secluded! Super romantic and dreamy looking 😍 pictures dont do it justice! Definitely ask for bathroom lock code before losing service! Will be back my family and I really enjoyed the weekend getaway in such an awesome town!
11406,276,A very secluded getaway that takes you away from every day life. Not only that but it brings you as close to nature as it possibly can get. The only downside is the trek it takes to get there.
11407,276,"Tranquil camping location for unwinding from the hustle & bustle of city life. The sound from the nearby creek as you sleep & the view from the tent was therapeutic.
Brian is an amazing host and put his heart into making the site a definite memorable occasion. We had a mini SUV and had no problem navigating on the gravel & dirt roads. Make sure you follow Brian's directions because the gps will direct you to an alternate route that has a dead end. We shall return for an extended stay."
11408,276,"Truly a hidden gem! Brian’s site is an oasis. The river running through it, the serenity and privacy- it’s a slice of heaven!
He was very communicative with directions (don’t follow GPS!), and I was able to find it even though I arrived very late.
He offered us coffee in the morning, and it was clear he cared about his guests overall experience.
You don’t need 4x4, but definitely good to know how to navigate mountain roads. Downloading offline maps is good too, since there is no reception once you get past town (I had Verizon).
Brian was a great host and I will be back again!"
11409,276,"I am glad you came, and found Heartstone to be all that you had pictured! I hope you can come back soon and stay awhile! All the best!"
11410,276,This spot is beyond beautiful! Directions to the location are easy to follow. This site is right off of a remote road so loading and unloading is very easy. Brian is an incredible host and we look forward to returning in the near future.
11411,276,"I am a mom with two boys (12 &17). We had a blast! Absolutely perfectly amazing place! Period. I feel very blessed that I had a chance to chill there for a few days and very grateful Brian shares this spot with others😊 perfect mix of ruffing it with some comfort amenities. It was very easy to meditate there. All my senses were enlightened ( the sounds the creek makes are awesome). Even with two boys. Lol. We will be back in the summer to play in the creek!
Heads up… the gravel road there is bumpy. We had a 4-wheel drive 4-Runner. My son loved driving through the muddy bumps but it would have been rough in a car. The platform is built for a 4-man tent. We made a 6-man work (my boys are big) but it pulled over the edge and I was afraid the wood corners would tear the tent. There is an extra spot on the ground that would fit either though. There is no open fire pit. Just an enclosed chimney… so no roasted marshmallows. This might not matter to you but I consider myself a master roaster and part of the camping experience. 😊
This spot was clean (the out house) and well kept. Once again… this is one of the coolest most beautiful places I have ever camped. Brian even let me use his landline to make a safe arrival call. FYI… absolutely no cell service. For miles in. Definitely use his written location directions listed. I appreciate your generosity and kindness Brian. See you again!"
11412,276,Other reviews were spot on. This place is magical! ☺️
11413,276,Magical spot.
11414,276,"This spot is excellent! It’s the perfect sort of remote for someone who could never camp in the dead center of nowhere but also does not like a campground atmosphere.
I booked this location 12 hours before leaving for a 3 day trip and found myself giving up a whole day of hiking plans just to stay at the campsite. It’s so beautiful and serene.
The dirt/gravel road to the campsite means business if you’re in a small car. We made it in a Prius and we’d do it again, but it wasn’t our first time asking a lot of a standard sedan.
It’s a really amazing spot that has everything you could want/need. I hope to visit again!"
11415,276,We loved this spot! It’s a perfect set up for camping! Every second being there was enjoyable!
11416,276,Booked this site 2 Saturday’s in a row. If you’re looking for secluded camping don’t pass it up! Doesn’t get much better for camping!
11417,276,"Been camping many many times, this place is amazing! Went with my girlfriend and our 2 dogs and couldn’t ask for a better spot! Very Secluded, right on 2 creeks that connect. Was skeptical of no reviews but I found reviews of this camp site by googling the name and looking on hipcamp.com. If you’re looking for a secluded camp spot in the Nantahala , 100% book here! We enjoyed it so much we booked it again next weekend!"
11418,278,"Great host! Peaceful and quiet, huge room. Will definitely stay again!"
11419,278,Very nice and spacious place with all the amenities you'll need. It's like home away from home. Highly recommended!
11420,278,"I was just there overnight, but the room was very spacious and I would definitely stay there again."
11421,278,The room was very large with a huge comfortable bed. I communicated of my late arrival and Walter was very accommodating and up at 11 pm to let me in and show me around. he offered me various food and drink items and i appreciated the many bananas and water bottles.
11422,278,Cozy and comfy room on a chilly night!
11423,278,A comfortable space with a great host and cat!
11424,278,Our stay was so comfy and cozy! I loved the nautical themed decor! We would definitely recommend this place to our family and friends!
11425,278,"This is a wonderful place to stay in the Greenville area! The room is a great size and the bed is super comfortable. We had the upstairs to ourselves so we were able to have privacy and be comfortable during our stay. Louis was very friendly and detailed in showing us around and making sure we had everything we needed. Luna (the cat) came up to greet us shortly after check in, and I had the pleasure of hanging out with her for a while during our stay. This is a wonderful place to stay - a lovely home in a very peaceful neighborhood. We hope to return one day!"
11426,278,"Wonderful spacious room and comfy bed. Unfortunately the bathroom had not been cleaned. Dust and hair and dirty toilet. Referring to the prior reviews on here, I believe this was an unfortunate exception, so we would come again."
11427,278,Easy to work with great value
11428,278,"Affordable room convenient to East Carolina University, located in a quiet neighborhood. Host was very friendly and talkative--wonderful if you are looking for conversation, a little less so if you just want to get to your room and sleep. The mattress is definitely nearing the end of its life, and the bathroom, which is shared, is in need of a deep cleaning--there was quite a bit of dust built up on the back of the toilet and on the countertops. These things aside, the room is large, with clean and comfy linens, and had everything we needed for our stay, at a fraction of the cost of an area hotel. Easy to find, close to ECU, and the host is very knowledgeable of area with plenty of ""insider info"" for your stay."
11429,278,Sorry you didn't like the bed this is the first complaint we have ever had.
11430,278,"Great value, great folks"
11431,278,"Great value, great folks to stay with"

11452,278,"Jay goes out of his way to accommodate his guests. He was friendly, and happy to assist with any local places or local interests. Room was comfortable and in a quiet location which made it perfect for work. I’d recommend a stay there."
11453,278,I visited Adyen NC for a big barbecue contest and I found this location. It was literally right around the corner from downtown. The only problem that I had was they didn't notify us that they had a cat and they didn't have my room ready at check-in time which was 3:00 p.m.
11454,278,"The room was very big and bed was very comfy. Even though it is in Ayden, it’s close to ECU."
11455,278,Great place with comfortable accommodations!
11456,278,"Great accommodation, it was very comfortable and beautifully decorated. The host was great! :)"
11457,278,"Jay met me and my 11-year-old son when we arrived and gave us a friendly and informative tour. We settled in quickly and had a great night’s sleep in this cozy, spacious room. We hopped right on the bypass and got back on the highway quickly and easily. Definitely recommend!"
11458,278,You're welcome.
11459,278,Walter was accommodating and kind. He was able to recommend food spots and directions to me during my stay. He and Anne’s home was comfortable and homey!

11462,278,"My husband and I were in town for the weekend with our teen daughter for a dance competition. Walter was a wonderful host and made us all feel very welcome. He had great recommendations for dining and provided plenty of amenities. Our bed and the air mattress for our daughter were both very comfy. Best of all, we thoroughly enjoyed our interactions with him. He made us feel quite welcome. I would highly recommend his property."

11497,278,"Friendly host, cozy home"
11498,278,Great experience
11499,278,this was one of the friendliest and hospitable host's to date !! Nautical room was very roomy for starters. The bathroom/shower was super clean with everything you need. Frig and freebies along with great decor/taste made this a top fav stay when i return to Greenvile. Kuerig coffee in the morning was the added bonus !
11500,278,"Nice room, good communication."
11501,278,Large room many special touches made our stay with Anne enjoyable as always. Great host!
11502,278,"It’s a very nice place, super clean, amazing hosts, I highly recommend if you are in the area and need a place to stay"
11503,278,"Very nice space, with lots of room, and very friendly host."
11504,278,"Worth a revisit, and well worth the time spent there. 1000% recomended"
11505,278,Great room and host
11506,278,"A warm, cozy, and welcoming atmosphere with a host that goes above and beyond to make her guest a priority in their needs. A definite Super Host!!"
11507,278,Anne and Jay’s place was just as described. I didn’t get to interact with them much because of my work schedule but Anne checked in with me frequently to make sure I didn’t need anything. The mini fridge and snacks were awesome! I’d definitely stay here again!
11508,278,Anne and her husband were awesome very nice people if I'm ever in NC again and need a place to stay she will by far be the first person I look up. room was very clean and spacious. Awesome folks thanks Brent
11509,278,"Anne,
Was so welcoming!! She had everything we could need. She was an awesome host. Made my husband and I feel like we were apart of her family. It was the perfect first experience with airbnb.
Joy and Scott"
11510,278,"I would give Anne’s place 10 STARS if I could. This is by far the best Airbnb experience I had. We were in town for business, therefore internet reliability and comfort was our top priorities and she exceeded all the expectations. Great location, super comfortable and super friendly. Thank you for allowing us in your home! We hope to be back soon!"
11511,278,This place is Amazing. Wonderful place extremely nice people. They even had a few cold beers in my room to help me unwind after my 5 hr drive.
11512,278,"Room was exactly as described, very clean and accommodating. Anne is a Super Hostess!!"
11513,278,"Anne was amazing, she is so easy to talk to. She was so sweet offered to do laundry and even surprised us with a plate full of dinner while we were up working late. Highly recommend."
11514,278,Can’t say enough about Anne and her family. I usually try and find entire house if available but Anne is the type of host that adds so much to the experience.
11515,278,"Anne is truly a super host, treats you like your family, goes well out of her way to make you comfortable and have everything you could possibly need. From her coffee and tea station to the spacious room and everything in between staying with Anne was a pleasure"
11516,278,We've enjoyed multiple stays here. Our home away from home for Ecu visits.
11517,278,"Jay and Anne are absolutely amazing and I was blown away by their hospitality and how nice the room was. The pictures truly don't do the room justice. I am so thankful that they were more than willing to make our stay special, even just for the weekend. Jay was wonderful and very patient, even after staying up until nearly 1 in the morning to greet me and my boyfriend. He was understanding and even offered tips on how to make the return journey a bit easier! Anne was very thoughtful and gave us a bottle of champagne to make our romantic getaway even more special. The home is beautiful and very clean. I felt safe in the home and we had more than enough privacy. I am very glad I chose this home as my first airbnb and I hope to come back again in the future! Thank you so much for everything you did for us!!"
11518,278,"Easy check-in came with a detailed tour from Anne. The room is spacious with a comfortable king-sized bed, a mini-fridge with snacks and drinks, a tv with a million channels, and a small desk to get a little work done. We enjoyed the nautical theme. The bathroom is right next door to the the bedroom and has extra toothbrush/bathroom stuff in case you forgot. There's a keurig in the kitchen with a huge variety of coffee and hot cocoa selections, and Anne even offered us some breakfast in the morning. We will definitely be booking her place for future stays if it's free!"
11519,278,My 12 year old son and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Anne's place. The suite was lovely with lots of nautical touches and unexpected amenities like a stocked mini frig and extra snacks. The place was spotless and Anne was a terrific host. We will definitely be back!
11520,278,"Anne was very responsive, thoughtful, and professional. Like she advertised: superhost! The room was very clean and stylish, roomy and very good value!"
11521,278,Anne's place was amazing! She was very hospitable and she offered us tea and coffee and the put my clothes in the dryer. She was very understanding when I had a accident in her kitchen and I was so nervous but she was so relaxed and understanding. She's very accessible and easy to communicate with the room is very very large the pictures do not do it justice the bed is also very large and the space is a very comfortable for any couple or solo person. Her home is very comfortable and very inviting and she was the highlight of a difficult week for me. I am currently a travel nurse and I would say that her place is worth the price because she goes above and beyond and it's a very much a home-away-from-home atmosphere.
11522,278,Everything was amazing. Very clean and quiet. Thanks anne. Ill definitely be back.
11523,278,My first experience with AirBNB was amazing due to the above and beyond hospitality of Anne. She provided everything and so much more. Definitely recommend and will be using her in the future!
11524,278,They were great hosts! Anne went out of her way to make sure that I was comfortable and had everything I needed.
11525,278,Extremely friendly superhost Anne goes above and beyond to offer you the amenities of home. Quiet quaint little town that is extremely convenient to both ECU and Kinston. Perfect location to stay when visiting your college student then to head to dinner at the Chef and the Farmer. Close enough to everything yet private and out of the hustle.
11526,278,"Anne's place was very comfortable and she is an amazing host! Attentive, kind, easy and eager to please. I really enjoyed my two day stay. She truly goes above and beyond for her guests!"
11527,278,"We headed to NC to meet up with an old friend and stop in at the Boiler Room. We spent 2 nights at Anne's home. The king sized bed is what was my draw, and it was perfect. Anne is a very friendly woman and had taken steps to have snacks and whatever we might have needed."
11528,278,"Our stay was wonderful. The room was clean and comfortable (not to mention LARGE!) Our trip was a last minute anniversary get away and Anne was so gracious and quick to get back to us even though I booked the same day as our arrival. Check was easy. Anne was out of town but Jay greeted us and we found out we are from the same area of the country. By same area, I mean within about 15 miles! Anne went out of her way making our stay great. She even asked us what she could do to make our stay better, if we had any suggestions. What great hospitality! She even had fresh muffins made for our trip on the day we left but we forgot to grab them on the way out! We would definitely stay again if we are in the area. Thank you Anne and Jay!"
11529,282,"Freddie was super helpful and responsive, and the amount of amenities available was excellent considering the low price point for the stay. Only issue was that there was a dog loose all night that did bark a lot, but it was friendly and didn’t actually bother anything. Otherwise it was a great spot and we would definitely stay again!"
11530,282,Freddie was a great host. He greeted us upon arrival and was super friendly and informative. We enjoyed meeting some of the other campers. There was plenty of space to spread out! The hot shower and barn bathrooms were a major plus. We will definitely be back.
11531,282,A beautiful Piece of land to stay at for the night! We camped out in the field where there were PLENTY of stars to admire and lots of quiet. A perfect night away to decompress ❤️
11532,282,Went primitive camping down on the edge of the wood line. Was exactly what we were looking for. Very much enjoyed the privacy. Freddie was very nice and laid back. Definitely would do it again.
11533,282,"A beautiful place to camp, with the fire pit and firewood close at hand. A nice quiet place to read and think and pray.

I was surprised by the number of amenities listed that were not currently available - like shower, fridge, stove, and microwave. Though not a big problem to me, these listed amenities might be necessities for other campers.

Word to the wise - be sure you confirm with Freddie what is and what is not currently working in the kitchen and bathroom. There is a very clean port-o-pottie on site, and a garden hose for clean water, and that was fine with me, but first write to Freddie - maybe everything will be fixed by the time you arrive!

I enjoyed myself immensely - I hope you will too!"
11534,282,"Wonderful host, exactly what we were looking for! Will definitely stay again when back on the area!"
11535,282,Nice are. Very spacious
11536,282,"Freddie was a very kind host. We camped in the field, cooked dinner at the firepit, and had a great time! If you're looking for a fun, unique adventure, I would recommend camping here!"
11537,282,One of the best camping experiences I’ve had! Freddie was a great host and lets you camp anywhere you want to on the property. He has a full kitchen and bathroom that you are able to use as apart of the camping area and the grounds are very well maintained and peaceful. Cant recommend this place enough!! Go here!! :)
11538,282,"My husband and I stayed here two days and it fit our needs for a short trip. Freddie had some great local tips and we spent one day at a nearby lake he recommended. All the food we had in Ablemare was some of the best I’ve had in N.C. from the doughnuts to the pad Thai. Bring your own essentials (coffee, creamer, tea kettle, cooking oil etc). Sweet family and super friendly pups on the grounds as well."
11539,282,"Beautiful land and quaint campsite about an hour from
Charlotte. Freddie was welcoming and helpful with questions.

Kitchen, bathrooms and shower is communal but very convenient to have. Met a few other nice campers on our stay but never had an issue feeling like we were entirely alone.

Will be coming back for this great Airbnb"
11540,282,"Freddie and his wife were so thoughtful and kind making our group of 2 adults and 9 kids feel comfortable and welcome. We camped in tents, cooked, bonfire and more. Highly recommend"
11541,282,"My husband and I had a strong urge to camp this fall and finally found a weekend without rain in the forecast (but definitely still chilly!). Unfortunately, the state parks were full this weekend and so we turned to Airbnb for possibilities. We thankfully came across Freddie's listing, I was curious by the listing - camping on someone's property? A barn with a full kitchen? As someone who is used to straight-up camping with no frills...Freddie's property blew our expectations out of the water. Mind you, it's still camping - but you have abundant space on the property to choose from (so you're not right up next to other campers). The bathrooms were clean and stocked - and the kitchen - I mean, how often do you have access to a full refrigerator, two sinks, a full stove, dishes, utensils, towels...he had everything you could ever need. It was like camping with a luxurious touch. Suffice to say, we will absolutely be back - a bonus feature - the property is less than 10 minutes away from Morrow Mountain. Thank you for hosting us! :)"
11542,282,A return visit for me. Enjoyable stay.
11543,282,Really great location. Freddie is a wonderful host and his place has great amenities just like a campground.
11544,282,"Enjoyed hammock camping here. The bathrooms were great, and the stove made cooking easier. Thanks!"
11545,282,"This rustic barn was such an amazing addition to our camping trip. With a hot shower, 2 toilets, 2 sinks, full stove and fridge and lots of fun stuff to do this place is a no brainer. Please do not go expecting a sparkling clean hotel experience. The kitchen and bathrooms are lovingly installed in a dirt floor barn but that is honestly part of the charm! This is a step above and beyond camping with all extra amenities that make it less work and more fun. Freddie was an excellent host and very welcoming and responsive to all our questions. The tents we rented from him were in great shape and so very clean! Even though we only live an hour away we definitely plan on coming back at least 2 more times before winter."
11546,282,"Absolutely beautiful
This is what it says...camping, if there are any negative reviews I think it's because they were looking for something else.... saying that, it was one of the BEST camping experiences Ihave had. It was quiet, secluded, and the views were GORGEOUS.
We had an absolute blast and freddies wife(sorry! dont remember name!) is an absolute angel. They have country knick knacks and little things that just really add to it. It was very comfortable here and very hospitable. For our first experience doing air b&b, we couldnt be happier"
11547,282,Great place to stay in Albemarle! A VERY unique and fun experience.
11548,282,"Freddie and his wife are great people love the uniqueness of the location and the prices are amazing! It’s only a few minute drive to Uwharrie National Forest and was wonderful coming back to a hot shower, full kitchen 2 baths & dining area while staying in our rooftop tent. All this built into the barn for such a great rustic feel to it! Try it I believe you’re going to love it as well"
11549,282,it was a nice place
11550,282,"This was absolutely what we were looking for! Great get away from Charlotte with convenient amenities and wonderful hospitality. Will definitely be back very soon!
Anyone looking for camping with the specialties of a kitchen and full working bathroom; this is your spot!"
11551,291,"Such a great spot, not in the middle of nowhere but had the right amount of that feeling at night. So peaceful, and Jean and Butch were very nice. Had a handful of great conversation, and they helped me with lots of areas feedback, as I am looking to move to NC from PA. I felt very at home and wouldn't think twice to book again. BTW, their dogs are so friendly and Cassie is such a sweet and gentle dog!"
11552,291,Very secluded area but the host was hospitable would recommend
11553,291,The atmosphere is great. It really feels like a home away from home!
11554,291,"I instantly felt right at home with Jean and Butch. Very friendly, had all the amenities I needed for my brief stay, and my room was fresh and clean."
11555,291,"Jean went out of her way to make me feel welcome and ensure I had everything I needed. The bed was comfortable and the wifi what I needed. It was, as advertised, a country location that was conveniently located on my way from VA to SC, with easy access to the highway. As others have mentioned, you need to be comfortable knowing that you are staying in a private room off a hallway where others might pass your door and be sharing the bathroom, which is right next to your room."
11556,291,"Jean and bill were so friendly and the adorable sweet puppies were the cherry on top!
The room was clean and it was only a 10 minute Uber to downtown!
If we come back to greensborough we’ll definitely stay with them again!"
11557,291,I felt at home. Close to a lot in Greensboro.
11558,291,"Jean's place was as described. The bed was comfortable, especially the nice linen sheets. She left plenty of towels and toiletries. She was friendly, as were CassieAnn and Honey. The only issue we had was the bathroom. It wasn't that clean. There were spiderwebs in the corners, the toilet was dirty, the sink drained slowly, and the heat light in the shower was rusty. Once mentioned to Jean, she said she'd addresstheissues. Other than that, we had a great stay."
11559,291,Jean was a great host! She was understanding when we arrived late in the night and her place was great. Would recommend staying here!
11560,291,"Clean and simple, with a kind host and dogs!"
11561,291,"wonderful people
great stay"
11562,291,A nice shared space with a lovely host and super friendly dogs!
11563,291,"Jean was kind and helpful. The room is locked but a part of a public space in that there are people in the kitchen, hallway and the shared bath. As long as the renter understands that they will be part of the family, in a sense, the space is excellent. The puppies are a clear and wonderful addition, and made my entire stay. I loved them!! :) :)"
11564,291,"Jean gives a speedy reply, I could get the information I need fast enough. Also, the house is beautiful and the people are nice."
11565,293,"Again, a wonderful stay. I will really miss the beautiful view and the peaceful surroundings."
11566,293,Beautiful view and very peaceful. As a traveling professional it was perfect. I extended my stay an additional week - very cozy and just the right amount of space. Highly recommend.
11567,293,"Great place, quiet and peaceful and Bryan was very friendly and open to any questions when needed"
11568,293,Brian was a great host. He let me use a kayak and offered bikes to explore the area. The room had a fantastic view of the river and awesome sunsets.
11569,293,If you get the chance....worth every dime!
11570,293,Great accomodations and perfect for extended stay! Communication with host was easy and no issues whatsoever. Thanks again!
11571,293,comfortable and private accommodations and a beautiful setting on the river with outstanding hospitality
11572,293,"I had a wonderful time at Brian's place. Brian was a fantastic host the communication was super easy and he provided quick response. Also the place looks exactly like it does on pictures very easy access and exceptionally very well maintained.

The neighborhood is very conveniently located. Awesome sunrise and sunset views, a private dock and also a great fishing spot. The apartment is equipped with everything you need. The place is quiet, clean and spacious there is extra room for storage and it is super comfortable. Also it has its own private bathroom, entrance and easy access to laundry as well which is very convenient. I would HIGHLY recommend staying there."
11573,293,"Great place to stay.
Right on the water.
Excellent host.
Highly recommended"
11574,293,Brian’s place is the best! So peaceful and quiet!! I will definitely stay at Brian’s place if I ever go back to the area!!
11575,293,"This is a treasure to be enjoyed. The pictures of the yard don't do the property justice. Beyond the spectacular sunrises and sunsets, Brian's place carries a tranquility that immediately makes it a home away from home. I've seen eagles, geese, deer, osprey, turkeys, and turtles in just the past week. The apartment is exactly as described. When it's raining it is a comfortable place to relax and watch the river.
Brian goes beyond being a host or even a guide. He has years of experience living and working in this area and he is thoughtful like a brother when answering questions or giving advice/suggestions. Five+ stars!"
11576,295,A Wonderful HOST!! I definitely recommend them!
11577,295,Would definitely stay here again.
11578,295,"Wonderful stay as always. Has everything you could need either for business on the road or a weekend getaway. Always prepped with complimentary wine, water, coffee, and kind smiles!"
11579,295,Great find!
11580,295,Great stay comfortable room. thank you for hosting
11581,295,Amazing hosts and beautiful place!
11582,295,Love this place super friendly host and very attentive.
11583,295,Will definitely be staying again
11584,295,Awesome 10/10!
11585,295,Stay here and stay at the Wright place!!! felt like home!
11586,295,comfortable place to stay in a nice neighborhood close to everything
11587,295,"PLEASE DON’T HESITATE TO BOOK THIS HOME ….. This was my first private room stay , at first I was kinda of nervous but it turned out wonderful . This home was beyond beautiful & so clean and I felt right at home . When I got there the host was outside and he was so friendly & welcoming . Inside the room was exactly like the pictures & even had a binder placed on the bed with little restaurant recommendations and etc . The house was quite & again let me say I felt like I was at home !!!!! I would definitely book again & let friends and family know about this place if they’re visiting . I appreciate having the opportunity to book with Charles & Blair’s ❤️"
11588,295,Beautiful house! Very friendly people. You are staying with other people so read further into the add. I traveled as a single girl with my dog and felt absolutely safe and comfortable the whole time!
11589,295,Great stay! My go to.
11590,295,"One of the best private rooms I’ve stayed in. The bed is clean and comfortable, and the shower is a very nice/clean stand up shower which was great after a long day. Their house is very clean with an easy check in, and easy to find. Would recommend to anyone who is in town and wants to stay at a nice place. 10/10"
11591,295,"Great place to stay. The most important part, the bed is comfortable and clean. Working travel, 15 mins from Cape Fear, so great location. Would recommend to anyone staying in town"
11592,295,Great place to stay
11593,295,pretty much...another great stay.
11594,295,Great!
11595,295,They are wonderful people very fair great place to stay I will definitely be staying again and would definitely recommend
11596,295,"Charles and Blair are amazing host, they are very kind and are extremely helpful."
11597,295,Again absolutely amazing host
11598,295,Great place to stay and Charles and Blair are great host. I would definitely recommend.
11599,295,"The host was friendly and provided clear instructions for check-in and -out. There were several thoughtful touches in the room and bathroom that made it feel more homey. Plus the fenced in yard was great for letting my dog get her energy out. The host was prepared with suggestions in the area, and I would definitely recommend to anyone looking to stay in the area!"
11600,295,Thank you so much for making me and my daughter feel warm and welcomed. It was just what we needed after 12 hours of driving. 2 ladies traveling alone can be hard. You made us feel secure and at home. Thank you ❤️
11601,295,"This house is absolutely beautiful they have a few different rooms for rent and they are all absolutely wonderful. The whole upstairs is a private suite and it is so so nice, Charles and Blair were the best hosts I've encountered on the app they were very responsive and catered to our every need, they made my wife and I feel right at home and we will definitely be back!☺️👏"
11602,295,it'sa great place and would definitely recommend to check it out if anyone is visiting Fayetteville.
11603,295,great host. exceptional room
11604,295,"Second time around was just as easy, clean, comfortable, and inviting as before! If I pass through Fayetteville again I’ll be sure to see if their place is available!"
11605,295,"Always a delightful stay here. Consistently responsive, with a clean house and warm personality that makes you feel welcome, anytime. Super grateful!"
11606,295,"Charles and Blair were very friendly and professional hosts who made themselves available for anything I might need and helpfully pointed out where everything was without being in any way overbearing. The place was very clean and comfy, in a quiet neighborhood, and very easy to get to. I look forward to staying with them on my return trip, and knowing that it will be an easy and comfortable stay!"
11607,295,"Super friendly! Very simple and straightforward booking. They even included a free bottle of wine in the stay (though we did not take the offer this time, we certainly will if we find ourselves in need of a booking in Fayetteville again!)"
11608,295,Great place to stay. Fell asleep as soon as I touched the bed.
11609,295,Great quite safe place to stay with awesome interior and small nice details.
11610,295,"Beautiful space. Had everything I needed for a comfortable night rest. In addition, neighbor was very peaceful and quiet."
11611,295,great place to stay ! definitely recommend. No worries about anythingin this home
11612,295,"The room was nice and clean. Coffee, microwave, and mini fridge included. Wine was provided as well, which was a nice touch. The only thing I would change is making the address numbers on the outside of the house more visible. We arrived in the evening, and it was hard to tell if we made it to the right house because the numbers on the house were not well illuminated. perhaps a set on the brick mailbox would make it easier to locate the house. But otherwise a 10/10 experience!"
11613,295,"lovely space, very accommodating hosts, great yard for our fur-baby...felt right at home!"
11614,295,"I really liked the folder with all the info and the USB plug ins everywhere! Everything was great, thanks!!"
11615,295,Great stay!
11616,295,Definitely recommend. Super clean and nice neighborhood
11617,295,Really clean and nice place. Probably the best air bnb Iv stayed in a while .
11618,295,"you can’t beat this quality for this price or twice as much. enjoy a true home atmosphere, neat as a pin, but inviting the way hotels can’t achieve. the room was cozy and clean, with every detailed anticipated. the backyard was perfect for my pups. the bath was luxurious, with lovely products to scent before sleep.

i felt so welcome, i think you will love this stay as I did!"
11619,295,Great like always. 10/10 would recommend.
11620,295,"Cleanest AirBnB in the area! Do yourself a favor and stay here. Incredible hosts, incredibly clean and maintained rooms, very inviting!"
11621,295,very clean. beautiful home. owner responds very quickly.
11622,295,It was very nice
11623,295,"The room was beautiful and quiet, the host where very kind and care for their guest. Definitely recommend this place 🙌"
11624,295,"I made reservations before flying from Guatemala City to stay in a room at your home for one night and I left a message about when I would be arriving and I never heard back.
Once I landed in Fayetteville, NC I tried to contact you guys and heard nothing.
I proceeded to your home after hours of no response and when I got there it turned out that someone else was in the room. He said he did not read the messages and or he had forgotten.
The owner of the home was at the very least kind enough to give me a ride to a hotel room but I ended up paying $125.00 for a room that I only spent hours in.

I'm sure the room would have been very accommodating If I had gotten the opportunity to stay there."
11625,295,Mr Reyes i’m totally sorry that you feel the way that you feel but like I explain to you you was trying to check in a day before your scheduled reservation. All your dates and times for your check-in was sent to in detail. Any questions or concerns about the reservations that you book you should’ve contact me ASAP not arriving to my residence 12 hours before check-in.
11626,295,"I had an amazing time here. It’s pristine clean; I’ve stayed in Airbnbs in Fayetteville where you lift the bed cover up and there’s hair inside, here I opened the bed and it was clean as fresh snowfall. The decor of the house is a testament to a life well-lived; there are many family photos, as well as from the host’s hobbies and professional life, and they all add up to giving the home a feeling of life even when nobody’s around. Lastly, the amenities were great, and the other guests were polite and quiet."
11627,295,This was the cleanest Airbnb I have ever stayed at. Extremely nice room and bathroom and the host was welcoming. Do yourself a favor and stay here!
11628,295,Great value! The room was clean and had nice amenities. The house was in a convenient location. The owner was very friendly. We would definitely recommend!
11629,295,"Probably hands down “the best” Airbnb property that I’ve ever stayed in!!

Do yourself a favor and book this property asap…I guarantee you won’t regret it!!🙂"
11630,295,Charles and Blair were great host’s and it was a clean and comfortable stay!
11631,295,"Great place! I just needed to stay a night and felt like I had a great mixture of comfort, privacy, ease of access, and cleanliness. Nice setup! Bed was also very, very comfortable."
11632,295,"The house, room, and bathroom were all stunning. The attention to detail was amazing, and the room itself was better than any hotel I’ve ever stood at. Charles & Blair are the gold standard for what you should get when booking an Airbnb."
11633,295,Always a great stay and so nice
11634,295,What can I say this place is the best I’ve stayed in period and recommend to anyone coming to Fayetteville if you want a calm home feeling stay here for sure.
11635,295,Wonderful as always
11636,295,Would recommend any day

Next time we’re visiting the area we will definitely be staying at Blair & Charles’ place."
11666,295,"No disrespect to any of the other Airbnb personnel whove allowed me the opportunity of residing in their homes. However, this is by far the best Airbnb interaction I've had since joining this platform.

11683,296,I really enjoyed staying here! Fiddle is great and her cats are as well!
11684,296,"One of the best Air B n B experiences I’ve had ! Host, “ Fiddle” is a talented musician & historian of her region of Appalachia…she was
remarkable! She lives a creative, self-reliant, environmentally-conscious lifestyle that few can achieve.
Warm hospitality matched the welcoming log cabin. Friendly kitties, head up the welcome committee and greeted with the host at arrival. My small but comfy room cocooned me in well-being!
Perfect.

If you are looking for the alternative lifestyle experience for which the area is famous, look no further!"
11685,296,I had a great stay!
11686,296,Completely met my needs and Fiddle was so pleasant and helpful!! Great space in the mountains and the cats are great!!! Would recommend highly!
11687,296,Laurie was an amazing host! I learned so much while staying in her home. She is highly intuitive and has a wealth of knowledge on every level. I would absolutely recommend her home for anyone looking for a place to go within and reconnect with your Self.
11688,296,A quaint basement room with shower. I was there only at night so I didn’t get to enjoy very much as far as the surroundings.
11689,296,Great southern hospitality!!
11690,296,Beautiful cozy space and awesome host!
11691,296,"I felt right at home the minute I got there. I felt more like I was visiting family than vising a stranger's house. It was extremely cozy and I really didn't want to leave. You're literally minutes away from anything you could possibly want to do. i saw a few sites but one of my days, I stayed there and read. Fiddle's place is perfect for either. I highly recommend it and can't wait to go back."
11692,296,This place was so convenient to Asheville and Hendersonville and was very quiet and private. The price was excellent for what I wanted in a one night stay. Fiddle was very accommodating and had everything there I needed to be comfortable. I would definitely stay here again.

11697,296,The description is accurate and Fiddle was a kind host. Bedroom was fine

11703,296,"Beautiful home hidden in the mountains, very friendly and hospitable host plus her cats. Definitely recommend and would stay here again!"
11704,296,"Probably one of the best values for the money in the area. The place is clean, cozy, well stocked with kitchen, laundry, and overall a very cozy, warm space. Laurie is friendly and helpful willing to talk and hang out, offer local suggestions, or to leave you alone as you please. The 2nd guest in the bedroom next door is also friendly and helpful and quiet. Nice private location on the hillside, but also only 3 minutes from grocery store and cafes and 2 or 3 decent restaurants. Definitely recommend for the solo traveler."
11705,296,Great and peaceful place to stay
11706,296,"Great rural hideaway in the NC countryside near Ashville. The host is very accommodating: I asked to see the place before my booking because I live nearby and Laurie agreed. Beware of the steep climbs of those hills surrounding the property. Also, it is extremely likely to make a wrong turn ( which I did the first time I went there... ) so, read the manual rather then rely on GPS! I highly recommend Laurie and her cabin."
11707,296,Great place with nice hosts and a phenomenal environment
11708,296,Enjoyed my night there. It was a quick in and out work trip but the room met my needs.
11709,296,"Nice place to land for a night. Felt kinda like a college dorm with conversations in the hallways. If you arrive at night, follow directions carefully, lest you end up in a neighbor's driveway!"

11711,296,Great value super friendly host and the bed was quite comfortable. I highly recommend for the single traveler.

11755,296,"Although a little bit hard to find for the geographically challenged like myself, the written directions are correct and will take you where you need to go!

Our stay was nice and quiet and we were welcomed warmly and knew we could ask for anything we needed! The hospitality was awesome and the drive isn’t far from downtown Asheville and the Parkway! Awesome choice to stay here and would definitely visit again!"

If you are sensitive to noise bring earplugs and a white noise machine, these two items let me have the best sleep I had in a long time."

11819,300,"Carson has an EXTREMELY comfortable spot in Charlotte. I came in rather late on a trip to Atlanta, tired and needing sleep. I was just so pleasantly surprised at how inviting the space was. I slept like a rock, and enjoyed the atmosphere.
Would stay here again. Great value."
11820,300,"I have nothing but great things to say about my stay. Convenient and quiet location. Check in was super simple and communication was fast with Carson. The room was so very cozy, clean and comfortable. I was happy to have a fan in the room (I’m one of those people.) So many cute touches and the shower was pure heaven. I’ve never had an Airbnb stay as comfortable as the one at Carson’s place, and if I’m ever passing thru again, I’d book, no doubt."
11821,300,Thank you so much! This review is so flattering. I’m so happy when people recognize all the extra touches. You are welcome back anytime.
11822,300,"Comfortable, clean, safe, and quiet. Carson's place was way better than any overpriced hotel. I'd gladly stay here again next time I pass through Charlotte, NC."
11823,300,Place is just as described. Carson is a great host.
11824,300,It was extremely comfortable and good
11825,300,First time using airbnb and had a fantastic experience
11826,300,"Amazing is definitely the word to use for this space! it was nice,clean,cool,and quiet! would definitely recommend!!!"
11827,300,Incredible value! It's exactly as described and is a perfect place if your just looking for a bed to stay in. I would definitely stay again.
11828,300,"Awesome place for a visit to that part of Charlotte. Great location for my son, close to everything. Carson was very attentive and adjusted to some changes seamlessly. Definitely a great spot!"
11829,300,"Great stay, beautiful and clean space. 15 minutes from the airport. Carson was also super friendly and even held on to a food delivery for me!"
11830,300,Another great stay at this location.
11831,300,"Can tell Carson has been around and thus knows how to put an Airbnb together to make things as easy and accessible as possible! Super chill to boot, accommodating, convenient location."
11832,300,Very nice and clean room. Always love my stay!
11833,300,"Had a fantastic experience . The place is maintained very well and is well connected in terms of public transit and restaurants .

The best part is that the host is super responsive and takes care of all your needs .

Highly recommended and will not hesitate to reserve this for my next trip ."
11834,300,"Carson was such a great host. He was reachable, and he replies to massages immediately. The check in process was easy and smooth. The room I stayed in was clean and tidy. I would stay here again if I visit Charlotte in the future."
11835,300,"This place is awesome! The hosts are kind and quick with their responses to questions! The place is so aesthetically pleasing and comfortable! I thoroughly enjoyed my stay! Actually I am surprised by the value! For the amount I paid, this place exceeded my expectations!"
11836,300,Great place!
11837,300,Great place!
11838,300,"The room was so cute, and the check in was simple and independent. Thank you!"
11839,300,"My room was quiet, clean and had a comfortable chair and bed. Shared bathroom was also clean and in good working order. I'd stay again."
11840,300,The place was amazing. Would definitely recommend.
11841,300,Awesome spot to stay! Carson is great host.
11842,300,very friendly and accomdating!!
11843,300,"A thoroughly comfortable stay! Unfortunately, I wasn't able to stay longer, but I slept very comfortably (possibly in part to the noise machine) & Carson's reception was very welcoming. Would like to return!"
11844,300,Carson’s space is perfect for any stay. I highly recommend. Bed super comfy and the shower was AMAZINNGGG.
11845,300,Great place! Second time staying here.
11846,300,We like this place so much that this is the second time we stay there. It will always be our first choice whenever we need a room in Charlotte. You won't regret staying at Carson's place. Everything is above and beyond expectations
11847,300,"Carson's place was fantastic, super clean and very welcoming. Carson was also very welcoming and accommodating. Book here and you won't regret it."
11848,300,"Carson has done an exceptional job at creating his Airbnb! I really enjoyed my stay and feel that no detail was left overlooked and found the place very comfortable and clean. At his place it’s a three bedroom house that share a bathroom. I really appreciate the bathroom totes provided by Carson so everyone keeps the bathroom clutter free. Also provides a white noise machine that made it impossible to hear any sounds outside the room. Thanks again, Carson, looking forward to coming back!"
11849,300,Allows privacy to guests. Clean. No complaints
11850,300,"Great stay! The AirBnB was clean, quiet and comfortable. I enjoyed my time there. I wouldn’t mind staying again for a future overnight trip."
11851,300,No complaints. Great place to stay.
11852,300,This was such a nice stay! I ended up staying a second night! SO cozy <3
11853,300,Excellent place and host. Definitely would stay again.
11854,300,"Carson’s place is perfect for a overnight stay, electric decor with a homey feel. Bed was super comfy and came with a sleep sound machine which was a nice addition. There is one restroom to be shared so if you’re a bit anal you may want to bring your own cleaning supplies and/or shower shoes. Super easy check in. I’m grateful for Carson and id stay again."
11855,300,Easy check-in for the quick stay I had with a layover flight.
11856,300,"I was only here for a short, 1-night stay, but it was everything I needed it to be. Super cozy room with a lot of really neat decorating touches, easy check-in, and low price. Hope to be able to stay here again."
11857,300,"Thanks so much, man. Really appreciate your stay."
11858,305,As always our stay at the Baying Hound Campground was fantastic and we can't recommend visiting here enough.
11859,305,"I mean camping is camping right? Booked for the oddities and enjoyed not being in the typical hotel or campground. The common areas were nice, clean, and appreciated. The only thing really would be to make it clear that lighting is minimal and to bring your own(we hung headlamps from the ceilings and it was efficient)"
11860,305,"Definitely consider bringing your own lighting (flashlights/lanterns). We do have some lighting to help mark the main trails, but we keep it pretty minimal in order to keep light pollution out of people's tents while they're trying to sleep :)."
11861,305,What a unique campground : ) Directions & info are on point. Would love to stay here again
11862,305,The Shrimp Shack as well as the public facilities were very clean! The place was easy to navigate once we arrived and pretty quiet during our stay. We didn’t run into any issues- and while the campsite isn’t too spread out everyone we did see was kind and courteous. We stayed two nights while in town for a concert and the location was convenient to downtown- I would definitely recommend.
11863,305,"Very cool spot, the atmosphere was relaxed and friendly"
11864,305,"Awesome spot in Asheville, NC. Great location, super friendly hosts, amazing site worth checking out. The structures at Baying Hound are unique and will definitely add to your trips narrative. Don't forget to check out the Curiosity Trail. We traveled with cots and assorted camping gear which really added to our comfort at the spot. The site was clean, the hosts made check in/check out super easy and we had a great time at the space. Add the Shrimp Shack to your to your list of upcoming destinations. It was really easy/convenient to travel to all the spots we had marked for our trip to Asheville from the site. Enjoy your time at the Baying Hound Campground. Keep up the great work Bobby and Amanda."
11865,305,Glad you and your son had such an awesome time! Come visit us again sometime!
11866,305,"Loved the Shrimp Shack! This sweet little campsite is everything you would hope for for a rustic stay in Asheville. Clean, safe and economical. Very close Uber ride to downtown. Would stay again in a heartbeat."
11867,305,Right next to new Belgium and within an hour of some really cool places to hike!any amenities for a campground too!
11868,305,perfect little campground! we had a great time :)
11869,305,A very nice place to connect with nature. Very affordable and pleasant.
11870,305,Bobby & Amanda had great communication and you can tell they’ve put a lot of effort into creating a unique and immersive campground experience. The location was also conveniently located to downtown Asheville. I could see it being a lot of fun for a group of friends to rent out different spots on the grounds.
11871,305,"Exactly as advertised, and an amazing value. I'd definitely stay here again.

One small thing to note is that you really can't walk into town even if you're okay with walking the 3-5 miles it takes. There aren't sidewalks, and the roads near the site don't have shoulders, and there are multiple blind corners."
11872,305,Lol. DO NOT try and walk into town! lol....
11873,305,"Overall a really good stay! Price was super affordable, and the campground was really cool. It was super fun to explore and see all the creative builds. The shed does get super hot at night so if you’re staying during the summer would recommend a portable fan!"
11874,305,"Cute, rustic, and most affordable!"
11875,305,"The Shrimp Shack was great. Exactly as advertised and was a fun conversation starter. The host was pleasant, the outdoor shower was great and the art makes the place feel vibrant."
11876,305,"This was a great place with such cool design features, and little, unique places to stay! Loved the fire pit area, and privacy of the ""Shrimp Shack"" tucked in the woods. Such a great layout and design for a campground! We will definitely come back."
11877,305,Our stay at the Shrimp Shack was fantastic and I'm sure we'll back again soon. I highly recommend staying here if you're looking for a laid-back place to go camping near Asheville.
11878,305,"It was a fun place to stay. Even though we arrived pretty late, Bobby and Amanda made it possible for us to stay the night at the Shrimp Shack. The only improvement I could suggest would be to add a lock to the doors. It felt a bit strange at first but I got used to it relatively quickly. Overall, it was a beautiful place to stay. It's a very unique camping ground."
11879,305,"Convenient, charmingly funky, economical place to stay while exploring the Asheville area."
11880,305,Funky campsite. Easy check-in.
11881,305,Great atmosphere!!
11882,305,Exactly what we were looking for!
11883,305,Great camping option when staying around Ashville! They've put a lot of work into this space to make it comfortable!
11884,305,Our stay at the Shrimp Shack was awesome! The campground is very unique but we loved it and will certainly be back in the future.
11885,305,"I had a wonderful time staying at this campground. Convenient location and a friendly, calming atmosphere for those who are looking for a quiet retreat from bustling Asheville."
11886,305,we loved the shrimp shack. super cute place to stay. we can’t wait to come back :)
11887,305,"The campground is very cool and unique. The host were very accommodating. Great communication! Love all the different sleeping pods, tents etc. however if you were looking for a quiet stay there is quite a bit of noise that comes from outside of the campground. Cars etc. definitely a cool place if you’re looking for something different."
11888,305,We try and make it clear in our listing that there is a high potential for some ambient noise in the neighborhood (just like we have a section about pets in structures). Glad you enjoyed your stay otherwise!
11889,305,"I arrived to the campground late on a very rainy night. Even still, it was easy to find and funky! The Shrimp Shack kept me dry! Solid stay."
11890,305,So cute and fun! Close to everything. Loved it and will be back again!
11891,305,Will always come back :)
11892,305,Such a wonderful stay at the Shrimp Shack! We will absolutely be back <3
11893,305,If you’re into art and love the weird this is the spot for you. Coolest nicest campground I’ve ever stayed in!
11894,305,"Aw, thank you so much! Come back and see us again sometime!"
11895,305,"This camping spot is so awesome! I enjoyed my stay in the shrimp shack. I also reserved campsite #6 for a friend. They're in the process of building the wooden tent next door, but it looks a little close to tent spot #6 unless it's going to be moved a little. Space is a little tight. My friend said they heard gun shots at 2am somewhere down the street a ways (not near the campground). I heard ATVs driving up and down the main road but it stopped around midnight. Of course, this was a Saturday night in the unzoned, residential section in the Appalachians, so some Southern redneck things are to be expected and ignored.

I think the campground was really cool and the indoor bathrooms were clean. Camp hosts are super nice and everyone who stays here is pretty laid back and friendly. :)

Super cost effective. Never expect to get a decent sleep when camping anyways due to weather, sleeping on the ground/hard surface, etc. So I already knew we wouldn't get much sleep. The campground was quiet after 10pm (with exception of the neighbors down the road with their guns). I didn't hear the gunshots and I'm usually a light sleeper, so I must've slept pretty good in the shrimp shack ;) .

Go in with an open mind, a full understanding of southern redneck culture, and no expectations and you'll for sure enjoy the heck out of this place! Will definitely stay again.

Thanks again!"
11896,305,"Gunshots are not very typical at night here, but you'll definitely hear some of the neighbors doing target practice during the day, from time to time. The weekends can be a bit more on the noisy side, but the neighbors all go to sleep eventually! I'm glad the campground itself was quiet though; we try and make sure everybody respects quiet hours."
11897,305,It was for sure a different but fun camping experience.
11898,305,"Clean and rustic for sure, they communicate so well also."
11899,305,"The Shrimp Shack was awesome! Super cool spot, they've clearly put lots of love, thought, and care into making it a beautiful and unique place. Their directions were very clear and helpful and all my questions were answered. We loved exploring the Curiosity Trail and all the cool little details."
11900,305,"The Shrimp Shack is dope as I will say! It was a new experience for me, but a great one. For a short trip to get away and detox from technology and life, this is a great place to be and will book again eventually!"
11901,305,The Shrimp Shack is easily my favorite of the sites. Glad you appreciate!
11902,305,great stay as usual. our go-to place for quick lodging in Asheville
11903,305,Cool place with chill vibes
11904,305,"I will not go to Asheville without staying here. This place takes away all of the worst parts of camping (bugs, getting wet when it rains, setting up) while keeping all of the charm and offering plenty of comfortable amenities. The bathrooms and shower are all clean and nice, and there is endless charming details throughout the property. 10/10 would recommend"
11905,305,Absolutely amazing! I could not recommending this place enough if you are looking to camp but don't want to pitch a tent. I recommend taking a look around in the day light to have a better sense of the site but it's still easy to navigate via Bobby and Amanda's maps.
11906,305,"Baying Hound was great! We reserved the Shrimp Shack for the night and it was great to land there after a long days drive, especially during a rainy night. Everything was exactly as described and the campground had an overall peaceful and laid back vibe. Enjoyed the outdoor shower and all the handmade structures. Would def stay here again next time I'm in Asheville. Can't beat the price!"
11907,305,"Great, eclectic, and fun. Solar shower means daytime hot water only!"
11908,305,Hosts provided thorough instructions that made finding the Shrimp Shack in the dark a breeze. Proximity to downtown can’t be beaten. Campsite is unique and tidy! The Shack was cozy and clean; loved having the extra space to change and store our bags.
11909,305,Great place to stay
11910,305,"The Baying Hound Campground is so cool. Such a nice little range of camping options available for guests— and the guests we met were all rad individuals. The Shrimp Shack specifically was a great option for two, as it had plenty of space for our cot/air mattress and the stuff we brought along. The fact that the campground is adjacent to their martial arts facility is just *mwah* 🤌 chef’s kiss.

Bobby, Amanda, and the rest of the campground staff were all incredibly friendly and accommodating. We can’t wait for our inevitable return! Thank you all again! 🌞"
11911,305,"A charming campground with awesomely unique campsites, and enough amenities to nearly make it glamping ;)"
11912,305,interesting space with nice people; shame about the troll who lives next door.
11913,305,"We've been getting a number of 4-star reviews, that (we believe) would otherwise be 5-star reviews, based on how our neighbor likes to decorate his property. For anybody reading this who is thinking about booking a site with us, I think it might be helpful to know: Our neighbor is completely harmless (he has no public arrest record), and most likely suffers from some sort of personality disorder and/or dementia. He's elderly and presumably at the end of his miserable life, so we try and have compassion for him (as much as possible). His flags are NOT on our property, and do not, in any way, reflect our values. We have ordered 6 flags of our own that we will be putting up to try and drown out his flags... not much else we can do other than continue to try and provide a 5-star experience for a fraction of the price you'd see anywhere else in town. Unfortunately you can't always choose your neighbors :(. Thank you for understanding what kind of predicament we're in, and we hope to see you soon!"
11914,305,"Bobby and Amanda accommodated my last minute request and late arrival. I found their directions to the location, and navigation of the campground very easy to follow. The space was comfortable and very clean--cleaner than one should reasonably expect. Location is great too, making it a high value find."
11915,305,"Great little camp site. def be prepared for cold mountain weather, not a reflection of the campsite at all, more so of us being a bit unprepared and then being very cold at night and warm during the day. other wise its so close to asheville and a very unique set up making for a cool place to stay."
11916,305,"Glad you pretty much enjoyed your stay with us! Yes, it definitely helps to check out the weather before camping, especially if you're unfamiliar with what the weather conditions are in a new place!"
11917,305,"Super easy to access and a very cute campground! Highly recommend, was a great AirBnB experience!"
11918,305,"Nice and simple, just what I needed."
11919,305,"The shrimp shack was awesome! It was around 20 degrees when we stayed there so it was quite a chilly night but the it was the perfect shelter for us. Also admit it, the name is just irresistible."
11920,305,"It’s a whacky spot, in the best possible way. I stayed on a below freezing night which was interesting but was very thankful for the shelter of the Shrimp Shack. Will absolutely stay here again but maybe not till it warms up a bit"
11921,305,We loved the shrimp shack! It was larger than expected and very clean. The free firewood was great. The upcycling and artistic charm was appreciated too. We’d definitely stay again!
11922,305,"You will get exactly what is in the description. It's a cool, funky place to spend the night. There were a few other visitors there but most of them kept to themselves. This will be my go to camping spot for all my outdoor Asheville adventures."
11923,305,"This is great for tentless camping, in a really creative and unique spot. We had everything we needed, just be sure to bring a sleeping pad, sleeping bag, and prepare for the weather. Thank you Amanda and Bobby, we’ll be back!"
11924,305,"I loved the Shrimp Shack! It was nice to be able to stand up inside the shed, and I absolutely loved the pop-out sleeping area. The campground itself is amazing as well with lots of little hangout places to reconnect with nature. You can tell Bobby and Amanda have spent a lot of time and energy creating a fun and unique place for their guests to stay. I will definitely be back in the future!"
11925,305,"Good location close to Asheville and hiking, quirky and cool space. Don't expect anything luxurious, but it's a perfect for a cheap and convenient campground with a few extra conveniences."
11926,305,"Camp site was easy to find and exactly as described. Shrimp shack was small and cozy and perfect for a ""tentless"" camping experience. I had some car issues during my trip and Amanda and Bobby were super understanding, communicated really well, and went above and beyond to help anyway they could. Fantastic hosts, would highly recommend."
11927,305,"Very neat place to stay! I love how its a little hippie-esque campground just outside of the city. If you're expecting luxury, ita not for you. But if youre a wanderer at heart and don't mind rusting leaves and yhe occasional seed falling on the tin roof, this place is a great cozy space for wanderers."
11928,305,"Great spot to set up camp for a weekend in the mountains. Very close to downtown Asheville and easy to hop on the parkway. A unique spot with tons of character! We stayed at two different spots because it was so booked up, and the logistics were seamless. Other guests were very respectful and kind. Incredible value camping spot."
11929,305,"Spent two nights: First in the Trippy Tortoise, Second in the Shrimp Shack. Both were fantastic, with Shrimp Shack (predictably) getting the edge, because of more space. It definitely helped that we were traveling with our camping gear and were thus uniquely suited for a comfortable stay (ie, we had sleeping pads, sleeping bags, etc.) We probably could have gotten away without using sleeping pads, as there are foam mats on the bedding surface that probably would have sufficed. The sleeping bags are a must, though. The shelters themselves are cozy and afford ample room for sitting upright and comfortably (not hunched over as you might be in a small tent). Shrimp Shack has the additional bonus of a shed ""living room"" in which you can stand upright (I'm 6'2"" and could stand easily inside of it. Definitely no frills but easily worth the money. A couple of negatives: The Trippy Tortoise boasts a ""poison ivy garden"" (wtf??) in front of it. I can't fathom any good reason for cultivating poison ivy in front of a unit where guests are staying. I recommend getting rid of it asap. Also, the door latch system of the outhouse was prone to locking guests inside the outhouse occasionally, prompting them to shout to outsiders for help, which is hilarious and embarrassing. This happened to my wife and one other guest during our two days there. For this reason I stuck exclusively to the indoor bathrooms behind the garage space."
11930,305,"Sorry you didn't enjoy our poison ivy garden! lol. The sign was meant to be kind of a joke, as the stuff is just SO invasive that you have to find ways to try and make lemons out of lemonade sometimes! We're definitely not cultivating it though, trust me! Glad you enjoyed your stay otherwise!"
11931,307,"It was the perfect stay while we were visiting Asheville . Simple and affordable and everything we needed. Beautiful area , private and quiet . Easy Ubers to downtown and back and forth to the airport . Highly recommend!"
11932,307,"quiet, clean with a great view. Thank you"
11933,307,"Great people, great stay, great time."
11934,307,It was the perfect place to come back to after a long day exploring the city!
11935,307,Had a great and comfortable stay. Long and hilly driveway is important to keep in mind if mobility is a problem for you.
11936,307,Great place to stay for a great price! Very close to all of the things Asheville has to offer. Thank you!
11937,307,"The spot was very cozy and quiet. I never heard the footsteps of another human being in the house. The space heater makes it very cozy, and the bathroom was very clean."
11938,307,"Allison & Peter’s place was lovely! It was the perfect affordable stay for a couple travelers spending a day in Asheville, and the room was spacious and equipped with all we needed for a quick stop. We will definitely be looking for this place next time we’re in Asheville!"
11939,307,"Beautiful neighborhood, tucked away but not far from town and attractions. Very comfortable bed! Large open area with plenty of lighting. Delightful porch."
11940,307,Extremely nice stay. Exactly as described.
11941,307,"The Basement was perfect for what we needed! Very easy to get into and was private, it looked just like the pictures and was super easy and quick to go into town."
11942,307,We enjoyed our stay here and thought the location was in a spot!
11943,307,This was such a great find! Totally affordable for students on a budget and a very clean and comfortable room. We would definitely stay here again!
11944,307,Great stay again! No issues and would happily stay again in the future. Thank you!
11945,307,Private and I did not feel like I was invading their home. I felt safe as I was traveling alone (I usually don't do this) It is in a lovely neighborhood and on a mountain! It has just the basics I wanted in an overnight stay to visit local family. I was thrilled by Allison and Peter's place. Perfect.
11946,307,Thank you so much! no complaints our stay was perfect!
11947,307,Enjoy my stay. Everything was exactly was described. Will stay again if I’m back in the area.
11948,307,Wonderful space and great hosts!
11949,307,We had a great stay! Allison and Peter’s house was clean and cozy!
11950,307,It's a steep drive winding up a mountainside-- I used my Sport-tronic low gear in my van for the first time when heading back downhill! But I had a great stay; it was quiet and comfy and I was well-rested.
11951,307,"This place is well worth the value. Plenty of space and privacy, and was clean and tidy. Will definitely stay here again if I’m ever back in the area."
11952,307,"Fairly standard, no frills basement apartment. Plenty of space if you need it, definitely good for a work trip where you’ll be out and about most of the day. Low cleaning fee. Good bargain stay."
11953,307,Second time staying with Allison and Peter. Love the place.
11954,307,"Allison and Peter have an amazing place here. Very spacious private, including private porch. Clean an an appealing ambiance w personal photography of Applachian waterfalls and scenes from hikes. They are advised hikers and you will be greeted as soon as you enter their driveway w an AT blaze and emblem.Both motivating for aspiring hikers,as well as, memorable for those who are thru-hikers."
11955,307,"I must admit I was weary when I booked, the price was so good. I was more than surprised when we checked in. The area is spacious, clean and comfortable, exactly as described. This certainly was a rare find, I would recommend to any friends traveling to the area."
11956,307,I absolutely enjoyed my stay! Hosts were super responsive and kind. I would stay here again!
11957,307,A wonderful stay! Exactly as described and perfect for a solo traveler. Highly recommended!
11958,307,Comfortable accommodation. for a very affordable rate.
11959,307,"I've stayed with Allison and Peter before, and the experience is always pleasant. This booking started off a little hectic, as a major water facility had an outage that impacted the whole area. The hosts were communicative and flexible, and while I adjusted my dates for the outage, I was able to to still enjoy my stay. I can't recommend their listings enough, they're cost effective, clean, and nicely located."
11960,307,"Our stay was quite satisfactory. We found it to be just as it was advertised. The bed and sofa were both comfortable as were the pillows. We appreciated the clean sheets and towels. We were thankful to have use of the kettle for our morning cups of tea. Thank you, Allison and Peter!"
11961,307,Great place. Clean environment. 10/10 would recommend.
11962,307,We had such blissful and easy stay! Wouldn’t hesitate to recommend to anyone!
11963,307,"Nice place , wish I could play the piano"
11964,307,"Allison & Peters place is nestled in the mountains. It was a little difficult to find after dark, but when the morning came around, you could tell the area was beautiful. The place was very clean. I would definitely stay here again!"
11965,307,Stayed here twice and loved it! Really spacious and clean!
11966,307,"Very comfortable place, reasonable price will definitely come back."
11967,307,we were only in town one night for a grad school interview and this place was absolutely perfect! Such a nice spot located close to everything!
11968,307,Comfy and cozy place!
11969,307,"Allison and Peter’s Looking Glass Room is perfect for an overnight stay. Very clean, price is excellent. Private entrance. Wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy the lovely porch."
11970,307,"This AirBNB was one of my favorites. I found it as a last minute trip finds. I loved that it was on a mountain but not with a crazy drive to get there since I was traveling alone. It felt safe and was peaceful, quiet and clean. Allison and Peter were very responsive. I was only there for one night and needed to rest which is exactly what I did. This AirBNB made me feel like I could do that! I am hoping I can come back again!"
11971,307,Allison & Peter were great hosts! They’re very friendly! Location is on top of a mountain so if you don’t like heights take this into consideration lol. Bed was pretty comfortable. Had everything you needed! Would definitely recommend!
11972,307,"We honestly weren’t expecting much from this Airbnb and only chose it because of the extreme value it provided, but we were very happily surprised when we saw the room. It was HUGE and very cozy. We joked that it reminded us of Boy Meets World. The location was great and was only 4 minutes away from a great Thai spot located in a gas station. I will definitely stay here again when I am back in Asheville"
11973,307,Great stay!
11974,307,"It was very comfortable, clean and quiet! The front porch area was really cute as well! The space heater for extra warmth was a really nice touch, and the hand soap smelled really good!"

12000,307,it was a great stay! Exactly what we needed.
12001,307,One of my favorite places to stay in Asheville. It’s very comfortable I feel safe and the location is great.
12002,307,Wonderful staying at Allison & Peter's place. They are extremely nice and helpful.
12003,307,"Lovely view, great communication, would absolutely stay again and recommend to friends."

12006,307,"Great value, very responsive host and beautiful area"

12008,307,"The large basement room was clean and let us get a good night's sleep. It's in a good location for visiting attractions in and around Ashville, NC. We could not control the temperature in the room but were comfortable with an extra blanket in the cold air conditioning. Overall, it is a good value for the price."
12009,307,I used this place to stay for a halfway point during a long drive. Great value to spend the night. Really enjoyed my stay.
12010,307,Host had to cancel but was very good and professional about it. Reached out to us and helped us find other accommodations (which I think were not as good as this would have been…). Thank you very much!
12011,307,we really enjoyed our stay at Allison and Peter's place - - especially the low deck hangout for listening to the cicadas. the place was quiet and well located for us. exactly what we needed.
12012,307,Excellent place. Thank you for all guys

12018,307,Perfect place for a quiet getaway
12019,307,"The area is large and a good value for the price, the outside deck is a really nice feature and a great place to enjoy a cup of coffee in the cool and quiet morning. The unit has a small fridge which was enough for us for a single evening, it also had a freezer which was convenient to refreeze our cooler packs. The bathroom was nice and the shower was great with plenty of water pressure and plenty of hot water. The check in time of 5 pm was a bit of a problem for us and I've never encountered a check in time that late before, also to get into the unit you need to squeeze past the steps leading to the upstairs deck and you have about 19"" of space to get through which is a bit tight. I doubt you will find a better value in the area, and the views are very nice."
12020,307,"The location of this Airbnb is beautiful. It's surrounded by mature trees and nestled in the mountain. This alone is more than worth the cost, but Allison and Peter added so many personal touches to make it very homey. It was quiet except for the sound of birds chirping, which I loved. I definitely recommend this place if you're in the area. Would love to visit again!"
12021,307,"Perfect for an overnight stay for a long road trip. Quick on and off to the highway. This place is simple, and doesn’t have all the bells and whistles but has everything you would need."
12022,309,Pleasant place to stay! Lori was extremely responsive and took time to make sure I had all the info. Listing was accurate and comfortable.
12023,309,Quaint location in a quiet neighborhood. We were surprised to be woken by chickens in the morning.
12024,309,"There are hens but no roosters,and don’t get loud enough to wake most guests."
12025,309,Great stay - exactly as described.
12026,309,"Lori’s place is lovely! Exactly what we needed as a spot to stay before our flight the next day. Very clean and had a super comfortable sitting area for relaxing while watching some Netflix. Great spot, highly recommend!"
12027,309,"I was there going on three weeks. Very efficient use of space. Quiet, peaceful place within a minute of a grocery store and the gym I went to. In an area of many restaurants.?close access to downtown Asheville and the expressways while still feeling off the beaten path."
12028,309,"Great place for a quick solo stay in Asheville! Lori's check-in instructions were super clear, and I could tell she put a lot of thought into the cozy, homey touches."
12029,309,"Lori is the best AirBnb host I have met to date. Kind, friendly, accommodating and easy to talk to. Her place is within easy access of all the amenities in Asheville and within a very short drive to the Blue Ridge Parkway and Biltmore grounds. I'm very grateful to have found Lori's place. A far better value than going to a hotel."
12030,309,"Cozy and clean place with the sound of chickens outside and beautiful view of the mountains in the area, unfortunately I was by myself so it was less enjoyable for me. I would recommend or rebook if I had company next time."
12031,309,"Lori was SO helpful! we had driven all day, and as we are seniors, were bushed! Lori helped us carry our toiletries and clothes from the car, and also hooked up the internet for me since I am not much of a geek! haha...Her place would be especially great for a single or couple that wanted to just crash for the night and save the bucks for all the activities that Asheville offers...more bang for your buck!
This place was so quiet at night; I couldn't believe it;; we had a restful night and didn't have to check out until 1( we left early just to continue our trip)..also forgot to mention the faux fireplace warm tho)in the livingroom..while watching netflix movie... Thank you, Lori:)"
12032,309,"Great, easy place to stay just outside the chaos of downtown Asheville. Helpful notes throughout the rooms made it easy to make the most of our stay!"
12033,309,Thanks again for the wonderful stay!
12034,309,Perfect cozy spot nestled in west Asheville. Great location!
12035,309,"Safe, quiet, homelike feel was a great option for my son and I to overnight near family in West Asheville. Appreciated the clean spaces and the coffee!"
12036,309,Lori’s place is located not far from downtown or any part of Asheville. It is a quiet neighborhood.

12040,313,Very friendly and helpful host!
12041,313,"It was mostly a pleasant experience! The only negative thing was that wifi availability was unpredictable. That is, Lana turns it off without warning in the evenings, sometimes while I was still using it. It won’t get turned back on until late in morning, so just be aware of this."
12042,313,"Hello Jan. I am sorry the WiFi connection was disconnected unpredictably and sometimes while you were using it. I remember us talking about my turning off the WiFi in the late evening and to notify me of you need it late into the evening or early in the morning but maybe there was a misunderstanding somewhere or I wasn’t clear explaining this. I wasn’t aware that this was a problem as it wasn’t communicated while happening, I would have remedied!"
12043,313,"The room provided was great and in a nice, quiet neighborhood, and within a drivable distance to Raleigh, Durham, or Chapel Hill. Amenities were clean and accessible."

12091,313,"A humble, clean little spot in a quiet neighborhood. I only stayed one night, and our schedules only overlapped for a few minutes (right before I left) nevertheless Svetlana checked in with me plenty of times through the app to make sure I checked in okay and had what I needed. She seemed considerate and accommodating. The two doggies (who stay in a separate part of the house) were very sweet and adorable! The bed was comfortable; it does sit pretty low, which was no problem for me - but just be aware (incase you have some physical limitation.)
Overall it was a good, & affordable option!

Thanks for hosting!"

12151,317,"Great location, wonderful hosts"
12152,317,"What a lovely place to enjoy the simple things and switch off from the fast(er) life. Surrounded by the beauty of the Appalachians, my partner and I spent a peaceful time in The Shack reconnecting to what matters while interacting the elements (and the animals!) and eventually settling to sleep under one of the starriest skies we’ve seen. Highly recommended for nature-loving simpletons like us who find joy in slow-paced and simple beauties of the blue ridge."
12153,317,Lovely stay! The animals are so fun and Marlene and MJ are great hosts
12154,317,Loved it!

12156,317,"By far one of the best stays. If you are looking for a quiet get away and to get back in touch with nature this is the place for you. Highly recommend Marlene’s place.

12159,317,What an awesome getaway. Nice and peaceful and an awesome spot for a person to recharge. Only the sounds of nature and the farm animals around and you can actually see the stars so vividly that it seems like you could touch them. I would highly recommend going and staying here to anyone looking to get away from the noise and aggravation of the city life. I will be returning as soon as I possibly can.
12160,317,"Few words can accurately depict the magic of this place. We will not soon forget it.

We spent our days with great leisure, and pleasure, reading in a hammock, watching a light rain fall. We befriended a fawn and shepherded a dozen goats down the hill. We relished our meals: fresh tomatoes and basil, as well as the eggs and potatoes Marlene and Mary Jo generously offered upon arrival.
We also took advantage of drawing a hot bath in the middle of the night, stoking a fire beneath the tub. It takes about 3 hours to reach an optimal temperature, but once submerged and looking at stars, you’ll realize you will never experience a more rewarding bath in your life. I figure the same can be said about much of life at the shack and on the farm. If you slow down just enough, there’s nothing you can’t appreciate.

To that end, you can see how much work, thoughtfulness, and craftsmanship Marlene and Mary Jo have put into their home and life. It truly is something to marvel at.

That being said, the entire family welcomed and embraced us with such enthusiastic and sincere interest. They are free-spirits, kind and open-hearted, talented, and generous with their time, land, and resources. We enjoyed sharing moonshine, music, and anecdotes with them on their porch one evening and with their lovely daughter who happened to be passing through.

I would say “stay” or don’t think twice to anyone reading this, contemplating whether or not they should. But I’m also tempted to say “don’t say” — only because that would prevent me and my partner from staying longer in the future!

Jokes aside, you should absolutely stay. Experience the whole of it. Watch time slow to a still. You will not miss a thing, knowing where you are."
12161,317,"This is truly one of my favorite Airbnb stays yet!! These ladies have thought of everything to make your stay memorable and all the personal touches were fantastic. I can’t even begin to tell you how cool the accommodations were. The outdoor kitchen, the hammock deck, the outdoor bathtub…all perfect!! We thoroughly enjoyed relaxing in the hammocks, making our campfire dinner and listening to the animals in the background and our only regret was that we couldn’t stay longer. If you are looking for a unique stay you have found it!!! We look forward to coming back to this spot again and again."
12162,317,"Glamping at its finest!
Can’t say enough about the hosts and their beautiful farm. I will absolutely stay with them again!"
12163,317,Marlene And Mary Jo are great hosts and the shack was a great place for me and my nephew to stay while we explored the mountains. Plenty of cute and friendly animals to start and end your day with. (My nephew was most excited about the surprise baby deer he got to bottle feed)
12164,317,Beautiful spot. Fun to hang out with animals.
12165,317,"The shack was lovely. Exceptionally well kept, very atmospheric and clean. My boyfriend and I arrived late, which was not an issue as we were warmly welcomed by Marlene. Everything we needed was there. We loved it! Thank you Marlene :)"
12166,317,The animals stole our hearts. This is the best place to get away from people.
12167,317,"We had such a fantastic time staying at the shack on Marlene and Mary Jo’s place. It was a peaceful visit full of awesome animals and beautiful scenery. Marlene and Mary Jo were so welcoming and pointed us to some great local places to hike. Hope to make it back there again one day.
Michael and Laura"
12168,317,"Absolutely awesome time staying at Mary jo and Marlene’s place. A hidden gem. They are super welcoming and have created an awesome space full of life. Their passion for nature and their surroundings shines bright. You can tell they love learning and sharing their knowledge. We met nearly every animal and know them by name, took a wood fired bath among the fireflies, and cooked a big breakfast under the morning sun with fresh eggs from the farm. We look forward to visiting again and seeing the new projects come together around the farm. Thank you both again for a great experience."
12169,317,This was a great place to stay at! The scenery was beautiful and had friendly animals. The outdoor bathtub was my favorite touch
12170,317,"We couldn’t wish for anything more from our stay. Marlene and Mary Jo were incredibly helpful and treated us like family. They provided information about local hikes and were willing to help wherever they could. The shack was lovely, and the animals were adorable."
12171,317,"We had such a great time in and around the shack, which is really cozy and built really smartly! The animals are really friendly and it was so nice watching them roam around. Marlene and Mary Jo are the most welcoming hosts and they made us feel at home. All in all a great and special experience!"
12172,317,"This farm was better than expected! Fully stocked and ready for cooking all meals and enjoying time unplugged. We used the mini fridge and microwave along with the coffee maker, very convenient when you’re “camping” and traveling. We struggled with directions so asking in advance and mapping it out is a great idea. Walk up to the hill to use the toilet or wifi was a nice little workout, it was a great camping experience with all the amenities you need to be comfortable. Thanks again!"
12173,317,"Wow. If everyone in the world were like M and M, the world would be so much the better. Friendly, generous, and kind hosts. We so enjoyed playing and taking pictures of the many animals, we did really like the goats a lot. Rain or shine, this place will restore your soul."
12174,317,"This was by far my favorite airbnb experience I’ve had. Marlene and Mary Jo are one of a kind! The animals are amazing and so is the shack! This will definitely be a go-to getaway for me. If you’re looking for a great time and great hosts this is definitely a place for you. Fresh eggs in the morning for breakfast, really beautiful hikes near by, and the animals are just lovely to hang out with during the stay. I stayed for three nights and did not want to leave!"
12175,317,"I could write a novel on the great experience I had staying two nights at the shack. I am ready to go back already and take advantage of all the essentials Marlene has provided in the cabin and spend the day there as I rented just for a bed having an engagement close by, oh and a very comfortable bed it was at that, best sleep I have had in a long time. Also want to go back just to hang with the friendy amimals while petting them with morning coffee enjoying the great mountain view."
12176,317,"2 days here made life feel better.

Had a chance to unplug and recharge and explore.

The hosts were amazing in every detail of preparation for the nature experience and were available at walking distance to help where needed.

Overall, worth a lot more than I paid for."
12177,317,"Beautiful location! We enjoyed seeing the mountains, fireflies, birds and farm animals incl. adopted baby deer. The shack very well withstood an early morning thunderstorm. It is clean and has the basic needs. We cooked breakfasts (thank you, Marlene, for the fresh eggs!) and dinners. Forks and torch that we brought came in handy. The hosts' recommendations led us to the most beautiful places around. We loved it!"
12178,317,I loved this place its so peaceful and the animals are so welcoming Marlene and Mary jo are nice welcoming people I'mdefinitely staying there again when we go back
12179,317,"I fell in love with this shack and the awesome animals on Marlene and MaryJo's farm. They were extremely friendly and sweet. There were beautiful fireflies and stars, and I got an amazing night sleep in the super comfortable bed. I also went on the two hikes they recommended, which were both awesome. I hope to come back soon."
12180,317,We loved it. My husband of 29 years wanted to get away for a long weekend and just spend time together ❤️ and that's what we did the tiny house 🏠 was great and had all we needed. And all the animals was a bonus. We are animal people. The hosts were very nice and we got to know a lil about them and there 3 doggies 🐕. Thank you and we will be going back soon.
12181,317,Very cool place to spend a night. The grounds with all of the animals are absolutely fantastic the cabin has everything you need for a good nights sleep. I hope to stay here again in the future.
12182,317,Had a great experience. Everything was as described! The host made me feel as comfortable as possible. I would recommend 10/10. Thank you again for everything!
12183,317,A wonderful cabin and incredibly gracious hosts. I could not have been more pleased with my stay and the respite I was able to enjoy there. The bed was very comfortable and the kitchen amenities plentiful to cook with for my five day stay. The sheltered hammock made for the perfectly peaceful reading spot with a cup of coffee. A beautiful mountain view greeted me every morning and the friendly farm animals greeted me throughout the day. I will be returning to this tranquil mountain retreat.
12184,317,This is a very peaceful place. All the animals are very friendly. Marlene is first class! Definitely if you are into animals and disconnecting from our busy world and being off the grid this is the place to go! We felt so refreshed.
12185,317,Really friendly hosts and sweet animals. Hammock has perfect view of mountain sunset and the campfire area is really really nice.
12186,317,"My wife and I stayed here for the weekend and couldn't of had a better time. Marlene and Mary Jo were the best hosts and made us feel at home. The animals on the property were all extremely friendly and helped make this one of our favorite air bnb experiences yet. If you're looking for an extremely relaxing mountain getaway, then I highly recommend you stay here and enjoy this paradise."
12187,317,"This place is so magical! The animals are all friendly and roam the property during the daytime. The hammock and grilling area were incredibly peaceful to hang out in. The shack is literally a shack — so definitely meant for those who need some time in a rustic getaway. No heat, lots of dirt (outside), and some friendly cows that came to visit. I barely want to write a review cause I want to keep it all to myself! 😂 Mary Jo and Marlene, as well as Warren who was watching the farm, are all incredibly kind and helpful."
12188,317,This was a clean place to sleep with some amenities.
12189,317,Very friendly and unique spot!
12190,317,A very raw and refreshing experience. Me and my girlfriend came up from florida for our 2 year anniversary and we loved waking up to seeing the sun rise over the mountain and seeing all animals roam around. I am definitely looking forward to staying here again.
12191,317,"We had a wonderful time at the shack, it was cold at night but Marlene and Mary jo provided plenty of blankets to keep us warm. You can’t beat the peace and quiet and the mountain view’s. Along with the bonus of all the lovely farm animals!"
12192,317,"We love the shack at the ranch so much!! It’s so cute and cozy. We can’t wait to come back, Marlene and Mary Jo are the best!! We love the animals and the peace and serenity here. Thank you both so much for building such a sweet and welcoming space to share 💗💜"
12193,317,This place was great! I stayed in November when it was cold and they did provide a heater and plenty of blankets. I was so comfortable here. I even had a greeter (cat) welcome me within 5 minutes of arriving. I’ll definitely return.
12194,317,"We absolutely loved our family mountain getaway at Marlene and Mary Jo's cabin. My husband, 2-year-old son, and I needed a change for the weekend, and this was perfect. They introduced us to their pigs, donkeys, goats, chickens, cats, and all the other animals which my son LOVED. It was a VERY cold night, but we stayed warm with all the blankets. There is a space heater in the cabin, but it doesn't warm the space up, so warm clothes and blankets are definitely needed if you're staying during cold nights. There was a little nook where you could sit and tend to the fire, and the views from there are unbelievable. The hosts were incredibly welcoming and hospitable. The only piece of advice is bring warm pjs for cold evenings!
I also have to give a shoutout to the organic coffeeshop/cafe Seven Springs Farm where we stopped for breakfast and coffee on our way out. Fabulous.
Thanks for the mountain shack adventure!"
12195,317,"If you are looking for a great time in a Mountain Shack on a farm with friendly animals, this is it! The listing was as described with some extras as well. Although it was chilly, we were snug and cozy with plenty of warm blankets. In the morning we had the privilege of meeting the homeowners and getting the tour, including bottle feeding two newborn calves! We truly enjoyed our stay here; thanks so much!"
12196,317,"Marlene and Mary Jo were so personable, it was such a joy to be able to stay in the adorable shack on the mountain with the animals."
12197,317,"If you’re thinking about booking this Airbnb, just do it! You won’t regret it. Amazing little place with plenty of room. Microwave, hot plate, fridge. Bed was very comfy. Extra covers for the cold. The folks running the place and the farm were so very nice! Showed me around and gave me some nice places to visit in the area. Beauty spot is beautiful and definitely a place to visit close by. I even got to feed a calf! So exciting. Quite place in the mountains, simply amazing."
12198,317,"Marlene and Mary Jo were great hosts, and their farm was beautiful. They left us farm fresh eggs and potatoes, which were an amazing breakfast. They had everything we needed in the cabin, good for people who like to be a little off the grid. The animals were a highlight, and they let us have plenty of time with them, including petting the baby pigs, goats, cats, and bottle feeding a little calf. The fire pit was a bit smoky, but otherwise an amazing place that I would definitely visit again."
12199,317,Nature lovers and animal lovers alike rejoice! This was my favorite stay I’ve had the privilege to experience on Air B&B. Marlene and Mary Jo are the most gracious hosts and go above and beyond to make you feel welcome. A piece of country paradise is exactly what you will find here. We loved getting to make friends with the animals as well! They definitely have my preference when it comes to a much needed getaway to disconnect from daily life and reconnect with nature. This is one experience you cannot miss out on!
12200,317,Wonderful place to get away! The cabin is upscale camping at its best! The hosts are so accommodating and the farm animals are so sweet! We even got to help feed the baby calfs their bottle our first night.The hosts give you fresh farm eggs and potatoes which was such a nice friendly touch.We throughly enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back! Wonderful hosts!
12201,317,This was one of the best Air BnB experiences I have had. The hospitality Marlene and Mjo provided was above and beyond! They have created such a sanctuary for themselves and their animals and we were so lucky to get to experience it. Truly an experience we will cherish and we will definitely be staying again when in the area!
12202,317,You guys truly have a Diamond in the rough and that goes for your hospitality as well. Thank you again for hosting us on your vacation. It’s been the best.
12203,317,"Such a hidden gem! The hosts were amazing, and the property is beautiful. I will most definitely be back."
12204,317,This was absolutely wonderful. The hosts and their awesome animals made our vacation. What a great place to stay!
12205,317,"What a great and unexpected experience. The “shack” was perfect and had everything you could need. Comfy bed(s), kitchen essentials, and goodies from the farm like eggs and potatoes. We got a tour of the farm and got to meet all the animals that call this place home, and there is a lot!! Highly recommend a stay here!"
12206,319,Great place to stay! Thank you for having us :)
12207,319,"Great spot for a quick crash, easy to access, super friendly hosts. Will Def save for next time"
12208,319,Very comfortable bed and clean and cozy room!!!! You will get your own bathroom too with shampoo towels linens etc!!! Liz and her husband were very very friendly and so laid back! Thank you so much guys!
12209,319,Clean and nice room with private bathroom in a nice neighborhood. Close to the highway but not too close. Highly recommend if you need to stay in the area.
12210,319,Wonderful hosts with a great space.
12211,319,very friendly people and neighborhood
12212,319,If you’re in the area I highly recommend Liza’s place very cozy home and quiet neighborhood I really enjoyed my stay !
12213,319,"I stayed at Liza's numerous times, great as always"
12214,319,"Great stay, very comfortable accommodations. Liza is a wonderful host"
12215,319,Great stay very accommodating always enjoy my stay
12216,319,My stay was very quiet and private. Liza was very responsive and accommodating to my questions and communications. I felt the space needed a thorough vacuuming as small pieces of wrappers and lint were scattered around the room. I could not tell if the sheets were clean as they had lots of lint and hair clinging to them. There were MANY personal belongings in the room that made the room cluttered and I was concerned with disturbing. Access to an in room TV was great. There was a microwave and a mini fridge in room but the fridge made a lot of noise when running. A small table or luggage rack for suitcases might be a nice addition to the furniture.
12217,319,"Hi Lynn, I am very sorry about the floor, apparently our vacuum is not working properly we just replaced it this Christmas so hopefully that will fix that problem. I assure you the sheets were freshly changed before your arrival, must be due to the static due to cold weather. The items in the room are for decor so they are open for people to look through the books. Thank you for staying with us. We hope to host you again!"
12218,319,Great stay at Liza's place. Very clean bedroom and bathroom. The upstairs bedroom is very private and quiet. Space heater provided for the room. Easy check in process. I appreciated having a parking space in the driveway instead of street parking.
12219,319,I had a great stay! The bed was comfortable and they provided a space heater! Liza was friendly and accommodating. Would definitely stay again!
12220,319,Liza's place was great. I had a tremendous amount of privacy and space. Liza and Matthew were super nice and accommodating the couple of times I saw them or had to ask them a question. I will definitely be putting them in my rotation of Airbnb's.
12221,319,"Great place to stay everything as described, very comfortable would definitely stay again"
12222,319,Exceptional hosts. Provided proactive communication and accommodations. The room and bathroom were clean. The house is located in a quiet neighborhood. Highly recommend!
12223,319,Liza was very accommodating and responsive. It was a great stay that I would highly recommend to anybody.
12224,319,"This home is so convenient located to all major highways in the Piedmont, but also close to the Greensboro Airport, supermarkets and restaurants. It is so accesible and Liza keeps this place so clean. I will come back again to this place. I highly recommend it with 6 stars.... well, better 10 stars out of five,"
12225,319,This is a wonderful place to stay. Very convenient but very quiet to sleep also. Liza keeps her place very clean. I will stay here again and again when I am in Greensboro or High Point .
12226,319,Great stay. Liza was quick to respond to any request. Sharing your home can be awkward but she made me feel welcome and at ease.
12227,319,"I was worried about staying in a room whose neighborhood we couldn’t see, but it’s a very safe suburban neighborhood with respectable houses and all the rooms have locks for privacy. The hosts were very kind and not at all intrusive. They were more than happy to chat here and there and provided us with towels and other amenities as needed. The Coors fridge is actually much larger than it looks in pictures and was able to accommodate almost all of the food we had. The bed is comfortable and the stay was a quiet one as this couple has no children and are very laid back. Would recommend!"
12228,319,Liza home was awesome! The communication was spot on and the room was everything that was advertised and more! Would highly recommend this Airbnb. Would definitely stay again!
12229,319,"Clean, affordable, easy parking, close to the highway, would stay again, thank you for sharing your space with me!"
12230,319,"The space was very clean and comfortable. I got the perfect night's sleep and the shower was great. There's a fan your comfort and the beer cooler is bigger than it looks in the picture. There's a sweet and friendly dog, interaction is optional. The hosts were unobtrusive but quickly available. Looking forward to my next visit."
12231,319,Exactly as advertised: a comfortable and clean room at a really fair price!
12232,319,"An amazing stay. Incredibly clean, great communication... I genuinely don't have a bad thing to say about this place. Definitely worth consideration."
12233,319,My stay was peaceful and quiet. Liza is a thoughtful host. The accommodations were ideal for my needs. I would book here again without a second thought.
12234,319,"Quiet, peaceful. Great hosts"
12235,319,"Relocated to NC for work. Stayed for a week+ due to my move in date being pushed back for my new apartment. I really enjoyed my stay and would most definitely book again if needed in the future. Super host, very considerate and chill. Highly recommend!!"
12236,319,"An excellent night in Liza's home. I had the entire upstairs to myself. Very clean, very quiet, very comfortable.
Highly recommended!"
12237,319,"Second time staying, and it was the best. Definitely recommend for a quiet place to stay for the night."
12238,319,They were kind and attentive. Great location would definitely stay again
12239,319,Liza and her husband are great hosts. Everything was wonderful and the location is great. We just booked to stay again next week!
12240,319,"Liza was a super host. I highly recommend staying at her wonderful offering of a private bedroom and bath in a lovely neighborhood. It was beyond my expectations. It was clean, neat, stylish, modern, with an extremely comfortable mattress and pillows. I slept well. The area of the house was very private and quiet. Liza provided thoughtful touches in the room to accommodate a traveler, such as an empty bedside table for you to have a spot to put your things, an empty dresser to unpack your clothes in, and a large comfortable chair to relax in.

The bathroom sink counter was spacious enough go accomodate your toiletries. The modern bathroom itself was roomy enough, clean and bright with a large mirror above the sink and fluffy , thick towels.

What I especially liked was that it wasn't like a standard cookie cutter hotel room. It had warmth and personality. A large bookcase in the bedroom had an interesting selection of books and objects that I found charming. The
mini refrigerator was unique and fun. In the hallway, at the top of the stairs on either side were half shelves that each holds a cool cone shaped lamp that has a string of tiny lights inside that gives ambience to the hallway and is useful as nightlights so you don't have to leave the bright hallway light on over night.

Liza has a quiet, gentle, well mannered
adorable dog, who is an added treat to greet you.

Liza went out of her way to be helpful. For example, one night when I was coming in for the night there was a terrible pounding rain and I was assisted to the best way through the driveway and was so kindly and thoughtfully offered a towel to dry off with when I stepped inside as I was soaked.

Liza and Matthew were very friendly, informative and helpful, yet they maintained your privacy. It was the best of what an Airbnb should be like. They made you feel as if you were an honored guest in their home!

Also the location of their house was very convenient for all of the Triad Area."
12241,319,"Omg, by far one of the best host I’ve dealt with Liza always responded to every message no matter the question she was always available when needed thank you Liza will visit again the place was nice and clean."
12242,319,Very friendly! Great place to stay! Very accommodating and made us feel at ease!
12243,319,no comment
12244,319,Had a very pleasant stay. The room is large and beds are quite comfortable. Check in was smooth and the hosts are very friendly. Would recommend!
12245,319,Everything was super clean and pretty!!! .. they have really cool decoration in the room and they're really great hosts!
12246,319,"Very nice area, all good in all regards!"
12247,319,It's the perfect place for short stays. They have added a microwave in the room as well (to go with the mini-fridge). Very friendly hosts and dog! Very close to the city and highway too. We always stay here overnight on our long road trips through NC.
12248,319,Recommend this home to everyone to stay very nice and safe neighborhood enjoyed the quiet time
12249,319,Lizas place was very clean cozy and easy to get to. I appreciate how friendly they were and how respectful of privacy they were. I'd love to book their plce again when given the chance.
12250,319,"This place was amazing. The hosts and Sidney are super accommodating and friendly and it is conveniently located to Greensboro, Winston-Salem and all. Such a great deal for the price and the space and most especially the host family!"
12251,319,Liza and her husband were kind and great with communication. It was convenient to have the upper level to myself. The room and a private bathroom were both on the upper level. They resolved a minor issue I had right away. I was able to get access to their kitchen so that was helpful.
12252,319,"A quaint lovely room, centrally located to town."
12253,319,We stayed overnight on our road trip. The hosts (and their dog) are great and very friendly. The room is very clean with a private bath. It was on the upper floor so we had privacy as well. Had a small fridge to store any small food or drink items. Perfect for a short stay.
12254,319,Great stay and host
12255,319,"The entire space was very clean and comfortable. Liza's response time to communication was quick and check-in was easy. The neighborhood is safe, quiet, and easy to get to from High Point where I was attending Family Weekend at the university. I enjoyed chatting with Liza and her husband and meeting their dog (who is very quiet and well-behaved). I will definitely stay here again when possible."
12256,319,"Liza and her husband was lovely. Privacy(yes), comfort level(yes), cleanliness(yes). Amenities(perfect). If you are a traveler nurse, don't pass this one by!! Look forward to booking again!"
12257,320,"This place was an absolute gem! I’m so glad we found it. Where else can you stay and have horses as soon as you open your door? The barn room was adorable, well decorated, and very cozy. There was an air conditioner unit to help with any heat, and plenty of extra blankets. Suzanne was very flexible about me needing a late check in, and she provided excellent directions. The horses were so sweet; my daughter and I got to feed them treats and brush some of them! You have the option of having a fire lit at night as well, and there was chocolate and marshmallows in the fridge for us! The whole area was peaceful and private, and the horses were the best part. 10/10 for nature lovers, animal (especially horse) lovers, etc. There are tons of trails nearby and downtown Franklin has wonderful shopping and food. The price was excellent as well. I highly recommend this spot, and my daughter and I will definitely be returning!"
12258,320,So sorry about the fire making you guys leave early but hope to see you again soon
12259,320,We had a wonderful stay in Suzanne's barn! She went above and beyond introducing my God Daughter to the horses and providing a memorable experience. We will definitely be back!
12260,320,Peaceful weekend getaway with friendly horses 💕
12261,320,"My daughter was in heaven! The hands on experience with the horses was incredibly special! Suzanne is knowledgeable and passionate, and she made us feel welcome, encouraging us to help with the horses. It was truly a special getaway, and we’ll be back!"
12262,320,"Beautiful location.
Rustic as described in description
Decorations supported theme
Definitely would stay again"
12263,320,This was such a cool experience. It was cold the night I was there but I stayed plenty warm in the little room with blankets and the space heater. I also built a fire which was nice to sit by and look at the stars. Horses were so cute and the pups were precious!
12264,320,One of the most unique stays I have experienced!!
12265,320,"This experience was worth every penny! My girls loved being able to socialize with the horses the entire time, and I enjoyed relaxing in the cozy stable room. Our host met us when we arrived and made sure we had everything we needed before she departed. Even with less than perfect weather we couldn’t have asked for a better experience with the horses. We will definitely be returning!"
12266,320,"We cannot say enough about this place… it’s very special, and we felt it upon arrival. Suzanne and her family blessed us this weekend. Our family loved the animals as well. Thank you Suzanne, and we look forward to our return visit! 🙏🏼🌻"
12267,320,"We really enjoyed our stay. It was so peaceful and very cozy in the room, even at 20 degree F one night. We liked being around the animals, it was so relaxing. Not far from downtown Franklin and other fun things to do. Exactly what we were looking for. If you like camping but want a real bed and good shelter, this is the place for you!"
12268,320,"Was a fun place to stay during my road trip to the nearby national parks. Very good value, the heater and heated blankets kept it warm!"
12269,320,"Amazing host, very friendly and took the time to tell us all about the horses and their history. We loved the glamping experience and even though the temp dropped to 19 that night, we were perfectly warm and cozy with the provided heater and blankets. Would definitely love to visit again!"
12270,320,"Pluses: Horses are great. F uton was comfy. Curtains block light. Warm space heater and blankets. Outdoor shower was lovely, hot water. Host generously offered 3 pieces of firewood and a starter, and the fresh eggs in the fridge.

Challenges: It's a challenge to take shoes off to keep room clean of manure. Expect to lose cell service, which means you will have no way to contact the host. Room was not ready when we arrived. Host kept apologizing - it seems the last person who stayed in the room really left it in rough shape. We weren't able to use the coffee pot, as it was never cleaned. Expect to find horse manure everywhere and bring sandals to walk to and from the shower.

Overall, we're glad we stayed here! We hope this honest review helps future guests prepare for the reality of roughing it in a horse barn!"
12271,320,"I feel fortunate to have had a chance to visit Suzanne’s Barn yet another time . This place is for seekers that have a traveling spirit .🙏

Thank You"
12272,320,This was the perfect little get away to stay in. The room was very clean and cozy and even though it’s in a barn the space heater kept it nice and warm. As a solo traveler I also felt very safe there which is an important thing I always look for when traveling. Suzanne was easy to communicate with and helped answer any questions I had.
12273,320,This is a very cute and quaint little place to spend a night or weekend! Suzanne is a wonderful host and was very attentive to all of our needs. Waking up to the horses right outside our door was the best part! I would definitely stay again!
12274,320,Suzanne was wonderful to communucate with. We enjoyed waking up and petting the horses! Beatiful property!
12275,320,Sweet little place great to sleep look at stars and see horses up close.
12276,320,The Glam barn was fabulous! Susanne was nice to give us extra blankets and a space heater for the room as we’re not accustomed to such low temps at night. The room felt just like home and the peace during the night was awesome! Can’t wait to stay again 🤩
12277,320,"You will lose all service upon arrival and have no way to contact the host, so be prepared for that. A dog barked nonstop all night and despite going from house to house, we couldn't find the host and the house closest to the barn said they had never heard of her. The barn itself was a cozy stay and the outdoor shower was really fun. The next morning the host was out doing work and she was very nice. She felt bad about the dog and refunded us for that night. If you're looking for quiet, this is not be the place (unless she fixes the problem). Also, her horses are free roaming and not very well cleaned up after, so be prepared for horse poo in your shoes if you go out at night. (It was literally everywhere, even in walkways)."
12278,320,"I am sorry your experience was so different from the rest of my guests.
We still haven't been able to hear a barking dog anywhere close to the barn nor have any other guests . The place is usually quiet other than sounds of wildlife; I live just above the barn and have never heard a barking dog through the night so I can't address this "" problem"" for the time being
Perhaps there was bear activity in the area that evening and a neighborhood dog was barking. My own dogs are not out at night.
I will be sure to clarify for future guests that the stay is in a horse barn in rural NC and cell service is spotty throughout the area.
Several of my older horses do roam free on the property. As most guests have enjoyed that aspect of the stay, this is something that guests can continue to expect. The barn is cleaned nightly but there will be horse manure present on a horse farm."
12279,320,We loved staying there. The horses 🐴 were so sweet and gentle. The view of the starts at night were incredible ❤️ we will definitely be back
12280,320,Sweet rustic glamping room with most everything you need. Outdoor shower was great.
12281,320,"Lovely place, lovely people, lovely animals and great place to enjoy the silence and the stars."
12282,320,Suzanne’s horse barn is just as advertised. Nothing fancy but perfect for my quick overnight stay. The price can’t be beat! Suzanne’s communication was quick and helpful.
12283,320,Fantastic value for the price. Suzanne is a wonderful person which area deeply for her horses. We stayed with our three children. Think of this like glamping! What an awesome price to be close to horse and have electricity and water!
12284,320,"We absolutely loved staying here! It was so quiet and wonderful. The horses were definitely a bonus! The kids loved the outdoor shower under the stars.

The room was perfect for 4 of us to enjoy.
Super easy to find and Suzanne has excellent communication! We definitely will recommend and will be back."
12285,320,"Suzanne’s place has everything one needs to experience the nature in the NC mountains . it has privacy , a silence and the spirit of the horses .

Thank You"
12286,320,This was a great getaway from city life! Totally separate from people and full of nature. Taking showers in an outdoor shower and waking up with horses outside our door was exciting. I would call this glamping and a unique experience. We got to see the routine of the owner taking care of her 9 rescue horses. We enjoyed chatting with her and playing with the friendly horses and dogs. We picked wild berries and gave carrots to the horses too.
12287,320,"Our stay was great! We were able to find the location easily in the dark. Waking up to the horses was a delight. Suzanne kept in contact with us to make sure we had everything we needed and greeted us once we were moving in the morning. Everything is as pictured. There is a shower and clean toilet near the room. Coffee and maker, fridge, toaster, kettle, and more in the room. Be sure to bring food as there’s nothing “right around the corner” it is a perfect escape in the mountains!"
12288,320,"This destination is a barn. I love the horses being so close! They are so beautiful to look at! A bed,a fan, and delicious coffee."
12289,320,Very cool rustic place surrounded by beautiful animals! Definitely will be back
12290,320,"Suzanne is very welcoming and friendly, she takes good care of her guests, the room is comfortable, the outdoor shower is large and the toilet suits perfectly! The 8 horses and 4 dogs welcomed us, we pampered the oldest horse in the herd who was adorable! A great stay that allows you to disconnect by eating around the fire and watching the stars! Great experience sleeping in a room in the stable with some free-roaming, I had always dreamed of it!"
12291,320,"Merci! I am sure Ranger enjoyed the attention
My plan for next season is to upgrade the fire pit and seating area by the horses."
12292,323,"Perfect water sounds. On the edge of the property, a commune type farm with lots of buildings but for the price AND includes a bath-house!! Very near Asheville."
12293,323,The best camping ever
12294,323,Excellent host and property
12295,323,"The farm is an active Organic farm and is an inspiration for all.
the campsite is magical and well cared for with a fire pit, firewood, soft earth, easy access and the magical constant of a soft flowing stream.
Chris and his team are heartwarming and welcoming.
I recommend staying for a few nights in order to really settle in :)
the Farm is only 20 minutes from downtown Ashville which was also ways exciting for us to remember, while leaving the busy tourist city, that we were on our way back to the quiet and cozy nature."
12296,323,Great area! Very helping and great communication
12297,323,"This place was absolutely incredible. Already planning my next trip. Extremely private, listened to the creek sat around the fire and had a time for the books. Centrally located around so many beautiful hikes and waterfalls. 20 minute ride into Asheville. Thank you Chris and crew for helping to make it a great weekend!"
12298,323,Where else could I find a secluded campground next to a chrystal clear babbling brook yet so close to everything Asheville
12299,323,"As upcoming buslifers, we could not recommend this place enough. It was the perfect place to park our bus"
12300,323,Wonderful location for camping with a great view of the Blue Ridge. Amenities available like showers and communal kitchen making the experience even better. Thanks for providing a great space for folks!
12301,323,We stayed in Campsite #1 and loved our spot! The creek was wonderful to fall asleep to and to sit next to in the morning with coffee. Chris was a wonderful host who seems to really care about providing a comfortable experience to those staying. He provides wood for the campfire and keeps the bathroom stocked with clean towels for showering. 10/10 recommend!
12302,323,Great place to enjoy the outdoors. Had a great stay. Not far from Asheville.
12303,323,"has very good location and accommodation. my campsite had good amount of privacy...much better than park campgrounds.
Chris is a very responsible and considerate host. He helped us push our car out of a ditch when we got stuck while driving in the dark. He will take care of you if you have any trouble."
12304,323,Excellent stay! The creek behind my campsite literally lulled me to sleep! The table and fire pit at my site was perfect for me to relax after a long day! It was so beautiful!
12305,323,"Excellent, simple camping plots a short drive from Asheville. Be wary of muddy or heavily saturated areas when driving to your campsite, luckily we had the help of Chris and another patron to help after my car got stuck. This is our second time booking, we love this place! Dogs on the property to show you around, nearby creeks and gorgeous views. Book for a nice break from the day to day, get some fresh air. Can’t wait to come back!"
12306,323,"Wonderful!! Quiet get away, very kind host!"
12307,323,"Great place for camping, close to town, Pisgah National Forest, and blue ridge parkway. Chris had firewood available and clean facilities we were glad to have. Great place to stay in the fall, will come back!"
12308,323,Great location and Chris was a very nice guy. Would recommend!
12309,323,Our campsite was perfect! Right next to the creek. Loved the amenities. Thank you again Chris!
12310,323,Convenient place to stop and camp for the night. I got in late and in the rain and Chris found me a spot to car camp for the night despite flooding down in the usual campground areas. Outdoor shower was great the next day.
12311,323,"If you're looking for a campsite with shower and toilet on the premises on a budget, this is it. Chris met us at the foot of the driveway and showed us our site. Mere feet from a creek, it was quite peaceful. Some traffic across the way can be a bit noisy but overall this is a great value."
12312,323,Great plot of land
12313,323,great spot to camp
12314,323,Amazing location. Amazing owners. Amazing people. It could not be better.
12315,323,Great private campsite near a stream and with some basic amenities (shower). Definitively a nice place to stay :-)
12316,323,"Great place, loved it!"
12317,323,Great place. Great dude. Great price.
12318,323,"I have stayed at the farm twice now, it is my favorite spot to stay while visiting Asheville. The outdoor shower is magical, stars are plentiful, and I get the best sleep when I stay here! Highly recommend!"
12319,323,..
12320,323,"Chris was super friendly and helpful, even gave us an extra tarp for the rain!"
12321,323,"awesome, super secluded campsites. The bathrooms were nice to have and made life a lot easier. a very unique experience and property, we loved the dogs who greet you!"
12322,323,"had great communication, along with a great location He offered several amenities including picking fresh vegetables and fruits at his spot! I'm definitely going to be staying here again"
12323,323,Best hospitality I’ve ever experienced!
12324,323,"Had an amazing stay while driving the blue ridge parkway. Chris was very responsive, kind, and accommodating. My site was private and serene. Highly recommend!"
12325,323,Awesome!
12326,323,Wonderful site! The creek is very soothing and so is the outdoor shower!
12327,323,Wow! This is a perfect first-time-camper spot. I had never camped before and this was incredible. I was able to pull my car close to my campsite and have easy access to everything. Incredibly dog friendly with lots of farm to explore. I loved relaxing by the campfire and falling asleep to the sounds of the creek. I would 100% stay here again.
12328,323,Such a great place! would come back & definitely recommend
12329,323,This campsite is right by the water - so nice to fall asleep to!
12330,323,"Everything was exactly what we needed for a weekend getaway. Super peaceful, super beautiful, and just a unique little property. Even though we had one full day of rain, we had an amazing stay. If you're lucky, you can make friends with some of the farm dogs and they are like the cherry on top of a really lovely sundae! Easy to find, close to town and any amenity you could want for. Can't wait to come back!
Loved the outdoor shower as well!"
12331,323,Chris’s place was a great getaway and an absolute gem of a camping spot. The camping areas are perfect and Chris was such an inviting host that it made the whole experience that much more enjoyable. Definitely recommend camping here and we will be going back.
12332,323,"Really beautiful spot, it was great to relax by the creek with a book and cook on the fire :)"
12333,323,Quiet place to camp next to a nice creek. Clean.
12334,323,"My dog and I had a blast at Chris's place! He was kind enough to let us check-in late after I got off work. We enjoyed our campsite next to the river and my dog had a blast hanging out with Chris's sweet dog, Virginia. Loved being able to walk around the farm and enjoy nature!"
12335,323,It’s a cute campsite right next to a creek.
12336,323,"Chris is a very attentive host, from fast response and open door policy, to lending flashlights and other tools. He came out to greet us within a few minutes of arriving, and checked in several times during our stay. Our stay was on a very cold night with temperatures reaching a low of 24° and a overnight blizzard bringing 2-4 inches. Chris directed us to several sources of scrap wood piles that we were able to use for our campfire. Our campsite was exactly as pictured on the listing. We would enjoy the opportunity to return if given the opportunity."
12337,323,"This was my third time staying here, and will most likely not be my last. The location is close enough to everything to not need to drive too far, but just far enough away to be isolated in nature. Great campsites along a clear mountain stream on a local farm."
12338,323,This place was absolutely beautiful. Set my tent and hammock up near the creek and enjoyed the sounds of the water! I will definitely stay here again!
12339,323,"Beautiful spot for basic camping needs. Close to Asheville (within twenty min), quiet campground, plenty of space between sites. We stayed next to the creek which was so peaceful to wake up next to. Would definitely recommend as a good home base with the essentials."
12340,323,Great campsite. Next to a nice creek and had electricity as well! Made car camping a blast
12341,323,Great communication and very flexible. We are grateful. The location is nourishing.
12342,323,Chris was very hospitable. This AirBNB is the perfect place to stay if you’re coming to Asheville me and my family had an awesome visit.
12343,323,"Due to COVID and camp sites along forest roads are shut down ( only finding out when we arrived) we scrambled to find something so our trip wasnt a wash. We came upon this gem. It is tucked away in an area with limited light pollution and still close to the BRP and not far from asheville. The owner was great and gave us a tour of his organic farm. I love sleeping near water when camping and this had a nice stream to help me sleep the night away. Restroom was clean. For the price it cant be beat. We ended up booking the site at 5pm and had no problems getting in contact with chris. We will Definitely be coming back again in the future. Places to hang if you sleep in a hammock.

FYI. Its a working farm and looks it."
12344,323,"We had a great experience this weekend. Sidney is a great host. She really went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. She is extremely communicative. She gave us detailed directions, and instructions, and local recommendations. She met us when we arrived, and took us on a tour, and she communicated through our stay via text. You don’t normally get that level of hospitality camping. They were very welcoming of our 4 dogs which we appreciate more than anything else, and we got to know one of the farm dogs, Ginger, during our stay. It was also nice to have two bathhouse options. We’re used to camping in National Forests, so that was a luxury for us. We had a great experience, and will definitely be back in the Spring."
12345,323,"My boyfriend and I have been here several times and it's always so peaceful, private and amazing location. You have that mountain feel while being 15 minutes from downtown Asheville. We plan to return again next Spring."
12346,323,The spot was exactly as advertised - lovely campsite and friendly folks. We enjoyed camping there!
12347,323,Beautiful little spot!
12348,323,We made the decision to camp during a time where it poured down rain . The first thing I did when we arrived was accidentally get my car stuck in the mud. The next thing I know Chris is helping me get my car out of the mud with his tractor. He honestly saved our trip and I cant thank him enough. Great shower as well. Great accommodations for a couple of campers.
12349,323,"Delightful interaction, great location, great value!"
12350,323,I had a lovely stay at the farm by myself for a few days. Sidney was a very communicative host and made me feel welcome!
12351,323,"Great camping spot down by the creek with adirondack chairs and a fire pit. I loved that I could bring my dog and she could run around the farm and pick veggies with me :) My dog did hurt her leg, so I had to limit her activity, and they went above and beyond to let me know when she may come across other dogs (via text) that way I could make sure she was contained. Naturally there were a ton of mosquitoes but that is expected when your camping, especially by water. I recommend bringing all sorts of bug repellent and listen to where she says to park because it gets very muddy when there is a lot of rain."
12352,323,Had a great time staying here for Labor Day. Great location close to Asheville and peaceful camping. Staying next to the creek was awesome and LOVED the outdoor shower. The property is interesting and the farm is very cool. There is some areas of junk but obviously a farm property so we had no problem with it. Great camping spot!
12353,323,Great place to stay near Asheville! I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to “camp” near the mountains. Easy access to all the best hikes and the added bonus of showers/running water were much appreciated!
12354,323,"This magical little farm was exactly what I needed for a few days! Quiet, beautiful, close to hiking spots + Asheville, and perfect for clearing brain fog.
Sidney was great at communicating and gave me a ton of tips about the area. I didn’t see Chris very much, but he was friendly as well.
Ramona (the Great Dane) and I were camping in our van, so we didn’t use the actual campsite for sleeping, but really enjoying playing in the creek near it.
The outdoor shower/bathroom situation was even better than I expected. (There is an indoor bathroom as well for those afraid of showering with bug friends!)
I was very happy with the experience overall, and will definitely be back next time I’m in the area.
I have also sent the link to a few friends already, so yes, I would definitely recommend staying here."
12355,323,"Had a wonderful time, beautiful creek very private and peaceful"
12356,323,"The area was exactly what we were looking for. Secluded, beautiful, quiet. The hosts were extremely accommodating and communicative and knew the area very well. This is the perfect place for a few nights of peace in nature, far enough away from city life that you feel tucked away but close enough to downtown Asheville so that a trip there is quick and accessible. I would recommend this spot to anyone looking to camp and live the farm life for a while. I will definitely be coming back!"
12357,323,"Great place for a quiet, meditative experience in a beautiful setting. Chris and Sidney are amazing and generous hosts. But if you are looking to party with your friends, look elsewhere!"
12358,323,"Really good place to stay. Great campsites and can’t beat the creek! Quality communication with host, easy in and out of site, close to stores but also far enough away to relax in nature. Fun times."
12359,323,"This is an ideal campsite- you can pitch your tent right next to a cobblestone creek and fall asleep to running water, take in the stars and the fireflies while cooking on your campfire, there are facilities on-site but privacy away from other campers, and Sidney is there to help everyone with whatever is needed. Even better, its a short drive to all the hiking you could ask for and very close to downtown Asheville, and the hosts provide excellent tips on how to spend your time while you're there. While at camp we had space for my pup to explore and play without disturbing others, which was a treat. Importantly, we felt safe and welcomed from the moment we arrived. Definitely hope to return to this site soon!"
12360,323,Beautiful campsite with great amenities! Definitely will be coming back to camp again soon! Best spot near Asheville.
12361,323,Great place to camp near Asheville
12362,323,"Very nice and thoughtful! They took us on a tour of the farm and it was really cool. We loved ginger, the pup :)"
12363,323,Great spot! Don't miss out. Our host was fantastic. Hear the brook babble you to sleep like you never knew you needed.
12364,323,"My friends and I enjoyed the scenery and the pup Ginger brought light to our trip. Other than that our stay was quite bittersweet. Never met Chris only meet his wife Sidney. We arrived at sundown and she showed us around the property outside in the cold. Within the first 20 minutes of our arrival she exclaimed to me, a woman of color, that she didn’t know that black people sniffled she only thought it was a white person thing. It seemed to be some sort of bad racist joke and was just not my since of humor and was quite ignorant and tasteless and made me uncomfortable from the start. We continued to show kindness despite that. A day or two later we had a friend join us to camp for two days and we were informed an extra camper fee was $12 per night. A day before we left Sidney came to our site asking for the $24. We usually carry card only and only had $21 in cash. She gives us one hour and threatens to call the police on us over $3 dollars. Once we scrounged up change our friend walked up to give her the money and upon her return says that Sidney physically assaulted her and jumped onto her chest after she tossed the change on the ground in reaction to her aggressive temperament. I understand we are quite young folks but are peaceful and wish no harm to Sidney or her husband. Just wanted to put our story out there. It was an unexpected twist on our camping trip."
12365,323,"We gladly welcome everyone here. As with all of our many excellent and diverse Guests I was hospitable, kind, and generous to Mo. Among other generosities, I voluntarily offered a room to Mo, at no additional cost, so she and her sick friend, Summer, would not have to sleep in a cold tent. I made tea to help her feel better. Then, I discovered that Mo and Summer had been hiding a third person. I regret that I did not enforce the rules by immediately canceling her booking and asking them all to leave.
Instead, I offered that she could pay for the extra guest and Mo agreed. The third person stayed for all four days. At the end of their stay, I repeatedly texted Mo to remind her to pay. She replied she was on her way to ""grab the money"" before returning within an hour. Upon returning, they continued to dodge paying. After an ultimatum of pay or leave, the third guest brought a handful of coins, verbally assaulted me, and then physically assaulted me by throwing the coins at my face. Even after all that, I simply told Mo that the third guest needed to leave immediately."
12366,323,Nice campsite with the creek flowing right next to your campfire ring. You will hear trucks driving on the road nearby. It’s a great place nonetheless with great hospitality and communication from the hosts!
12367,323,Very personable. Great experience and will definitely be back!
12368,323,Great space and great amenities.
12369,323,Great place to set up camp close to Asheville your gonna love a dog named Virginia
12370,323,"After camping in nearby national parks, it was nice to stay on this private farm and escape the crowds for a couple of nights and have access to a hot shower. The farm has some pets roaming around, including a super friendly dog named Ginger who might keep you company for a bit. The location is great and is a short drive away from Asheville and many hiking trails.

Just a heads up about the creekside spot - if you are expecting rain, you might not want to keep your car on the site, as the dirt road leading to it gets very muddy and unsuitable for your typical car (trucks and SUVs would be fine, I'm guessing). Chris clearly communicated this to me and after some rain, even offered to drive me to and from my car to pack my gear up. Just something to be aware of if you are car camping and like to stay near your vehicle!"
12371,323,This was a wonderful space to enjoy camping by the creek!
12372,323,Great place to camp
12373,323,My husband and I were traveling through North Carolina when we found this perfect place to set up camp. It’s right by the river so you sleep so peacefully at night! Sidney was awesome and gave us a tour of the farm! We would highly recommend this spot and we’ll be back next time we’re near Ashveville!
12374,323,"10/10!! Sidney was incredible & showed the most amazing hospitality that completely exceeded any expectations we had! WILL definitely be returning! Also, Sidney had the greatest local tips for anything you need from food to fishing to hiking to everything else! So grateful for this experience! ♥️"
12375,323,Great creek and vibe!
12376,323,"Another amazing stay! Best sleep I’ve had in a while. Sounds of water rushing over rocks accompanied nature’s song and the sand was nice and soft under my tent. The best part, as always, was my lovely host Sydney. Hope to be back someday."
12377,323,Peaceful campsite and close to downtown Asheville!
12378,323,We had a lovely stay! We highly recommend this space for all nature lovers who need to escape to serenity in nature!
12379,323,Stay was great! Very helpful with my schedule. Thanks again
12380,323,"Sidney is an attentive and accommodating host, the campsite is peaceful and cozy"
12381,323,"Our stay here was my first time camping and it was fantastic! The camping space is gorgeous and offers plenty of privacy. Plus, its very convenient for going hiking or out and about in Asheville. The hosts are very kind and easy to get in touch with. Our puppy also loved the site and splashing in the creek. The outdoor shower is gorgeous and having two bathrooms easily accessible on site is such a nice touch. Also, wifi reaches all the way to campsites by the creek so that's pretty fantastic!"
12382,323,We had a wonderful time on the farm. the campsite was private and next to a peaceful stream. we were a quick drive away from Asheville and hiking in pisgah. highly recommended!
12383,323,"This farm and campsite were peaceful. Our site was near the creek and camping there was amazing. Other campers were quiet and courteous. Sidney, the hosts helper, was amazing and made sure we got there safely and stayed late to give us a tour. I couldn’t have asked for a better camping toilet/shower situation, also! Thanks for the great place, will come again when headed to Asheville!"
12384,326,Great place to stay close to the Paraclete XP tunnel. I would come back again!
12385,326,"It was a nice stay. I had one of the three upstairs bedrooms that are used for rentals. There is one common bathroom that was quite clean and adequate.
My room had a refrigerator and microwave and a TV. House rules were posted in the room.
I took a walk in the area, and it was very safe and peaceful.
I would definitely recommend"
12386,326,Great host. Flexible when I had to change dates. Much appreciated for all the help.
12387,326,Great stay in Raeford! Very clean and comfortable. Location was perfect as it’s close to the Indoor wind tunnel and Skydive Paraclete. Will definitely stay again!
12388,326,Great stay! Thanks!
12389,326,Bobby’s place was great! Super comfortable and clean! Quiet home in a beautiful neighborhood! Thanks for accommodating me Bobby.
12390,326,"Excellent location, great value, super clean, wonderful hosts. Highly recommended!!!"
12391,326,Thank you for the hospitality and being very welcoming. Bobby was awesome at communicating and making my family feel very welcome when arriving. Even with it being a shared space we barely even noticed him there. Again thank you so much for having us. I do plan to return over the next year and stay if you will have me. I do a lot of tunnel time and jumping up at Paraclete and this location is so close to both.
12392,326,"I am a return guest. I am very satisfied with everything, perfect location for skydivers who attend tunnel trainings. The host is very friendly, easy to communitcate. I got into a challenging situation during my stay, the host was extremely helpful and generous. The room, the bed are very comfortable, there is a small fridge and a microwave for convenience."
12393,326,This home was very clean and in a quiet neighborhood.
12394,326,"Great location, clean, super organized, amazing communication. Definitely coming back!!!"
12395,326,"Absolutely beautiful, clean, peaceful and welcoming home in a quiet, safe neighborhood. I had a very restful and lovely stay. The bed was comfortable and the home smelled fragrant. Easy check-in. Bobby made me feel welcome. Thank you for the stay!"
12396,326,"Wonderful, immaculate house. Warm and welcoming host! Nice quiet neighborhood. Highly recommended!!"
12397,326,"Great little room in the Raeford area, within a couple minutes of main roads in the area. I used the room as a hub to recharge and travel to square away some errands while moving out of town. I highly recommend if you're looking for something relaxed!"
12398,326,"The host was home to greet us and show us to the room on the 2nd floor. The bathroom was right next to the bedroom. We didn't use the backyard but we're able to use the division's community swimming pool. We appreciated the cleanliness of both bedroom and bathroom. The bed was comfortable. It was easy to communicate with our host and he was available if needed. Otherwise, we had our privacy. Thank you!"
12399,326,"Everything was well maintained, clean, and especially comfortable. I arrived pretty late, and didn’t have any trouble getting to my room. Communication was also great. I would definitely stay here again!"
12400,326,Great one night stay; extremely clean and quiet; I will for sure be back!
12401,326,"He's a very nice guy, the room is much better than some 3star hotel rooms.. he offered me an extra free night because I made mistake in my booking. He's a great guy and his wife. God bless y'all."
12402,326,Perfectly comfortable place to stay. They have have everything you need conveniently located in the room!!
12403,326,Very clean
12404,326,Bobby’s place was fantastic and the perfect location for my needs! Very clean! Having the tv in the room with Netflix was great. I couldn’t have asked for more to feel right at home! I will be staying here any time I’m in town for work if I can catch it available. Thanks again!
12405,326,"Bobby's place was perfect! The room was clean and spacious, as was the bathroom. Key to the bedroom was provided for my privacy. Would definitely stay again. Having the microwave and mini-fridge in the room was a nice touch."
12406,326,"Lovely house, great location and great amenities. Quiet and private. Host is very accommodating and responsive."
12407,326,"Awesome location, home, and host. This was the perfect place for me since I’m a night shift worker. The neighborhood is quiet, safe, nice, and clean. Bobby’s wife Alima is sweet and she’s a great cook! Most definitely gonna stay again!!!!"
12408,326,"This is a cool place if you just want to chill out and not be bothered. The rooms have large TV's you can hook anything up to, a nice bed, microwave and mini fridge. Bathroom is solid, laundry can be done, you can even cook if you want."
12409,326,Very nice room!

12411,326,Very homey everything was convenient Bobby’s place is a great place
12412,326,Never met the host but a very efficient check in process. Beautiful house with great amenities. I’d recommend for any busy professional traveling through NC
12413,326,"The only problem I had was that the bed felt uneven, so you constantly felt like you were going to rollout of it. Other than that everything else was as expected. Never met the host, but communication with him before hand and at arrival was good. Would definitely recommend this host."
12414,326,"Great
Really clean and comfy"

12422,326,"Very clean room, very nice house."
12423,326,"Second time using this Airbnb. Once again, comfortable space, easy check in, nice touches like in-room mini fridge and microwave.

Good place to stay in the Fayetteville area!"
12424,326,"Bobby gave exact directions, was responsive, and had set up a comfortable, clean room and bathroom that was well worth the price. I'd stay there again."
12425,326,"The space was nice, especially for the price. Checking in was super easy and convenient."
12426,326,"Bobby and his lovely bride were awesome hosts. They were very responsive to my texts, answered all my questions very promptly. Their home is warm, clean, quiet, and very welcoming. I felt very much at home. They provided everything I needed, including the right amount of privacy and friendliness. I strongly recommend them as hosts--they are not just super hosts, they are superstars!"
12427,326,Great place Thanks

12431,326,"Bobby was great! I pretty much just slept and showered there, then I would be out with friends. They were super respectful of my privacy. Bathroom is right outside the bedroom door. Own key to your room, keypad to get in the house. Great experience!"
12432,326,I loved it here with Bobby and his wife. I will definitely stay here again
12433,326,My stay was nice.
12434,326,Really clean. Respect your privacy but also there if you need them. Love the key code. Peaceful neighborhood. Great place to stay for work. Strong WIFi
12435,326,Great value and perfect for a quick work trip.
12436,326,","
12437,328,Great host.
12438,328,Great host
12439,328,"A house that’s close to food, a pharmacy and the highway, pretty quiet too"
12440,328,"The hosts of this property were very kind, and accommodated my schedule changes easily! It was fairly priced and I would certainly stay again. The bathroom was not very clean (trash un-emptied, not swept, etc) and it was a shared space which I was not expecting. Overall though the host was very communicative and the house was in a nice neighborhood."
12441,328,Wonderful stay! Thanks again!
12442,328,"What a great find! Love, love, love the private “living room” included in the bedroom space. Super friendly and really felt like home away from home all week!"
12443,328,"I wouldn't recommend to someone who is looking for a pleasant stay.. Squeaky bed, fan wasn't working, pets are too loud and smells a bit, parking restrictions.."
12444,328,"This was a quick overnight trip, close to everything I came in town for. It was a great midway point between Raleigh and Durham . Easy to find , clear instructions, nice host."
12445,328,"Tim is extraordinary, he made me feel right at home and tended to everything you’d expect of a host and much more. He’s extremely resourceful and willing to go above and far beyond to make your stay the best it can be."
12446,328,"Super convenient location in the heart of residential Cary. Quiet area, easy access to everything. The add'l cozy TV lounge area with couch and small frig and Keurig was a welcome bonus to relax."
12447,328,Bed was super comfortable and the secret hideaway TV room on point! That alone made the entire stay worthwhile! I will definitely be back again
12448,328,"Thanks Tim - your place is how you described it . Your instructions were clear and your place is close to good restaurants/shopping in Cary, NC."
12449,328,Thanks for hosting
12450,328,"Tim was great letting me book the stay last minute late at night! The house was very nice and the bed was comfortable! If I ever need a room near Raleigh again , I'll definitely look into stay at Tim's!"
12451,328,"Great stay for the price. Only issue was mini fridge was gross. Little clutter downstairs, but the room was clean and bed was super comfy. Tim was nice. Shower water never got hot, so I was freezing. You get what you pay for. Would stay there again."
12452,328,Great area and Tim was super nice and accommodating! Nice place to stay with a separate room to relax in attached to the bedroom.
12453,328,great host
12454,328,"Tim has a great room for you, the extra TV area was very cool, and I’m not a television watcher. Bed was very comfy."
12455,328,"Great stay… wonderful and very responsive hosts -to all my questions and needs… communications was excellent!.. And Tim was so pleasant to talk to….
Great price and value- property is close to everything!.. I would highly recommend this listing and would definitely return should my job require me to return to this area…"
12456,328,"The value cannot be beaten, for sure, and the neighborhood is cute with easy parking. The space is shared and that is sincerely meant. Just be aware of that when staying."
12457,328,Tim and the others were very accommodating. I’ve enjoyed my stay. Nice quiet place
12458,328,This is my favorite place to stay while I'm working in Raleigh!
12459,328,Tim was a great host. I booked this very last minute and he was accomodating with me checking in later than usual and also giving me an extra hour before check out on request!
12460,328,thank you.
12461,328,I'll be back!!
12462,328,Great stay
12463,328,"Tim is a very nice person, always wanting to help! The room was very good but the floor a little bit dirty. However, the house need a lot of improvement in terms of cleaning, specially de kitchen and bathroom, to much ants and other bugs that it is not very comfortable to cook either to eat without getting ants over your food or plate, the bathroom was also with hairs and not as clean as expected but decent. It's a good place and Tim is a nice guy as well as the other residents, just needs to improve in the cleaning overall."
12464,328,Awesome Stay!!
12465,328,Great stay and I wish that I could've stayed longer!!
12466,328,Thanks for the heads up on the cancellation. Looking forward to staying there in Future.
12467,328,"The house is located in a nice neighborhood but is a complete bachelor pad. Parking was difficult as 5 other cars were present ( 3 hosts parked in drive way and 2 guests on the street + me). The check in instructions were lengthy and not useful in explaining how to check in. The host wasn’t responsive to my concerns and stated he was busy with other endeavors . Dogs barked at the drop of a feather, the television didn’t work, and the “ complimentary coffee” was a keurig with no coffee, water or coffee pods. The host was unprepared ( no toilet paper or hand soap) in the shared restroom. Overall, there is a lot of room for improvement. I wouldn’t stay there again but I am glad other guests had a positive experience."
12468,328,Very friendly
12469,328,Every thing was great checking in. Liked having the extra room to watch tv and lounge out. And the bed was nice and comfortable
12470,328,Nice place to stay!
12471,328,🤙🏽
12472,328,Great stay. I extended my stay twice and they were accepted both times. Very flexible.
12473,328,"I enjoyed the space! The bed was comfy, and the couch and tv in the room was a nice touch. The location was good and a short walk to a bus stop. Right off the highway too so Uber rides were short."
12474,328,"Between COVID and winter weather delaying our trip to NC three different times, Tim was very understanding and accommodating during the whole thing. He worked with me and Airbnb support in being OK with constantly changing the dates we’d be staying, and it just made the process so much smoother. Our room was great with plenty of privacy, and Tim was great at communicating before and during our stay. Check-in/check-out and other details for our stay were clear and very detailed, which we appreciated. For the price, the convenient location and the accommodations, I’d love to stay again!"
12475,328,"Great stay, great people."
12476,328,This was a good place. I enjoyed my stay and I loved the board where people could put their names on.
12477,328,"For a quick stay room has everything and is spacious, also very clean. Downstairs tho is dirty and messy, dogs would bark at you all the time 7/10"
12478,328,"Tim is a nice person, and his apartment isn't too bad either. I gave my experience with him 4 stars only because there were a few minor hiccups related to things like cleaningness and parking. Other than that, everything else was pretty decent."
12479,328,"I've stayed at Tim's twice now, and hope to again next year.
He's a very friendly host, will help you out with his wide local knowledge.
The accommodation is not luxurious, but very good value for money, comfortable, warm and welcoming.
Tim is equally happy to sit and chat with you, or leave you to do your own thing, it's a totally relaxed atmosphere.
Looking forward to staying here again next year."
12480,328,"Tim is a friendly guy. Location is very central, close to supermarkets (Trader Joe's, Aldi, etc). 15-20 mins to Raleigh. The room could be cleaner, but for the price I can't really complain much. It's a good deal if you just need a place to sleep."
12481,328,Very nice location if you’re looking for a quiet place to rest. The host is very nice and helpful. Detailed check in process made things easy.
12482,328,Perfect local regarding travel close to a highway
12483,328,"Tim and Mars were very welcoming hosts (their other housemate was away) and more than willing to assist with anything asked or needed. Their home is ample, as is the guest space, and the atmosphere very relaxed. With a private en suite sitting/media room, this was an ideal space, conveniently located for a family event, in which to do some work in my spare ""down time."" Thanks guys, for a great stay!"
12484,328,Best to confirm me in few mins for stay
12485,328,Very friendly people. They respect privacy and the location was perfect! Great communication and A VERY COMFORTABLE BED 🤣💕 Definitely will return & stay again
12486,328,Enjoyed my stay. House is located in a beautiful quiet neighborhood. The private room in the back was a great touch. The dogs will bark but are friendly. Everything was laid out & detailed in the house manual so there weren’t any concerns.
12487,328,Nice safe neighborhood! Tim is a wonderful host!
12488,328,"Tim's home was welcoming and peaceful in a quiet wooded neighborhood in Cary. The room was clean and spacious with a very large and comfortable bed. It even came with an extra side room with a sofa, TV, and mini fridge. I'd definitely recommend staying there and look forward to staying again when I'm in the area."
12489,328,Tim has a wonderful home and there is no issues with the stay.. have stayed several times before and always had a nice stay..
12490,328,Great place enjoyed my stay ..
12491,328,Tim was very responsive. Mars was welcoming when I first checked in. I stayed a week for a new job I just started. I enjoyed the TV room that's attached. and the small fridge. it was just what I needed. perfect location near multiple eateries. also quiet and friendly neighborhood.
12492,328,"great room
nice amenities
nice ppl"
12493,328,It was very clean and quiet !
12494,328,"I found Tim's home just as described... I had a pleasant stay in a very quiet, lovely neighborhood. The location is not far from lots of restaurants, banks, etc. He and the roommate was very accommodating. When I return to the area I will certainly seek them out again."
12495,328,Nice cozy room with private adjacent sitting area with love seat ..mini fridge and full size tv...Tim and CoHost have 3 beautiful little dogs that are well trained and friendly...Nice Stay
12496,328,"Nice place, nice experience, nice people."
12497,328,Great value!
12498,328,"Wonderful place, very social housemates. Would highly recommend"
12499,328,Great host
12500,328,good place to stay at good location
12501,328,thanks
12502,328,"You get what you pay for here. This place wasn't comfortable, cobwebs on in the room near the window. rushed cleaning. Hard to reach host if you need anything. There's a dog that is hidden in the living room that barks at you when you enter, go to your room, and leave your room. Made me regret getting the airbnb immediately."
12503,328,"Such a great space! Tim was flexible and worked with me when I had to reschedule with work and family stuff. If you're hesitant because of some if the cleanliness reviews, I didn't have any issues. The house doesn't have brand new everything, but you can tell it's all been vacuumed and cleaned prior to my arrival. If you do encounter any issues, just notify Tim he's very helpful in making sure it's taken care of."
12504,328,Nice Spot Co-host was very nice and property was in good condition I’m in town a lot and look forward to future stays
12505,328,Easy check-in and good location for fellow single travelers. Tim was accommodating with me staying a few days longer. The dogs can be overly excited sometimes in the morning but other than that I had a great stay.
12506,328,"Spacious room
Great Cohosts on premises
Comfortable bed
Quiet area"
12507,328,"Felt like I was home, would recommend to anyone!!"
12508,328,This place is an absolute steal for the value. Tim and his co-hosts were wonderful. The place was clean and located in a beautiful area. I really enjoyed my stay.
12509,328,Everything was awesome
12510,328,2nd stay. Great value. Peaceful.
12511,328,Tim was very responsive and helpful. Unfortunately our plans changed and we had to cancel at the last minute. He was very understanding. I will definitely used Tim again.
12512,328,Good place to stay for a short work weekend.
12513,328,Great location
12514,328,Nice place to stay and very quiet love it.
12515,328,A perfect stay for a weary traveller.
12516,328,This was my 2nd time staying here. It feels like home. Very quiet and peaceful; very safe neighborhood. I would recommend this spot for any traveller. Two thumbs up 👍👍
12517,328,Very welcoming host that provided me a comfortable and safe home to stay in while I was moving and in transition.
12518,328,"nice host, easy to access, cozy room"
12519,328,"Clean, quiet, cute and quiet dogs. The tv lounge is really neat."
12520,328,"Truthful and transparent add, plenty of thoughtful touches to ensure guest comfort. I'll definitely be returning"
12521,328,"Serene location, spacious room."
12522,328,Nice quiet and cozy room
12523,328,A super nice room and sitting area with TV and loveseat. Really enjoyed.
12524,328,Good location and value for money.
12525,328,Excellent place. You can’t beat the price. Convenient and close to everything. Host is very responsive.
12526,328,Great place to stay for a great price! The puppies are adorable! Must pet!
12527,328,This was a great and comfy stay!
12528,328,Tim was responsive with communication and the room was excellent
12529,328,Great place and awesome experience.
12530,328,Everything was very nice including location cleaning.
12531,328,Great place very hospitable very clean very quiet
12532,328,Good place and cheap
12533,328,"Host that cares and understands. Thank you, Tim!"
12534,328,The room did not have a lock on the door.i had to install one
12535,328,"Very clean, very spacious, very peaceful.
Would recommend for anyone looking for good airbnb"
12536,328,"Great space to crash for a few weeks while I was working in Raleigh. Only minutes from shops and the highway, things were easily accessible. Highly recommend if you need an inexpensive place for a few nights."
12537,328,"NO LOCKS at all on the guest bedroom door. You CAN'T secure the bedroom, neither from the inside or outside. Tim said he'll installed them but didn't. Hopefully he did after I left. Please make sure to ask him if he did if you can contact him before booking. BUT it's a quiet place with cute puppies. Great location from the airport. Nice private mini living room next to bedroom. Nice neighborhood."
12538,328,"How was filthy inside and out. Walkways to home was covered with sticks and leaves and invisible. The entire house was filthy, did not stay one night. I was surprised that host took my money and allowed the house to be seen in this condition to ruin his listing. This was the utmost disrespectful, I’ve ever seen. Kitchen counters had junk, stains and food on them, same as the sink, refrigerator and floor. All common areas were junky and bathroom had stains in toilet, trash was full of trash, no promised amenities and dirty towels everywhere."
12539,328,Great host and great place to stay!
12540,328,I am very happy I found this listing. It was perfect for my stay and the host was extremely flexible with me altering my reservation to add others. It was extremely comfortable and felt at home. I was able to utilize the kitchen and cook my own vegan food. I will definitely stay again.
12541,328,"Tim is a great host and the home is located in a beautiful area. It's a great value, and a very comfortable bedroom/sitting room area."
12542,331,"My wife and I traveled to the Pittsboro NC area to attend a friend's memorial gathering and were excited to find such an extraordinary place to stay. We love to camp and we love the woods, so being off the grid was not a problem for us. On a freezing cold morning we were cozy and warm, thanks to the wood stove. And Julie is a generous host, providing fresh eggs that we cooked for breakfast. We really did enjoy our two night stay in this rustic, retrofitted bus in beautiful rural NC."
12543,331,"My husband and I love taking day trips up to Pittsboro and when we saw we could stay nearby for New Years eve, we jumped on it! Julie was easy to reach if we need anything and very friendly! The bus was cozy and very clean with a lot more space than we expected. The kitchen is set up with everything you need to prepare a quick meal and the bed was comfy with plenty of blankets if needed. We loved staying here and will keep this in our backpocket for our next overnight trip!"
12544,331,Julie and Steve went above and beyond to make sure that my dog and I enjoyed our stay.
12545,331,Julie is a great host who made us feel very comfortable and was super accommodating!
12546,331,Such a fun and unique stay! Super clean and comfortable!
12547,331,"We had a lovely stay in the bus, it was very cozy and warm with the wood stove! The fresh eggs/breakfast items and the friendly cat were an added bonus!"
12548,331,"This place was amazing! Julie was super responsive and made my boyfriend and I feel so welcome during our stay. Truly a five star experience for a two star price. Julie was kind enough to welcome us when we arrived after dark, gave us a quick tour and showed us how to use the woodburning stove. She already had the fire going and the bus all warmed up for us, which felt amazing coming in from the cold November night. The place felt so homey, and was even more spacious than it looked in the photos! I've been on converted school bus campers before, and this Greyhound bus was far bigger. We cooked a full meal using the camp stove and kitchenware provided, and made hot chocolate in a saucepan on top of the woodburning stove. We were also delighted by the fresh eggs and breakfast treats she gifted us the first morning of our stay! It was awesome to enjoy fresh, flavorful eggs and literally look out the window at the chickens who produced them. We hope to come back soon! Thank you Julie! :)"
12549,331,"Julie’s bus was the perfect getaway! She has thoughtfully stocked it with everything you need for a comfortable and cozy stay. She hand delivered eggs, bread, butter, jam and milk for us to make a yummy breakfast. The camping stove provided is clean and easy to use. The bed was cozy and had tons of pillows. The outdoor shower was stocked well and was a relaxing and great way to end a long day. The outhouse was clean and easy to use."
12550,331,"Thanks, Roni! So sorry I forgot to leave you a review! You guys were great and welcome back any time."
12551,331,"This place was so great. The outdoor shower was perfect, I loved keeping the stove warm, and the rooster in the morning was all exactly what I needed. I also cooked a full meal on the bus and loved the quiet mornings. 10/10 recommend and have sent to several friends!"
12552,331,"Julie's bus is very cosy and more spacious than you'd think. It's perfect for a couple and is a great getaway from the day to day without going to far. It's nice to feel tied into nature with the outhouse, the wood fire and freshly layed eggs. It is also is secluded enough to see a beautiful dark starry sky. The bus is clean and has the amenities one needs to cook and unwind. Very much recommend it especially if your interested in alternative modes of living."
12553,331,Very nice cozy place! Friendly host! Awesome atmosphere!
12554,331,Would definitely stay again. Even more charming in person. Highly enjoyed it!
12555,331,"This was exactly how it was listed. Pretty place in the woods, close by to my weekend activities! Enjoyed the fresh eggs in the AM!"
12556,331,"Had a great stay! Absolutely loved the camping feel. The outdoor shower was awesome. the bus had a great cozy feel to it. You can tell they put a lot of time into making it a one of a kind stay. would definitely stay again.
P.s. Phone signal was a bit rough out there but the wifi from Julie's house helped us get some work done and gave us enough reception to get our maps back up to get back home all good."
12557,331,The place is magical! Bring earplugs if you want to sleep in cause the rooster is a very enthusiastic host.
12558,331,"This was more than glamping experience for me and just so peaceful!! This place exceeded my expectations greatly and the pictures are exact. I give it an extra plus for having wifi, a shower, electricity, and an outhouse as part of the camping experience! Julie is so sweet and provided a phenomenal breakfast! I loved seeing the chickens and a adorable cat that is super affectionate. Inside the bus, you are provided more than you need (salt, pepper, cooking oil, pots and pans, plates, silverware, sponges, dish soap, fresh drinking water, French press, pens, highlighters, matches, paper towels, flashlights, books, games, sewing kit, candle, etc). The fan, which you are able to charge and unplugged (so you can bring it around the bus with you) kept me cool the entire time. I charged it during the day and it lasted the entire night while I was sleeping. Overall 10/10 for the price it is. ❤️"
12559,331,Exactly as advertised. Great place and great people as hosts. Was very nice getting eggs and toast easy morning to make in the bus. Can't say enough how much I enjoyed my stay.
12560,331,"There are not enough words to describe the kindness of the hosts that live next-door to the bus. You are welcomed with a smile and a tour of everyone inside and outside the bus! The outhouse is clean and shower is refreshing and very warm!! This gem in the woods is the best of both worlds……. in all honesty my 9 year old called it glamping!! The Wi-Fi works great outside and at the head of the comfortable full-size bed. All you need is at your fingertips and an open mind! There’s a great little one burner and a tea kettle that was great for little meal and an area for food prep and a cooler full of your stuff that needs to stay cold. If my 9 years who has never camped in any form or fashion can go #1 in the woods and go #2 in an outhouse that is cleaner than some peoples personal bathrooms, have no worries. The fresh eggs, delicious apple butter and grain bread that you are greeted with in the mornings start the day off right!! The bus and the grounds are beautiful, well maintained and close to great swimming areas and small businesses with local products and foods! We will be back!!!!!!"
12561,331,Arrived to a beautiful little plot of land and took and amazing outdoor shower. Woke up to fresh eggs and some other fixins. Couldnt be more pleased!
12562,331,"The bus is super cool, and you can tell they put a lot of love into it. An amazing stay if you are a more rugged camper. I was definitely put off by the fact that you can only use the outhouse for #2. I get it’s a compostable toilet but then there should be a private set up for you to just go #1. Instead it’s a flashlight and a roll of toilet paper. Given that you’re literally in their back yard this was not really okay with me as I feel a bit vulnerable as a women just popping a squat on someone else’s property. It was also not air conditioned which is 100 percent noted and she was kind enough to tell me before we arrived, but we ended up deciding to stay with a friend close by since we were traveling with our dogs and felt they would be too uncomfortable. Communication was great, bus is cute, it just might not be for everyone so definitely read all house rules before booking."
12563,331,"That you clearly state the issue was your own for not reading the house rules or digesting the information that was given to you, both through the listing and by direct communication, you still register a pubic complaint that could cost my super host status. That is very hard to take, Madison, particularly when I went out on a limb to approve a stay with three dogs."
12564,331,Great spot! Enjoy the coziness of a bus that is in a convenient location.
12565,331,A great little adventure when you want to slow life down a bit.
12566,331,"Julie was a great host and her bus was very comfy and absolutely adorable! Comfortable bed, warm wood stove, fresh well water, a little bit of electricity (but keep it to a minimum since it's off-grid), chickens clucking, roosters crowing, some fresh eggs, super cute cat ""Georgie the Slim"" to befriend. Off-grid living out of the '53 bus was so lovely. Even sitting in the cutely designed composting toilet felt very grounding and natural. I hope to come back for a potentially longer stay sometime!"
12567,331,"The bus was so fun! There was some lack of communication on both parts. Not sure if I would stay again, but not a bad experience."
12568,331,"beautiful little spot, especially when I got to use the wood stove. close to Pittsboro. if you're tall watch your head!"
12569,331,10/10 recommended for a unique stay!
12570,331,"Cozy, eclectic and impeccably clean…Julie’s restored bus was a perfect weekend getaway! I enjoyed the wood burning stove indoors, the dreamy bed and the dark starry skies at night. Julie was quick to lend a hand and easy to get ahold of. She has created a comfortable and charming retreat in the woods that makes you feel welcome. It is simple, peaceful, and perfect for a rest off-grid! I cannot wait to return."
12571,331,"Julie met me upon check-in, showed me around, and then enabled me to totally do my own thing. The bus was super cool, everything was clean and accessible, and the whole stay was peaceful and comfortable. Such a sweet little place!"
12572,331,"We had an amazing time in Julie’s bus! It was very relaxing, clean, and cozy. Julie went above and beyond, she brought us fresh eggs and breakfast items our first morning. The outhouse was clean and we loved using the outdoor shower. The wood stove was so nice in the evenings and at night when it got cold. We loved watching the chickens and their cat is so sweet. It was the perfect weekend getaway!"
12573,331,"I thought this was a really cool and unique place to stay. The bus was super cozy, and clearly built and decorated with love. If you're looking for a quiet and clean place to stay and don't mind going without some modern luxuries, I would definitely recommend coming here."
12574,331,"I was so excited to find this place on my travel route. It was off the grid, however up my alley on the side of amazingly cool!...and she gave us breakfast food-fresh eggs from her chickens and yummy homemade blueberry jam! I cooked up a feast with the lil propane stove. A place I would highly recommend and do again! ‘Twas so very cozy quaint & comfy! Just keep those logs burning!"
12575,331,"Really nice and clean! It was so cool to see the bus transformed into a living space. I stayed on a really cold winter night, but I think staying in the summertime would be even better. Great value and great experience!"
12576,331,"Beautiful location, love the bus, very peaceful and relaxing. I wish that I would of had more time there. And I hope that I get a chance to stay here again."
12577,331,"10/10 this was the most lovely stay and such at reasonable price. Julie was so helpful. She provided us with a yummy breakfast with eggs from her chickens and all the fixings for delicious coffee. The bus is so cozy and well kept, and the outdoor shower is so peaceful."
12578,331,"A quirky, comfy place.
Well designed : even prettier than the photos. Easy to cook simple meals , comfy bed, delightful fresh eggs from Juie’s chickens.
My visit was a cold night: though the wood stove did a great job, I was glad I brought a sleeping bag so I could mostly ignore stoking it overnight…I hope to come again and stay longer to appreciate the outdoor dining area, shower and general friendly homesteading vibe. Thanks, Julie!"
12579,331,Such a great experience! The bus sits in the charming backwoods of north Carolina and is rustic and beautiful. Julie was super responsive and made sure we were taken care of. The bed is very comfortable and their are games to keep you busy before hand. Even the outhouse was cute! We were greeted by an extremely friendly cat and Julie brought us fresh eggs for breakfast from the chickens on property. Such a special place!
12580,331,"Julie’s bus is super cozy and adorable! It’s perfect for people who enjoy simple, sustainable life (: I wouldn’t recommend it to those who are bothered by using an outhouse, having to work a bit for hot water and a warm space, or want more room. The rooster (who sounds a bit like a hoarse old man, haha!) woke me up around 8:00 which was great because I was expecting 5:30! (: I would recommend bringing a book, soap if you want to shower (shampoo is provided) and warm socks or slippers because the floor stays cold! Beautiful, lovely place, with amazing starry skies at night and the sweetest cat I’ve ever met!!"
12581,331,Great place to stay while attending the Woodwright's School. Thoroughly enjoyed the wood stove and the comfortable bed. Shower is plenty hot and Julie was very accommodating about when I wanted to take a shower. Would absolutely stay again if in Pittsboro area.
12582,331,"Exactly what the listing offers, a bit like a camping experience but it feels cozier and safer. As long as you've read the listing it should be just as great as you expect, host is very friendly and helpful."
12583,331,I loved my stay here. Everything was as described and lovely. Julie was a great host and a great communicator. I would stay here again.
12584,331,Great experience - very clean and had everything we needed for a get away weekend. Only issue was with the wifi which was spotty at best. Would definitely stay again but would plan to be totally off all devices. George the cat added to the fun and the chickens were great entertainment.
12585,331,"We had a great time staying in this airbnb - and highly recommend it! It was such a unique experience and exactly as described. Some highlights: charm of the bus itself, delicious fresh eggs from the chickens, very nice hot outdoor shower, comfy bed, battery powered lights to use at night, and hospitality of the host."
12586,331,"We had a great stay at this very unique airbnb! We are not camping types, yet this was still comfortable. We would stay here again. Julie is extra awesome, because she mailed me my laptop after I left it behind!"
12587,331,We thoroughly enjoyed our visit on the bus. Super cute and comfortable. We attended a music festival and this was the perfect spot to start and end our days. We had everything we needed and Julie's instructions were perfect. One night we had a thunderstorm and listening to the rain on the roof of the bus was fabulous. Would definitely return. Thank you!
12588,331,"We loved our visit to the bus! Lovely host, beautiful space, terrific upscale camping experience for me and my kiddo!"
12589,331,Rustic camping experience but with just enough convenience to be perfect!
12590,331,Julie’s bus is super hygge and exactly what glam ping should be. She has everything you want for a few nights in the woods and her outdoor cat is a bonus.
12591,331,it's really nice! just can't urinate in the bathroom though.
12592,331,"An oasis you can’t miss! The bus is decorated beautifully and includes a working sink! The surroundings are incomparable, endlessly green and stunning in their lushness. And, the morning after I checked in, I woke up to fresh eggs from the chickens on the property. The outdoor shower has better hot water than my own apartment. I will definitely be staying here again"
12593,331,"Wonderful and peaceful place for a weekend trip, particularly for off-grid relax and recharge. The vintage bus is well organized and decorated as lovely. Highly recommended!"
12594,331,"Julie's place was lovely, very peaceful and clean. The outdoor shower has better hot water than some apartments. The woods, chickens and cat all added to the stay. It does get hot, but it is NC. So braving the summer heat is to be expected. We couldn't have asked for a better stay."
12595,331,"This is a great place for a weekend trip. The hosts are fantastic- my husband wanted to know more about their solar electric system and they were happy to show him. The outdoor shower is better than a lot of hotel showers I've used. The only thing not ideal is the outhouse/restroom situation, but it was as expected. It is close to the Haw river if you like to kayak or canoe. I would recommend this place to anyone!"
12596,331,Extremely wonderful person. She is extremely accommodating and is very easy to talk to :)
12597,331,Such a sweet experience. Everything was so intentional and lovely. We felt very welcome and thoroughly enjoyed staying here. Cannot wait to return.
12598,331,"We absolutely LOVED Julie's place. The bus was very nicely set up and the surrounding land was beautiful. The chickens provided some great entertainment, especially one little escape artist. Julie was a friendly and accommodating host. We had fresh breakfast items provided both mornings and she thoroughly explained everything. We absolutely can't wait to come back."
12599,331,We just loved the bus! Getting ready for our wedding afternoon felt so special there. Thanks Julie!
12600,331,Awesome place
12601,331,"Julie was an incredible host, the RV was absolutely adorable, and I had fresh eggs from the chickens in the morning for breakfast. If you’re looking for a few days off grid, this is absolutely the place to go!"
12602,331,This bus is super cool. Very cozy and quiet. Julie lit the fireplace for my first chilly night on the bus and was very helpful throughout my stay. Absolutely recommend.
12603,331,"Such a lovely spot! The bus is an incredible and inspiring setup, and the breakfast was simply beautiful. Highly recommend!"
12604,331,"This is, by far, the cutest and neatest place I’ve ever stayed on Airbnb. Julie’s place is filled with quirky little decorations (like the collaged walls and metal art outside!) And thoughtful additions to make your stay easy and cozy. My cat Stormy loved to sit at the window and watch the chickens and songbirds, and the eggs Julie left for us in the morning were so tasty. :)

We booked this stay as a belated Valentine’s trip, and it was romantic and cozy and perfect."
12605,331,Very clean and a fun camping experience!
12606,331,"What an awesome stay! The pictures do not do it justice in terms of showing all the homey touches in & outside of the bus. Julie was a very friendly host to us, providing a nice breakfast to cook in the morning. Definitely recommend for a little getaway!"
12607,331,Loved this bus! Julie is a great host and the breakfast just makes it that much better! Would definitely recommend it!
12608,331,Lovely converted bus in the woods. Very charming!
12609,331,Amazing experience!
12610,331,Such a cool spot. The bus is way bigger than you'd think. Wood stove keeps it nice and cozy. The property is serene and beautiful and the chickens are a highlight. Definitely a great unique stay for anyone looking to unplug out in the country.
12611,331,"If you want a cool, different, eclectic experience, this is the spot for you! Loved the outdoor shower!"
12612,331,The bus was way bigger than expected! Very cozy and delightful. The outdoor shower was beautiful & the fresh breakfast was such a thoughtful touch. Just a short drive to town too.
12613,331,Very sweet spot!
12614,331,"Hey -well I just saw that it was coffee from the message on the review. I couldn't see your review until I left one of my own. So, sorry it was so harsh, again, would have been good to have communicated that before. I am thankful it is not body fluid, and will use stain remover and not bill you for anything."
12615,331,"Great, cozy, safe place you stay. Julie very available for questions and concern s. Late at night, kit up the generator so my husband's CPAP would stay on all night."
12616,331,We had a wonderful time staying in the bus! It was much larger than I expected and the breakfast in the morning was a highlight! Unique and fun experience!
12617,331,A charming off grid experience. Worth every penny
12618,331,"This is a great airbnb for those who want to disconnect from the world. Being on a road trip, we stopped by on a rainy day with our newborn and it was still a great experience. In the morning, the host provided (eggs, bread, butter, jam... for) breakfast."
12619,331,"Staying at the bus was such a fun experience! Julie was a great communicator and made sure we knew ahead of time just what we were getting into with the solar power and lack of AC in the bus. The woods were peaceful and relaxing, and you should take this opportunity!"
12620,331,"This is a lovely place to stay! Pretty deep in the woods/country, it’s a nice relaxing evening in a cool, converted space. There are chickens next to the bus, so prepare for a early wake up."
12621,331,Amazing and very peaceful stay! Great hospitality and stress free location.
12622,343,"Great stay, comfy bed. Fun dog if you like dogs. Super great value if you need a place to layover."
12623,343,Great communication from Gwendolyn. Awesome place to stay.
12624,343,One of the homiest Airbnbs I’ve ever witnessed. I loved every moment of it. It’s like visiting family staying there. Maui and Simba are just so lovable. Gwen and Santiago are such great host. They are very inviting and make you feel safe. I would recommend the president to stay there if he needed a safe place to be. I will be booking again‼️
12625,343,"My stay was absolutely lovely, the hosts were nothing short of amazing. It was a place that will forever stick with me in a very trying time. The dog and cat gave me so much love and really gave me a home away from home. I would highly recommend this exceptional home for anyone looking to escape from a day at work or traveling for business. There are many restaurants within walking distance and many many more only a stone's throw away.

Thank you for a lovely stay."
12626,343,"Great stop on our road trip, definitely worth the stop"
12627,343,Loved it! Highly recommended for anyone staying overnight for business in Gastonia or Charlotte.
12628,343,I recommend reading all the descriptions very well.
12629,343,Great place. Definitely worth it. Simba was also adorable
12630,343,"Loved it, highly recommend to anyone visiting Gastonia!"
12631,343,Gwen and Santiago were great hosts with outstanding personalities. Their home was also well kept and Simba and Maui were just as welcoming. 5/5 stars from me and I hope we meet again ^-^
12632,343,"Gwen seems very nice and she was very communicative and welcoming. It was a nice stay, especially as a go-between for Charlotte and crowders. would recommend."
12633,343,Great place with everything you could need.
12634,343,Great hosts!
12635,343,"We absolutely loved our stay! My husband and I were a little hesitant about booking a room in someone’s house, but it far exceeded our expectations! The room was so cozy and we were provided everything we could need for a one night stay. It felt welcoming and very homey. We felt safe and the bed itself is so comfortable. The hosts were very responsive and made sure we had a great stay! We didn’t get to meet Simba, but we hope to meet him next time. Will definitely stay here again for any future visits in the area! :)"
12636,343,Gwendolyn was a great host! We enjoyed our stay!
12637,343,Absolutely loved staying here. Place was perfect.
12638,343,Perfect as always !
12639,343,"Lovely and accommodating - especially as a last minute & during the holidays check-in. Both spaces (bed & bath) were lovely! I thought the private bath was attached to the room itself but it's right next door in the hall. Also, if visiting in the winter and you're warm-natured, get cozy pjs and socks cause it got a bit nippy in the morning ;-) Thanks for having me!"
12640,343,"The room was very clean and exactly what we expected. It worked perfectly for us. We did have some difficulty with the app to unlock the door, but that was probably user error. Gwendolyn was very understanding and left me a key."
12641,343,The house was just like the pictures and Gwen was very welcoming. The street was busy so be careful getting out of the car!
12642,343,Great stay! And cute pets!
12643,343,Nothing but good things to say about this place. Gwendolyn is very kind and responsive and made it super easy for us. (She’s got a photography business too!) We got greeted at the door by a cute cat even! Highly recommend this place to stay for a night or several nights.
12644,343,Gwendolyn was very accommodating for my last minute request. Room was comfortable and clean.
12645,343,"The home was beautiful, especially when decorated for Christmas. Gwendolyn and Santi made me and my wife feel right at home with their amazing hospitality. Simba was a very well behaved doggie who loved to play. We will definitely be staying here again if we are in the area!"
12646,343,Wonderful place to stay! Thank you.
12647,343,"Great short stay! Thank you for hosting us. It was clean, cozy and had a nice bathroom/shower. Perfect for a quick trip to the area."
12648,343,Cozy room with a funny German shepherd in the house:)
12649,343,Cozy stay in a lovely location.
12650,343,Thanks for a lovely stay! The room was very pleasant and the location perfect. We would happilly stay again.
12651,343,Great little spot in the middle of town. Very clean and comfortable and very much worth the value. Coming and going was easy for me as I work early mornings and late nights and usually it is a problem foe hosts but not here! Would stay again for sure.
12652,343,Thoughtful clean room and bathroom. Exceptionally friendly host. Would recommend to anyone.
12653,343,The location was great for my travels. Comfy bed and room. The spa shower was nice. Easy check in and out.
12654,343,"I’ve always been skeptical about booking a private room, and never have. Yet I gave it a shot and Gwen&Santis place was perfect. I work out of town and long hours; therefore, I never saw the host. The smart key was extremely convenient for me to get in at night. I loved the fact that there were a selection of books in the room. Having a hot water kettle in there also was amazing. There was hot tea, instant coffee, and oatmeal as well stocked up for my stay. Although, I did bring my own shampoo they did have some to use as well as provided a wash cloth incase you don’t have one. I felt like I was just coming home from work each night instead of being uncomfortable..which is always nice when it’s Longer days. Thank you!!!"
12655,343,Great place to stay. Nice people. Good communication. Highly recommended.
12656,343,Very comfortable environment I highly recommend
12657,343,"Such a warm and cozy home. Gwen was very helpful and very kind ; even added a welcoming homemade treat. The accommodating bedroom and bathroom couldn't be any better. And yes, that is some shower."
12658,343,"We had a great one night stay here. The bed was extremely comfortable, parking and check-in were easy, and the house was welcoming. I thoroughly enjoyed the pets and they were very well behaved (unless you count Maui always trying to come into my room, which isn't allowed :) but otherwise they were great). We wish we could have stayed longer. If we are ever back in the area, we will definitely stay here again. Thanks for a great stay."
12659,343,"Excellent location, quiet neighborhood, awesome bathroom and shower!"
12660,343,I loved staying here!! Gwen and her family are so kind and welcoming and her pets are adorable 🥰 too! So comfortable and relaxing 😌 thank you!
12661,343,Communication was great and would recommend staying here :)
12662,343,Loved it! The shower is so awesome.
12663,343,"PRICE IS OK. BE CAUTIOUS.

When I book I would check if all the rules apply to you because when you check in there will be additional rules previous of check in. Behind the “sign in book,” the additional rule book will be found. I found could be easily missed when you first check in. There is rules on the bed entering, plus the additional rule book above the fireplace behind the check in book.

If you like to use the kitchen or washer/dryer you have to stay more then 3 days. Be cautious of not using the plates that are right next to the microwave. The note says, “please do not use dishes in microwave - it causes warping and stains from food. Thanks. :).” However, You are welcome to use other plate in the kitchen but there is specific rules entering the kitchen and other uses of the kitchen area. A LOT of rules AFTER booking you could be unaware of. BE CAUTIOUS.

You can hear their sound machine that is upstairs on the stairs
all through the night in your room!!! Must be CUSTOM to a sound machine.

I also found downloading the app to enter the premises was on the inept side. We all have so many apps and to DOWNLOAD, sign UP, sign IN for temporary stay doesn’t seem necessary. Maybe longer stay for some??

As of damage of any material be extra cautious. Your stay is a vintage stay with plenty of vintage material. Prices are high and most “private room” Airbnb host don’t have high damage prices. This was my first AIRBNB to even have a list of damages.
With that being said. This should cause awareness that you could be questionable if you be the one paying for previous guest(s) damages if something breaks or a material be damaged on your time at this specific stay.

There is a small desk to eat but it’s super small. Similar to a small school desk when you are in elementary school. With that being said no more then two people would be even feasible at the table. Two is questionable.

Simba(dog)
Is not aggressive but your personal space is by far questionable with Simba.

As for the shower. It’s nice but it’s not the first advertised Aesthetic Airbnb that has been cheaper with over the top features! I have recently stayed with a extra large attic room, with a beautiful screened in porch with top of the line furniture that was early 1900s downtown home, a downtown home late 1800s, with aesthetic touches in EVERY detail of the home( $35 a night) our favorite STAY so far!!! Along with a colonial mansion for $45 A NIGHT with a pool! Each of these airbnbs provide a kitchen, washer/dryer with detergent, ect, along, with many more small details.


Take your time as you view the Charlotte area/suburbs!! There is a beautiful variety of private rooms in the area! ♌️♍️"
12664,343,"Erica,
I am sad to hear that our stay did not meet your expectations. Allow me to address your concerns for the benefit and clarification for future guests:
Our stay is priced with Airbnb's Smartpricing, which means Airbnb changes the nightly price based on demand. We have priced our stay competitively for our area and the amenities we offer, and based on the amount of repeat business we get and our high occupancy rate, we believe we are offering a a good value to Airbnb users.

The House Rules on our listing (which are accessible before booking) are the same as those in our *guidebook.* We provide a list of the prices to replace items that only applies in the case of an item being damaged or stolen by a guest. I got this idea from other Airbnbs I have stayed at and I think it's useful upfront information to put a guest at ease in case they accidentally cause damage. We carefully review the room after each stay while cleaning and address damages immediately to ensure no one has to pay for a damage they did not cause.

The *welcome sheet* on the bed gives information about your stay, amenities, and check-out. These guidelines and information help to maintain safety and privacy during your stay in a private room of our primary residence. For example, the matter about the plates is a heads up about what will happen if you put those plates in the microwave. I think most guests are able to distinguish between this kind of helpful information and actual house rules. We have solved this issue already by buying new plates so future guests will not have to worry about microwaving dishware.

Regarding our kitchen, as you have seen, it isn't quite big enough to comfortably share freely, which is why put some limitations on its use. We try to accommodate guests' needs regarding kitchen access, but it starts with guests communicating their needs. We allow guests to do laundry for free if they are staying for extended periods.

We do use a sound machine (rain sound) at night to mitigate extra noise for ourselves and for our guests. We would be glad to move the machine or turn it down upon request.

We have had good success with our smartlock, and on request, we have alternatives to using the app.

Finally, we make no apologies for Simba and Maui, who are both delightful members of our family, friendly and sociable, and genuinely enjoyed by most of our guests. We suggest that anyone who does not look forward to meeting them would be better accommodated elsewhere."
12665,343,"We had a great stay! The room was comfortable and beautiful, the hosts were kind and welcoming, the pets were sweet and the shower was AMAZING. We would recommend this as a place to stay."
12666,343,"Loved the place! It was cozy, clean, and affordable."
12667,343,"Amazing stay! Very nice and clean, adorable pets, and clear communication. Couldn't ask for a better experience!"
12668,343,Very cozy and accommodating! Loved getting to socialize with her pets! The shower was absolutely terrific! Makes me want to get one of my own!
12669,343,Gwendolyn was very friendly and accommodating. The room was super cute! We will definitely stay with her again if the chance arises.
12670,343,We loved everything about our stay at Gwen’s beautiful home. Great WiFi for those who may need to work / study.
12671,343,If I ever will need a stay in Gastonia I choose that place one more time !!)
12672,343,"This place is exactly as written. Very comfortable bed, nice shower, adorably friendly furry four-leggers, and a communicative and friendly host. I would happily stay here again."
12673,343,Gwendolyn was a wonderful host. Had a great time at the house. Will stay there again if I am around the area.
12674,343,"I would highly recommend anyone stay here! The house is beautiful and the check in process was smooth. Free street parking, comfortable bed, and the shower is incredible."
12675,343,Great place!
12676,343,"We had an absolute amazing stay. The owner is so sweet, bed is supper comfortable, and bathroom was out of a dream. Definitely would go back. Do check them out and stay with them."
12677,343,"Location was very close to anywhere you need to be. If you love cats and dogs, they have the most friendliest you could ever play or hang out with. It was also a prime hot weekend and the AC worked perfectly and when you take a shower there in the bathroom next to your room, it’s heaven."
12678,343,"Gwen's house was stylish, comfy and easy to find. It was convenient to all my destinations. The shower was as advertised. Gwen was very amicable though our communication was brief. I would stay again."
12679,343,"This stay is an incredible value and was absolutely amazing. Santi checked us in and was very accommodating. The home is beautiful, as is the room. It is very carefully designed and maintained, and has all the amenities one could need. The 2 real highlights of this place are the shower (seriously the best shower I’ve ever experienced or seen. I would pay just to come shower here!) and the pets, Maui and Simba. They are kept out of the room which is nice for those worried about pet hair. Simba was SO sweet and really brightened up our morning. We will definitely return if we’re in NC again!"
12680,343,Had a great experience! The hosts were super communicative and the pets were great!
12681,343,Perfect work a quick work trip. Very responsive and kind.
12682,343,"This room was just perfect. I was greeted by their family cat who was so sweet. Bed was comfortable, and the shower is awesome!"
12683,343,"Gwen and Santi were excellent hosts! The space was clean, comfortable, and private. I felt very safe. And their adorable pets Simba and Maui were an added fun bonus!"
12684,343,"From the historic charm to the best doggie ambassador, you will love this place. Gwen has prepared everything so well. I hated to leave."
12685,343,Thank you!
12686,343,I loved my stay here! They were so nice and everything was so clean. The shower had to be my favorite part of the house. I don't normally take one every day but I did during my stay! Food in the area is amazing so definitely go checkout what there is around the area.
12687,343,"Nice place, great hosts, and an amazing shower!"
12688,343,"Thank you, Gwen, a wonderful place to stop for the night. Did anyone mention how epic the shower is...?"
12689,343,Excellent service and space! Highly recommend!
12690,343,The description is spot-on. I have zero complaints. I slept well and the shower was awesome. Definitely my favorite part. Thank you!
12691,343,"This property was excellent, the setup is very accommodating and the host are there to help if you need. The cookies are an amazing addition as well, I could have eaten a dozen myself hahahaha. Overall A+ and I would stay again."
12692,343,Great place! Had a great stay
12693,343,This host was an incredible communicator and their place was so wonderful. It’s beautiful and clean and they even had little cookies as a welcome treat. A great stay! Highly recommend!
12694,343,Very helpful enjoyed my stay
12695,343,"This was my second stay with Gwendolyn (this time with my husband.) We enjoyed the historic little bungalow in the historic York Chester Historic District. We needed to travel up to Lincolnton a couple of times and it was very convenient to hit 321 North.

The little touches are very nice - cookies, candies, coffee, oatmeal. The shower in the bathroom is a treat. We loved meeting Simba!

We enjoyed eating at Viva Chicken (Peruvian) and Barrister's At The Esquire Hotel during our visit."
12696,343,"This is a great room and bath in a very cool house convenient to downtown Gastonia. Communication from Gwen was excellent, check in a breeze. The room was very cozy -- I felt at home during my short stay. As others have noted, the shower is incredible. Also....the wi-fi is VERY fast. Overall, a very good value."
12697,343,Very nice accommodations. Clean and inviting.
12698,343,This was a great place to while I was visiting a school. Maui was sweetest & chattiest kitty ever!Gwendolyn was a fantastic communicator & host.
12699,343,"Extremely beautiful home and hosts Gwen was really kind and helpful. The room had everything you could possibly need as well as the bathroom. Homemade cookies were delicious such a kind touch, we absolutely enjoyed our stay. Simba & maui reminded me of my pets back home 🤍"
12700,343,Gwendolyn is warm and welcoming and provides a super clean space. I would definitely stay again.
12701,343,Love it! I've stayed multiple times.
12702,343,Awesome place to stay and the description is spot on
12703,343,"Wonderful host, super comfy bed and totally awesome shower!!"
12704,343,"We highly recommend staying with Gwen and Santi. The hosts made us feel welcome, and the room was very comfortable. We enjoyed our stay!"
12705,343,"Great room, house and furniture all seemed clean and sturdy which is nice especially in historic neighborhoods. I will be going back!"
12706,343,Great little historic home if you are in need of a place to stay in Gastonia. The hosts are wonderful. I was a bit concerned about the neighboring homes but felt very safe once inside. Note: there is some traffic noise as it’s on a main road but Gwendolyn provides ear plugs. Bed is comfy and shower is amazing. Pets are friendly. Cute historic home mainly in original condition. Don’t forget to book a photo session with Gwendolyn! You won’t be disappointed.
12707,343,"I really loved my stay with Gwen, Santi, Simba, and sweet kitty! Everything was so clean and nice and they are the nicest couple! I hope to be back soon."
12708,343,Such a cozy little place! My husband and I were house hunting in Charlotte for a few days. The room was super cute with sweet little touches. I had to spend all day in the room one day because I was working and it worked out perfectly. Hosts were super accommodating. The shower was great! Would definitely stay again!
12709,343,Gwendolyn was kind and cheery and left me delicious home made cookies on my pillow :)
12710,343,Loved it! Highly recommend
12711,343,great place to stay the night especially if you are a dog lover! very comfortable stay and very friendly family!
12712,343,This place is a great overnight stay! Very easy to find and use key access. Everything we needed was provided in the room and bathroom. Between the decor and friendly pets we felt right at home! Hostess was very nice and gave us cookies to go. This place gets a 10/10 in my book!
12713,343,My friend and I had a great stay here!! Will definitely book again if I’m ever in the area again 😊
12714,343,"We really enjoyed our stay. Homey, comfortable. Great shower!"
12715,343,"AMAZING shower, very clean, and cute puppy!"
12716,343,"You will be blessed to have stayed at such a wonderful, friendly place. The room is comfortable and cozy. The atmosphere just hugs you with warmth. Gwen and Santi are so very kind and willing to do everything to make your stay a pleasant one. I was nervous at first as this was my first Airbnb experience. That went away as soon as I walked in the door. I highly recommend this booking!!"
12717,343,Third stay - loved it!
12718,343,"The place was nice, very clean and accommodated. The host didn’t bother us, and was able to get in and out of the house easily. Overall great stay!"
12719,343,"Great location, great amenities, great host!"
12720,343,"I had a lovely, and restful stay in this cozy spot. It was an easy first time airbnb experiencefor me, made enjoyableby the welcoming space and hospitality!"
12721,347,Great deal!
12722,347,A great palace
12723,347,"Wasn't clean enough to stay. The host was apologetic and asked for time to get it cleaned but I got my son and his mom with me, so we had to go. I may give another try at some point cus its good location and low price."
12724,347,Great stay!
12725,347,I was so disappointed. When it came time to check in I never got a code . Sat outside with my baby for hours to get a response hours later after air bnb had already refunded me . Never was able to even stay .
12726,347,Wonderful Host and Place to Stay
12727,347,"It's Kool to stay there. But it's freezing beds are right under neath next to windows. The bathroom is not in the same as the Airbnb, it's in the garage.
Which I never saw it. But, perhaps the other guests had to use it also due to some pipes busting in guest house.
The stay for one night is Kool, can use some more blankets and little more ideas. Reginald was good with communication, and messaged back in timely manner."
12728,347,Exactly as described real good guy always there when you need him love staying here easy to communicate with and will work with you if need to extend or anything great experience every time I stay here
12729,347,if you go there in winter time make sure you bring extra space heaters. there was a basketball hoop that was broken which seemed extremely dangerous still exposed bars.
12730,347,"This guest is pretty good. Even though it was a bit chilly, I was still able to make it through my stay."
12731,347,"No electricity on the front side, extremely cold"
12732,347,"The place was roomy, quiet, safe, and clean. Reginald was courteous, friendly, and helpful. I did not have any issues during my one night stay at his place."
12733,347,really nice quiet stay !! Lovely nice home everything clean an very big space an nice people I definitely recommend an would stay here again ..
12734,347,"Great stay, felt safe"
12735,347,Great spot. Nice and quiet.
12736,347,"I had a great time at this location . The communication was super easy and quick and the place looks exactly like it does on the pictures. The neighborhood is very conveniently located near Fort Bragg and Downtown Fayetteville, Would absolutely recommend to stay there!"
12737,347,This Airbnb is a hidden gem and we will bookmark for future traveling arrangements. The unit is located above the garage and offers a large private space and full private bathroom accessible in the 1st floor garage. Reginald responses promptly to questions and you can trust him as your Host. There are also a few fun table games and video games to play with the family for extra enjoyment.
12738,347,The place was clean and accurate. great stay!
12739,347,Cool place and super cost effective
12740,347,"Overall it wasn't bad. The communication was not the best, in the day time the room would get hot and the a/c that was there took a while to cool down the room."
12741,347,"Affordable, clean, and private. 👍🏽"
12742,347,"Room door keypad didn’t lock from outside room, I didn’t have to use the code just walked in the room. Room not as clean carpet had crumbs and walls not too clean."
12743,347,"Reginald’s place is exactly how it’s described. Much cheaper than a hotel and includes a microwave and fridge. The room is huge over a garage and the washroom/shower/washer and drier are down a flight of stairs and in the garage. Has two single beds and there is a double mattress that can be blown up with a pump and it’s quite comfortable. Make sure if you go out for the day you keep the AC on because the room can get quite hot if you don’t. Doesn’t take long for the room to get cool. We had a problem with check in however, Reginald dealt with the problem once contacted. Decent place to stay for the price! Thank you Reginald!"
12744,347,Reginald is the consonant professional
12745,347,Nice quiet place.
12746,347,Great place to stay.
12747,347,"Good host.. good communication.. safe, private, place"
12748,347,Reginald been a great host since I’ve been here!!
12749,347,"Safe neighborhood, private entrance, good and very reasonable and reliable host.. great for nursing travelers who work night shifts.. it’s very quiet during the day"
12750,347,"Clean, great place.. very nice/ safe / quiet/ neighborhood.. the room is nice and spacious.. very private…Good communication with the host .."
12751,347,"The room was just as described and we still managed to be amazed by it. The games provided great entertainment in lieu of an actual date night. I wasn't expecting a mini fridge and microwave so that was a pleasant surprise. The room did get warm during the day as mentioned but not unbearable. Once night fell, the room was comfortable and cool. I would stay here again if it was available when I was in the area. The only concern to be aware of is that the walls of the gate were very narrow and I almost hit the mirror of my Dodge 1500. Be careful when entering and exiting."
12752,347,The room was just as described. The host is very attentive and the house sits in a quiet neighborhood. We felt safe and the room was clean. There were several arcade games which we never got to enjoy but I imagine would have been fun to use if we had had the time. It does sleep 3. There are two twin beds and a full air mattress was provided for us.
12753,347,I had a peaceful stay. I had a wonderful stay. Which I needed. Thanks again.
12754,347,The room was nice and separated. The bed was comfortable. My only recommendation for people is to understand that it is a room above a garage and in turn will get quite warm during the day in the summer. Was a comfortable stay.
12755,347,Great place. Very comfortable. Recommended.
12756,347,Great stay! Reginald was a great host! Only downside of the rental was the light switch was downstairs & it was a little bit warm for the summertime because the fan goes off with the lights
12757,347,Good place with good host and convenient location
12758,347,It was nice
12759,347,"Great location, comfortable, everything as listed! You may need to run AC for a bit if you’re arriving on a hot day. Reginald is super responsive to any questions which is quite helpful!"
12760,347,"It’s perfect for a last minute plan or emergency. The room is what it describes, “Just a room, nothing special.” It was clean and spacious. I would like to mention instructions aren’t super clear but host was quick to respond to any questions."
12761,347,nice place to stay
12762,347,Great spacious room for a fantastic price
12763,347,"Just for a cheap room it was great! Two comfy beds, a couch, arcade games, and clean! It was a little hot, but once we put on the AC for a few hours it was fine."
12764,347,"Great room although I don’t like rooms with a lot of doors lol. The only negative thing I can say is the bathroom was in the garage. Other than that it was spectacular.

S.N.: you should think about putting some lights in the yard near the garage"
12765,347,I have stayed here before and came back on my way back home. It was a great stay for the night and the host is very nice and answer my question as quick as he could.
12766,347,Bathroom is downstairs in the garage is only thing that wasn’t ideal but the rest of the stay was good.
12767,347,Nice private location; very clean & spacious complete with some nostalgic games to play. Great response from the host! Would stay again!
12768,347,very close to Fort Bragg and easy to check in
12769,347,Nice place and clean
12770,347,Great place for the weekend. For a job related trip or just quiet visit to the area. Near Fayetteville University and many stores. Really nice.
12771,347,"get location, with a great host."
12772,347,"Reginald is a great host! I’ve stayed at his hut and the upstairs private room now and both are comfortable and clean. I was able to get work done and rest, all that you need in an Airbnb. Also, Reginald accommodated a specific request I had without hesitation. When I forgot an item he communicated quickly and I was able to go back and pick up after checking out. Highly recommend!"
12773,347,Cool little spot.
12774,347,Nice
12775,347,I love the place. It was what i have expected it to be like in the photos.
12776,347,Great for the value
12777,347,"The place is clean, warm and inviting and the host provided what I asked for. Like when I was a little chilly later on I just asked for an extra blanket and he told me where to get it right in the room. I slept like a baby. I also played a little Pac-Man😊I’ve used the location hut before, and was pleased with that place as well. It’s very convenient for my frequent work trips. Thanks Airbnb."
12778,347,"Not as clean as I would have hoped, which is worrying in a pandemic. The bathroom is downstairs and across the garage which I was not expecting. Also, the room was very cold and blankets were thin so dress warm. However, the host is very kind and helpful. Not a place I’d choose to stay for a long time, but if you just need a place to lay your head while passing through, this will do just fine"
12779,347,This loft was nice! I would recommend plus it’s close to fort Bragg. I would rent this room again.
12780,347,Spacious room over garage. Bathroom is a little inconvenient but worth the trip!
12781,347,Good clean spot. Very quiet and really enjoyed the yard
12782,347,"We enjoyed our stay at this location. Clean, nice and quiet and We was able to check in at the last minute. We were very pleased with the host as well. He was quite patient and informative with all the questions we had about the area. We were able to meet our colleagues on time this morning
Thank you"
12783,349,"This is a very private and comfortable space. I was in the area to visit family, so was not at Michelle's very much. I enjoyed the quiet, country setting. LOVE the holiday tree decorated for Easter."
12784,349,"Cute spot! Loved the chickens and all the decor! If I ever come thru that way, I’ll def stay with them again"
12785,349,this was an amazing living space environment full of love and very gracious hosts I plan on coming back as often as I can just to spend time in here they have the hippie loft to York and the other room the meditation room Fantastic 😊
12786,349,"Michelle greeted me as I arrived and ended up giving us a larger space than I expected. I liked the chickens and cozy atmosphere. She accommodated me and my little boy, my parents were supposed to keep my baby girl but she ended up coming too and Michelle accommodated the three of us! I look forward to returning in the future"
12787,349,"Michelle's place was very comfortable, felt very very safe for female travelers. I was on the drive to GA from NY and this was at the perfect location. The bed was super comfy and extra blankets were provided. The temperature of the room was perfect, and I fell asleep like a baby. Would stay here again!"
12788,349,Great place! Simple entry and private surroundings. Very comfy room and bed.
12789,349,"The whole place was quaint, quiet, and welcoming."
12790,349,Nice and easy check in and nice place to stop for a night!
12791,349,Absolutely awesome cool comfy place and stay....loved it !!!
12792,349,very nice ladies! check in was easy and Michelle was available to answer questions quickly. The property is gorgeous and secluded. Great place to rest
12793,349,"Comfy and cozy, I slept like a log and woke up to the beautiful autumn scenery"
12794,349,"This is a good place for one person to stay for the night. Michelle graciously agreed for my husband and I to stay in her airbnb even though her listing states: one single female. It is better suited for 1 person as the room is quite small and in a mobile home. It was perfect for our quick overnight in Statesville, NC."
12795,349,Great place to get some rest on your travels quiet and friendly environment!
12796,349,This place is AWESOME! Live chickens and great atmosphere. Definitely a chill vibe and lovely hosts. Would highly recommend.
12797,350,"clear instructions, convenient location. Super comfortable bed and linens. Perfect temperature and has a ceiling fan. Gracious host. Thank you!!! 10/10 🙂"

12800,350,Great place! Friendly hosts.
12801,350,Thank you for having you in your home
12802,350,Slept like a baby and will be coming back soon!
12803,350,I had a very relaxing stay. Will def book again.
12804,350,Excellent place to stay
12805,350,"Don't be fooled by the bedroom photo -- it's a much nicer bed and room than they show. There's a large chest of drawers and a large closet as well. Manish has provided an easy-to-move desk in the closet that was very useful for doing my computer work in the evenings. As others have said, the place was spotless. The home is in a new neighborhood of fairly expensive homes. I felt very safe. The combination lock on the front door allowed me to get in and out any time I wanted without needing to disturb the family. I will definitely stay here again if I get to come back to the area next year!"
12806,350,As usual - very easy in & out because of the room/bathroom are right at front entrance of home. Great place to stay!
12807,350,I love the place! It’s worth it!
12808,350,Manish and his family are great hosts.
12809,350,Great place to spend the night.
12810,350,Tha k you for accommodating me at short notice.

12814,350,"Thanks for the stay, I slept good."
12815,350,Thank you for hosting my mom! She had a pleasant stay here.
12816,350,Manish's place I have stayed several times and as usual place was great and very clean. Love staying here when working in Raleigh.
12817,350,Clean and beautiful space to come back to after the day’s done to wind down and get some good sleep. The host was very kind and welcoming when I arrived.
12818,350,Excellent place to stay while visiting Apex.
12819,350,"I will definitely be staying here again. It was quiet, she was very accommodating and friendly. Its simple, perfect for my needs."
12820,350,"Manish is so responsive , kind and nice….liked the stay"
12821,350,"As this is a good stay for me - safe neighborhood, quiet and great location!"
12822,350,"Manish and his family made me feel welcome, and were very friendly. I will stay here again on future visits to the area."
12823,350,Great place to rest our heads after a night of exploring the city! Easy check-in and friendly host
12824,350,"Private room, great value, easy check in. I highly recommend this spot."
12825,350,"Bed was comfy, but the smell was absolutely unbearable. It kept me up at night and stuck to my clothes. DONT go here unless you like living in a smelly Indian restaurant."
12826,350,Great place to stay and good location
12827,350,Great place for just a bed
12828,350,"Wow! What a beautiful home! Manish was quick to reply and very accommodating to my needs! The room had everything that was listed and so did the bathroom. Great entry right inside the front door and with a keypad! Self check in was great, but the door was opened for me, which was so nice while I was carrying all my luggage!! Perfect location too. It only took a few minutes to get to a restaurant for dinner, and 8 minutes to The Evermore, which is where the wedding I attended was. Couldn’t have been a better stay! Just book it!"
12829,350,"2nd time here, super clean and quiet"
12830,350,Very relaxing and Stress Free stay. Very nice having the bedroom virtually steps from the front door.
12831,350,Once again no hassle stay and great location ...
12832,350,Manish is great! He has a nice very nice place in a nice neighborhood. I highly recommend the stay here!
12833,350,As usual a great stay and always comfortable.
12834,350,"Very considerate host, with a lovely family. A very quiet and safe neighborhood. A beautiful home with a very clean and pleasant bathroom and comfortable bed."
12835,350,Perfect stay!
12836,350,"This will be my 4th time staying here. Always very clean and Manish is very accommodating with towels, iron and a great safe neighborhood. Another nice thing about this place is the AirBnb room is right by the front door entrance - so basically you do not have to go thru house to get to your room,

Always a good night stay."
12837,350,"Have stayed at Manish’s place several times now. It is my go to place to stay while I’m working in the area when it is available. Always a comfortable, pleasant stay."
12838,350,nice Airbnb! nice people!
12839,350,All was as they said it would be I had a great stay with great communication from host I recommend to all!
12840,350,Pleasant stay warm family
12841,350,Cooperative and friendly host ! Perfect location for my schedule.
12842,350,"Manish was very welcoming. Excellent communication. Clean bedroom and bathroom. Comfortable bed.
If you are sensitive to cooking odors, just be aware that the smell of Indian cuisine will be present in your bedroom at all times.
However there are windows with screens to open, the bedroom is on the street side and sidewalk side of the house.
No offense meant. It’s just a fact for those of you who would prefer a neutral odor in the bedroom where you are sleeping."
12843,350,"Hi Mary,
We are sorry for the trouble!
As this has happened for the very first time, we’ll take extra precautions from next time.
Thank you for your feedback!"
12844,350,As usual this host and his family are great hosts. Super quiet neighborhood and very to Highway 64 and shopping/restaurants. The bedroom & bathroom are very clean as usual during my stays. It is very hassle free. Look forward to staying again....
12845,350,Nice house and great rooms
12846,350,Stay was excellent!
12847,350,"Great stay! Very clean, well furnished, and very kind family!"
12848,350,Perfect place! Simple and clean. Just as described and pictured. Easy to access right inside the front door. Great neighborhood!
12849,350,Great room! Very comfortable!
12850,350,I sleep like an Angel 😇❤️ Great Stay! Everything was clean and very convenient to commute to work! Thank you very much Manish sure is a Superhost!
12851,350,Beautiful home! Highly recommended
12852,350,"Again thank you and your family for their hospitality! I always have a nice, quiet and comfortable stay. BTW very quiet and safe neighborhood. The Host ""Manish"" is awesome!"
12853,350,Room and bathroom were both clean with all the needed supplies. Exactly as advertised and photos posted.
12854,350,This was my second stay with Manish. It’s a clean & quiet bedroom with private bathroom right next door. Easy entrance right inside front door. Nice family in a new residential neighborhood. No hesitation recommending.
12855,350,Always a pleasant stay.😊
12856,350,This is a great place to stay! Exactly as described and host was incredibly friendly and responsive. Will definitely stay again!
12857,350,"For all traveler's Manish's place has a great location and is very easy to find. The place is always clean and very easy to get in and out since it is near the front door where you enter. This is helpful especially if you have to leave early. Street parking is very nice and you will not have any problems.
Thanks again Manish for you hospitality!

Regards,

Rich"
12858,350,"Very clean, quiet location."
12859,350,I will be back.
12860,350,Always a pleasant stay in such a wonderful area.
12861,350,Another great stay with Manish! I’m sure I’ll stay again soon!
12862,350,This is my 2nd time staying here. Room is very convenient to front door so when leaving early you do not have to walk thru the home. Bathroom is just outside the your room. Clean and comfy again - Thanks Manish - will always stay here if available.
12863,350,Simple clean and neat bedroom and bathroom. Great for single travelers!
12864,350,"Manish’s place was exactly as described. Easy check in. Private room with private bath. Clean, quiet and comfortable. Nice neighborhood, great location. Room is just inside the front door, so you don’t have to go through the whole house to access your room."
12865,350,I really enjoyed staying at Manish's place. You have your own private bathroom and bedroom as listed. The neighborhood is very safe too!
12866,350,It was nice to meet with Manish and some of his family members. And it has a cabinet to bout my bag on top of the cabinets. The house is in a good spot to RTP area. Overall is a great and valuable to choose this Airbnb.
12867,350,Great place to stay very quiet neighborhood. Bed is comfy and adjacent bathroom very convenient. Another plus - Room is on 1st floor and in the front of the house just at the front door. I look forward to staying here again!
12868,350,Love this place.❤️
12869,350,"Well worded listing that describes exactly what you get and don't get. This offering was exactly what we needed as we spent very little time at the home. The bed was comfortable and although others have commented on the height, it was perfectly adequate for us. The bathroom was private and offered all the necessary amenities we needed. We were given towels and the toilet paper was good quality. We will definitely look for this listing again when we need to stay in the area."
12870,350,"Nice place to stay but the bed is really firm, so if you’re not used to a super firm bed, it can be tough to sleep on"
12871,350,"Really comfortable place to stay. Strongly recommend, great location, comfortable and quiet."
12872,350,Such a nice place to stay and easy to find with a simple checkin. Comfortable bed. Clean bedroom and bathroom.
12873,350,"Manish is a great host, balances his interactions with you and your need for privacy. I really liked the place - clean and comfortable. If I am in the area, I would certainly like to stay here. One thing to note- there is grocery or restaurants in a walking distance from the place, you need to have a car to get around."
12874,350,The host responded quickly. The room was comfortable and clean. Had a quiet night. Excellent experience.
12875,350,Everything they promised-offered is what you’ll get. Very good place to stay! I recommend it.
12876,350,Very nice private bedroom and bathroom. Keyless entry with code.
12877,350,"Nice simple place! In a great location too, family was really nice as well. Room is situated in the front of the house, which kept things pretty quiet and I was able to work remotely with no connection issues."
12878,350,The space is private and the bathroom is too. Your not next to nobody’s room which I really liked. I would book here again. Mannish let’s you control the thermostat to guest liking which is a plus but I didn’t need to. The room was cool and it had a fan.
12879,350,"What a great place to stay in the Cary or Apex area. Clean, comfortable, and quiet. I would definitely recommend."
12880,350,"Greg, thank you for being a great guest! And thank you for the kind remarks! Would love to host you again."
12881,350,"Nice clean bedroom & bathroom! Both are right as you enter the home, so you don’t feel like you’re intruding on Manish and his family. Manish went out of his way to make sure I was comfortable and had everything I needed."
12882,350,"A clean, comfortable room and private bathroom whenever you need a stopover!"
12883,350,"A very nice house in a great neighborhood. Great communication, the bedroom and the bathroom were absolutely spotless, the bathroom had a fantastic walk-in shower, and the bed was very comfortable. wi-Fi was fast enough to stream video.

One thing I did want to mention, that might be an issue if someone has mobility problems. There are three steps with a railing to get to the house, and, the bed is a platform bed that sits very low to the floor. It was not a problem for me at all, but it might be an issue for somebody with mobility problems.

For me, it was a fantastic stay, and I would gladly stay here again the next time I’m in the area. Thank you."
12884,350,The place is located in a really nice neighborhood.. with lots of sidewalks if you like going for a walk. It is just as described very clean and perfect to spend a quite night.. The bed was very comfortable.. Thanks!
12885,350,"Was absolutely amazing, and a great respite for a weary traveler!"
12886,350,Manish's place is a good stop over for a private and comfortable stay.
12887,350,Good good good. I will be back again.
12888,350,Love my stay here. The house and room have been perfect and the lakes and forest around are beautiful. Definitely recommend.
12889,350,This room is clean and private. Highly recommend
12890,350,"Very safe, quiet neighborhood.
Comfy bed, but low to ground. Kids in house, which I didn’t know when booked.
was 2 guests for 2 nights, and there was no tp in bathroom beside the 1/2 roll on holder. I suggested host be sure there is some xtra under sink for guests next time."
12891,350,Super awesome place ; very comfortable stay at a great price. I was there for my business meeting at the RTP and needed a clean and quiet place to crash for 2 nights. This place was exactly what I needed. This was private room with private bath. Very well maintained! Superhost indeed!
12892,350,"Great stay, I’d stay again"
12893,350,"This was one of the best airbnb's I've ever stayed at! Great host, location, room, and amenities! I hope I can stay here again the next time I'm in town."
12894,350,"Great value, clean, good bed and good shower pressure. Good location for access to Cary and Apex. Make sure to read the description-it is a room in a family home with kids so I brought earbuds to go to bed early."
12895,350,"Super comfy, clean, and quiet - highly recommend"
12896,350,This is a spacious and comfortable private bedroom and bathroom if that's all you're looking for.
12897,350,Nice and comfortable stay! Everything is as advertised. The room does get cold on lower temperature nights. I had a great experience with privacy!
12898,350,Beautiful home. Manish & family were very mindful and respectful.
12899,350,Manish is an awesome host and I would gladly stay again in his house!
12900,350,It’s a beautiful home but the keyless entry does not work. I slept in a fleece with a hoody over it plus under the blanket and was still cold. The keyless entry is broke so I had to ring the bell and wait for someone to open the door. I was also asked to be in a certain time as if there is a curfew. I had a polar pop and it was still ice cold in the morning
12901,350,"Great place to stay. very clean and cosy.
I would highly recommend this stay.
Thank you to Manish and his family."
12902,350,"If you're looking for just a clean, comfortable room and a private bathroom, that's what you'll find at Manish's place."
12903,350,"Simple and clean, easy to reach by car from the airport."
12904,354,Loved the location to my final destination; the history of her home which has been in the family for generations.
12905,354,"What a peaceful place to stay.
Free from distractions and the host Rebecca was very kind and friendly."
12906,354,Exactly as advertised. Clean and tidy. I will look to book again when I’m back that way.
12907,354,wonderful. will stay again.
12908,354,wonderful as always. will be staying again.
12909,354,"Of all the places I have ever stayed, airbnb's, bnb's and even hotels, this was the nicest stay ever. The host was always nearby if I needed her. The home was a very old farmhouse that had been updated. There were so many nice extras: a coffee maker with coffee pods, well appointed bathroom, even salt and pepper shakers. Rebecca had prepared lists of restaurant suggestions. I needed nothing. Wish I could have stayed longer but she had a guest already booked at the end of my stay. If you are lucky enough to get a reservation, you will have a wonderful stay in a private room with its own

entrance and no sharing of a bathroom."
12910,354,beautiful place and area
12911,354,Great place to stay.
12912,354,A great stay at a reasonable price. Hope to be back soon!
12913,354,Wonderful stay. Highly recommend.
12914,354,"This was a beautiful,quiet place to stay. Host was very responsive to messages. The room had alot of nice personal touches. I enjoyed reading about the history of the farm house. The room and private bathroom was very clean. The bed slept really well. There was a coffee maker, microwave, and mini fridge. There was plenty of towels and wash cloths. A beautiful porch to relax on. it was one of the best rooms to rent I have ever stayed in. I would highly recommend."
12915,354,Thank you for your 5 star review! You're always welcome here!
12916,354,"With me working the graveyard shift into the wee hours of the morning, it was very nice to have a quiet area where the place is located. I was very appreciative of the thoughtfulness of not running their tractor and doing work around the farm so I could get some rest. Thank you very much for that!"
12917,354,"Absolutely fantastic stay, wonderful & kind host, and perfect for our needs.
We were only staying the night to rest during a long road trip, but it was in a beautiful location, Rebecca went above and beyond in all possible amenities and we would definitely stay again!"
12918,354,"Excellent… Lord willing I’ll be coming back again and again…
Been here several times, my home away from home… First choice 🙏🏻✝️"
12919,354,Wonderful place to stay. Very private. Large room with nice amenities. Very peaceful for a great nights sleep.
12920,354,Very quiet and secluded area. The room was had its own entrance.
12921,354,"Amazing place, super close to Virginia International Raceway. The home is rich in history. A must stay if you going to vir."
12922,354,"Rebecca was a gracious host that made our stay memorable. The room was cozy, and the surroundings were spectacular! We were there during peak colors in October and the yard is beautiful! There were abundant amenities in the room including coffee, tea, toiletries (in case we forgot), and a lovely sitting porch that we were not there long enough to enjoy. There were also several brochures and menus of local restaurants and attractions provided.
On our way out in the morning, we were able to meet our hosts and they were friendly and helpful, even giving us suggestions on local attraction to visit. If we are ever in the area again, we would not hesitate to book at the farm again."
12923,354,"Our second stay at the Page farm was just as pleasant as the first.
Rebecca is a very nice hostess. She was friendly, helpful, and informative.
The guest room was clean, comfortable, and quiet.
We would definitely like to stay there again."
12924,354,We were back here in a week. Very highly recommended.
12925,354,Was a short stay but thankyou for a nice quiet and privant room
12926,354,"Rebecca is a very nice hostess. She was friendly, helpful, and informative.
The guest room was clean, comfortable, and quiet.
We've already scheduled another stay there."
12927,354,"OK, you must stay at Page farm, hosted by Rebecca, anytime you are in that part of North Carolina. Just about the best AirBnb experience my wife and I have ever had, and we have experienced many. We were in the addition added in 1909 to the original farm house built in 1828, and which has been in the same family ever since. All updated and comfortable and clean. Great value. Beautiful countryside. Do not pass up the opportunity to stay there."
12928,354,We were so lucky to have found this listing and great time staying here. There is so much history and charm it has to offer. We would love to come back.
12929,354,Very comfortable.
12930,354,"We really enjoyed our one night stay in the farmhouse room. We had everything we needed for a comfortable, safe stay. We will be back."
12931,354,Excellent as usual.
12932,354,Idyllic country setting.
12933,354,"Rebecca has done a wonderful job hosting me. I was very busy, and she attended to every of my needs. The room is well equipped with basically anything you can think of, with a ton of thoughtful considerations within the room. Great experience would strongly recommend."
12934,354,The hosts are wonderful and the room was super comfortable. It was a really nice experience that I would recommend to anyone looking to stay in the area :)
12935,354,"I had a wonderful stay. Everything was just as advertised. Rebecca was wonderful and made sure i had everything i needed. I felt welcome and at home during my stay.
The property is absolutely beautiful!"
12936,354,"Rebecca was an absolute pleasure to deal with. The communications and hospitality were great. I had something from work come up and i was unable to make the trip but Rebecca was extremely understanding and accommodating. The interactions that i had over the last week confirm to me why she is an outstanding host.

I know without a shadow of a doubt the next time im in there area I'll be checking with her first.

Thank you for everything and your understanding!"
12937,354,Best place I've stayed in a long time. Beautiful place with a great history. 10 out of 10 would recommend. We will be coming back I'm sure!
12938,354,Had a track day at VIR and this was perfect! Less than half hour away. Hospitality was excellent and the room was needed before and after track. Highly recommend.
12939,354,"This lovely location is well worth the visit. Great spot, clean and comfortable. Cold AC unit! A wonderful family farm that we are so glad we got to visit."
12940,354,"Great people and a great space!
The location was perfect for my husband working in the area. Everything was just as described. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom spacious. Rebecca was wonderful host! Definitely would recommend this place!"
12941,354,It was great!
12942,354,I had another successful stay! Beautiful place and no issues with the WIFI at all! I absolutely love this house and the room and cannot wait to be back. Rebecca and her husband are so accommodating and address any needs that might arise. I absolutely love staying here and will definitely be back. Wonderful place and wonderful hosts!
12943,354,Nice place to stay . Will definitely come back again!!
12944,354,Best Airbnb we have ever rented. Above and beyond what was advertised. Beautiful room and home with lots of fresh clean air. You won’t be disappointed!!
12945,354,This is one of the best stays I have ever had! This was my first time staying in an Airbnb for a longer stay and they addressed every concern I had and accommodated my needs. I was amazed by the friendliness and attention to detail from the beginning to the end of my stay and these are some of the nicest people you can stay with. They have a beautiful house and property and the room was quite nice to relax in after a long day at the racetrack. I only had the slightest issue with the wifi connection but then again I am pretty demanding on networks as I am a video editor but DO NOT let that deter you from your stay as it was an absolute pleasure staying with them and will definitely be back whenever I come through the area again!! I HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone and look forward to my future stays!!
12946,354,"Book your stay while you can. I wish I had extended. The privacy is perfect, Rebecca has true southern hospitality, and the farm is so charming."
12947,354,"A nice, quiet place to stay! Feels like home!"
12948,354,"All I can say is: Rebecca’s place feels like home! Rebecca has been great with communicating. She greeted me upon arrival and showed me the room and even left hand written notes of places to eat locally/in Danville. I think my favorite part was the hand written note of the Farms history….thank you for sharing!
Thank you for opening up your home to me and I hope to come back soon :)"
12949,354,I’m looking forward - Lord willing to return…
12950,354,Just had another perfect stay at this beautiful farm! Couldn't ask for anything more!
12951,354,Another perfect stay!
12952,354,"What a lovely home and beautiful setting! Rebecca is a wonderful host. The room is clean, well-stocked, and super quiet. I look forward to visiting again."
12953,354,"Another perfect stay at the farm! As always, wonderful, accommodating hostess and very relaxing, cozy, clean room!!"
12954,354,Rebecca is always a wonderful hostess and this time she went above and beyond to make sure I would be safe traveling to her home! She kept me updated on the road conditions and made sure the room was nice and cozy when I got there!! I always love staying on this beautiful farm!!
12955,354,Just had another relaxing stay at this beautiful farmhouse! The hostess continues to be so very accommodating and keeps it feeling just like home!! I love staying here!!!
12956,354,A lot of Family Love and at home feeling… Recommend Highly
12957,354,The room was very clean and Rebecca is a fantastic host. I would absolutely stay here again!
12958,354,"What a cozy and wonderful orchard stay if you’re in the area. Rebecca was pleasant and made sure we were comfortable. She put coffee and various teas in the room. It was a clean room and comfortable bed.
Highly recommend her Airbnb to future guests. The drive from her place was enjoyable too."
12959,354,"Wonderful host!
Enjoyed hearing some of the home’s history, and sipping coffee on the front porch, listening to the songbirds in the trees on the property!"
12960,354,A beautiful area of the country and a great room.
12961,354,This is an amazing location!
12962,354,Great experience! Be sure to enjoy the wonderful front porch.
12963,354,"It had been a while since I first stayed here, but everything was as I remembered. This is a gem of a place to stay if you are in the area."
12964,354,Wow. Great beautiful quiet location 20 min from Danville and 30 min from Greensboro. Just what peace and relaxation needed! Rebecca is lovely host…knows Danville. Thank you!😊
12965,354,This was a comfortable room just as described. Enough space to relax and enjoy.
12966,354,Just had another relaxing stay at the farmhouse! It is such a peaceful environment and the hosts are wonderfully accommodating!
12967,354,"Great, friendly, and clean place! Definitely recommend!"
12968,354,Had a great time there.
12969,354,This is an amazing place to stay! The farm is so well preserved with such history and neat old buildings! It offers a peaceful and relaxing environment and makes me feel right at home!
12970,354,Fantastic place to stay. Highly recommended. Will try to stay here in future trips to the area.
12971,354,"Had another great month here at Rebecca's place. She has a great monthly rate, room is clean with microwave and mini-fridge, house is in a nice quiet location, perfect for hiking and bike riding. Wifi is spot on, fast and efficient. Rebecca makes you feel like you are part of the family and she has great tips on eateries and siteseeing around Yanceyville and Danville. I would definitely stay here again."
12972,354,"Wonderful place. Clean, quiet, very comfortable — it was a perfect stay."
12973,354,"A beautiful farm with a welcoming owner ! It was such a treat to stay here and enjoy the quiet, peacefulness and rolling hills. It is a unique place with a long history in the family. All the facilities are modern and convenient, the best of the new and the old. Rebecca, thank you for being such a wonderful host!"
12974,354,A great room out in the country with plenty of privacy. Rebecca was a great host and made me feel right at home.
12975,354,"This is my second trip to Page Farm! Was a great stay. Clean, quiet and comfortable. Bonus I got to give all the pets to a cute farm kitty on the porch 🥰"
12976,354,"Rebecca thought of everything for her traveling guests. I was greeted by both Rebecca & her husband Bob when I drove up. They were engaging and fun to talk with about the property and the surrounding area. I even walked around one evening, visiting the chickens and their friendly Great Pyrenees Dog, ""Opal"". The spacious porch provided a peaceful place to sit and read. Inside, the room had everything I needed, as if Rebecca knew what might help provide more comfort. The room has its own very quiet ""mini split"" type of A/C and heat so you can keep the room exactly the way you want without the roar of a window unit. The bed was extremely comfortable, the shower and entire bathroom appeared brand new with plenty of space and light. The one cup at a time coffee maker was very nice, but even better were provided various coffees and teas for getting your morning going or just relaxing. I had mentioned that I loved fresh eggs and was gifted a dozen upon leaving. They were great!! I also utilized their restaurant reccomendations for the city of Danville (about 15 minutes North) and was very pleased with both. Finding a good restaurant can always be a challenge when traveling. Her suggestions was spot on! I would gladly stay in this Air B & B again and look forward to the next opportunity."
12977,354,Rebecca is warm and welcoming! Her farm was a home away from home for me while I was working in Danville. This is a special place!
12978,354,Had such a great stay at the Pane Farm! Looking forward to my next stay : )
12979,354,Rebecca is a Fabulous host! The 200 year old farmhouse and out buildings remind me of cherished days I spent at my grandparents' house. Easy evenings sitting on the porch listening to the birds is a great way to unwind!
12980,354,My favorite place to stay near Danville!
12981,354,"Wonderful people, history, home, area & host."
12982,355,"Karla was very friendly and very helpful. Karla maintained the place really neat and clean. She also gave me some great suggestions about best local restaurants.
We had a great stay at Karla's home."
12983,355,"Thank you! Clean home 🏡 and friendly host!

Only recommendation for guest is to have a car or spend some cash on an Uber to explore!"
12984,355,"Super cute, clean and comfortable stay. First time staying in someone’s home without a totally private entrance (so, I was honestly a little skeptical), but it was very nice and pleasant; beautiful and clean house in a nice neighborhood - I felt right at home and would definitely stay here again. Thanks, Karla!!!"
12985,355,Nice and clean place! Very well maintained. Karla is a great host and she constantly communicates to ensure smooth check-in and stay.
12986,355,"I’ve stayed in a lot of short term rentals now and this space lists among the top. Beautiful new home in new development. Guest has entire third floor to themselves with their own full bathroom. Karla has provided everything you need there from bath supplies to coffee and kitchen supplies. Everything is new and very clean.
Karla is also easy to communicate with and very friendly. Highly recommend!"
12987,355,"Karla’s place was great. The bed was comfortable. Check in was easy with the coded keypad. Good location, convenient to everything. Would definitely recommend if you need to stay in the Raleigh area."

👍🏾👍🏾"
12990,355,"Having a rough start to my holiday vacation, I’m very grateful that my this Airbnb found me. I love that this was the place I stayed at for the first of 2023! This Airbnb is a gem at a wonderful price! Karla was wonderfully welcoming and made my 6 night stay feel comfortable. Having to get work done on my laptop, I spent quite a bit of time in the house. The room was clean, cozy, relaxing and smelled very nice! I used the toaster and coffee maker every morning! From the very clear and concise check in instructions to all the little details in the room, you could tell it was well thought out to make you feel at home. And I did. I would recommend it and will definitely stay again when I’m back in town. Thank you Karla"
12991,355,Karla was such a kind and friendly host! She had great communication and her house was very clean and quiet
12992,355,The room at Karla's was perfect! It had everything I could've asked for and way more. Karla was proactive in communication and made sure I had everything I needed. A super seamless and cozy stay!

12997,355,Immaculate. Great location. Great value. Perfect space.
12998,355,Karla is an excellent host! Provided accurate instructions and went above and beyond to ensure I had everything I needed for my stay. Would definitely recommend.
12999,355,"Karla was very attentive from the get go.
We appreciated her desire to make our stay comfortable and hassle free. Check in was simple and parking in the driveway was easy.

The loft was pretty clean and having the bathroom attached to the loft made our stay private and convenient. In addition, we were able to lock the door that led up to our loft area. The bathroom amenities were great. The linens and towels were fresh. We didn't need the toaster or the microwave but it was nice to have. We took advantage of the coffee in the morning. The loft was open and spacious and there was plenty of closet space too.
Overall, we enjoyed our 1 night stay. Would definitely stay again."
13000,355,Always a pleasant to stay at Karla’s home. Highly recommended!
13001,355,Another great stay with Karla. Thank you so much for everything! Love to stay again.

13010,355,Great overall experience. Thanks.
13011,355,"We had a great 3 night stay at Karla’s beautiful home!

Location was perfect - 20 minute drive to Raleigh and in a safe/quiet neighborhood. The loft was very clean and spacious. Coffee bar was a great bonus, as was being able to park in the driveway. I’d be more than happy to pay twice the cost as it would be totally worth it.

Best part was Karla. Very responsive, helpful, thoughtful and kind. A total gem!

I’ll def book here again if I’m in the area :o)"
13012,355,"Karla was a great host! Responded very quickly, and was very accommodating to my needs. Check-in instructions were super detailed and helpful.
The place was super clean and well stocked. It is exactly the same as shown in the picture, great value for money and great location. I could not have asked for a better location. Overall a wonderful place; I would definitely come back here again."

13018,357,I love it. I am staying for the whole summer.
13019,357,I’ve stayed here before and you really can’t beat this for the price. Very nice quiet area for a quick visit or longer. The hut is nice. I also like the other rentals they provide. I’m have no complaints. I really had no problems with this location. ☺️
13020,357,Thanks
13021,357,Love it Here
13022,357,Wonderful Host and Place to Stay
13023,357,I enjoyed my privacy and accommodations were fantastic along with the price. Reginald is very prompt and clearly communicated with me
13024,357,we were notified just before check in water line busted and no water to tiny house? he did offer us the bonus room above the garage which was adequate for what our needs were. location is great and close to everything. home is in a nice area lots of dining options and fort bragg post is close . great place and price is within budget
13025,357,"Aside from the weather being a huge factor with the water supply. It was a good stay. He even provided another room for us without up-charging and even refunded us for one of the days we stayed. Personally I would've liked the 3 days we went without water refunded, but for what I budgeted for it was a win for me."
13026,357,The place was a bit cold
13027,357,"If you are looking for a place with very little standards, this is it. It is just as advertised no frills. I would not recommend this place to any of my friends. Not very clean spiderwebs and the bed felt like cardboard I was afraid to look."
13028,357,It was good
13029,357,Great place that is clean to sleep for a couple nights
13030,357,Great place
13031,357,"Very affordable for the amount of time i stayed and the budget i was on. The place wasnt the cleanest, but overall a good stay."

13034,357,"Thank you again, I enjoyed my stay"
13035,357,I enjoyed the stay. The location is great. It is quite and cozy. I would recommend this place to anyone. Thank you for letting me stay at your residence.
13036,357,"The Hut is as described! It was a great value for the price and I’d stay there again. Another reviewer mentioned the bed didn’t have blankets just sheets, but during our stay there were plenty of bed linens and towels and lots of thoughtful touches (like artfully arranged plates and cups in the kitchen area). I’d recommend it for anyone staying in Fayetteville!"
13037,357,"Reginald’s place is exactly as described - clean, comfortable, good accessibility for visiting someone on base, and a great value! It was perfect for our needs."
13038,357,"Loved the place, very quite and relaxing"
13039,357,Reginald was absolutely amazing and accommodating in every aspect. The space was much larger than expected and it offered exactly what I needed. The home is minutes from everything in town and in a good neighborhood. Thanks for making this a home away from home. I have more trips to make in the area so I’ll definitely be back.
13040,357,"Good place to lay your head. Bed is really soft and good secluded location . Just needs some lights outside, but would definitely stay again when I am in the area. Nice and clean, just what we needed for the weekend."
13041,357,"This was a perfect stay for us during our son’s high school graduation as we were flying in from TX and our first option declined our dates.

The place was clean upon arrival, great location for us, and communication with Reginald was outstanding being that we had to add a day the flexibility was accommodating.

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a peaceful, comfy, and homey stay."
13042,357,"Great place , as listed would stay again ."
13043,357,Great stay as usual.
13044,357,Great place. Just what we needed.
13045,357,"Just wanted to thank Reginald for his quick responses and actions on a few items that I messaged him about. The place is a great little house to rent for whatever may take you to Fayetteville. I’m personally here working and it was easy, quite and comfortable!"
13046,357,"don't get me wrong there were some unexpected situations around the house but for the most part Reginald was always on point to assist. It taught my family and I how to live minimalistic, which in turn helped us toward appreciation!!"
13047,357,"Beautiful clean place, much larger than expected and nice host."
13048,357,"Quiet, clean and safe place to stay."
13049,357,Great little place clean and comfy
13050,357,"Awesome place, one of my favorites!!"

13052,357,A great place to stay if you just need to sleep and shower. The host was very kind and prompt.
13053,357,"Great place. Peaceful environment. Very helpful.
Overall wonderful stay."
13054,357,"Great value, good location. Close to the military base, shopping center with Macy’s and other big stores and restaurants near, a theater, FSU. Also games for you and kids. Quiet place."
13055,357,Great
13056,357,"Cool little place, nice if you just want a spot to crash and take a shower, it’s really all you need."
13057,357,Very nice for the price very comfortable and roomy
13058,357,"This was an excellent, simple, low maintenance stay. It does get a little chilly, but the host provided two space heaters that came in pretty clutch (do not run them at the same time, you WILL trip the circuit breaker). 5/5 for me."
13059,357,Super quaint little place to rest
13060,357,"Nice quiet little place, had some issues with roaches and shower went cold quick, but it was a nice place and better than a hotel. Thank you!"
13061,357,Nice quiet place. Great area and not to far from my family when I visit. Definitely recommend if you don't need many things to get through the weekend.
13062,357,best place to stay
13063,357,Great place
13064,357,"A perfect stay for someone visiting near fort Bragg not wanting to break the bank. Located in a safe and quiet neighborhood. Great place, quick communication and good times!"
13065,357,"Very quiet place! I enjoyed this hut so much! Reginald was very accommodating, would stay again!"
13066,357,Thanks! This place is great!
13067,357,"The place was very nice and comfortable. The only downfall is that there wasn’t an actual blanket, just sheets."
13068,357,"This was a great stay at an excellent price, truly diamond in the rough. I went in not knowing what to expect but everything exceeded my expectations. They had good communication if I needed anything or had any questions, Wi-Fi, AC, quiet and peaceful area in a central location. I had great stay and if I ever need a place in or around Fayetteville I'll be checking the dates here first."
13069,357,Everything that is advertised. Perfect for easy and basic stay
13070,357,"The hut stay was exactly as described and expected. I chose this place because it was down the street from my family so I do plan on staying there again.
One morning we lost power but Reginald took care of it quickly. If you are just looking for a place to shower and rest, then I recommend this rental."
13071,357,Thank you! Reginald is awesome and the cabin is perfect
13072,357,"Good place, near Bragg. Nice place to hang your hat a few nights."
13073,357,Thank you! Awesome place!
13074,357,very accurate listing no bells and whistles but nice place to sleep!!
13075,357,Awesome!!
13076,357,This place is awesome!
13077,357,"It was really nice and cozy place. Easy to locate, access! quiet, clean. Basically has everything needed. Close to the base, I would recommend my friend to stay !"
13078,357,"Clean, cute, and exactly as advertised!"
13079,357,Great place!!!
13080,357,"It is exactly what Reginald says in the description. A place to sleep, and that's about it. Good value for what it is, but if you're looking for more, look elsewhere."
13081,357,Thank you!! Great place!
13082,357,Very private & cozy little place to sleep for a night or two. Reginald was extremely quick with his response time. Enjoyed my stay!
13083,357,The fuel shortage put me in a bind and Reginald gave me a night to help.. The very definition of grace. Thank you.
13084,357,Awesome place! Host is amazing!
13085,357,Loved our stay!
13086,357,Nice little house all to yourself! I enjoyed my stay!
13087,357,Thank you! The place and host rock!
13088,357,"This hut was perfect for a weekend visit. Nice, clean and cool. Towels and extra blankets were provided. Also, Reginald was very quick to respond to our messages."
13089,357,The place and Reginald are the greatest!
13090,357,Thank you!!
13091,357,Reginald is a wonderful host and the apartment is perfect! Thanks!
13092,357,Great place too stay an worth the money for the stay
13093,357,"This is a nice space to stay for a stop over. It was clean and large enough, with a coffee maker and a hot plate!"
13094,357,"Great value for your money. Place is, as described, just a place to sleep. We arrived late at night, slept, and left in the morning, and for those purposes, this was perfect. I don't think we would book it for a longer period of time though. It's a little too simple for that."
13095,357,Great place! Thank you!!
13096,357,the home was a cute little space very comfortable and clean. I got more than I bargained for. 😊
13097,357,"Very close to Fort Bragg, very easy check-in and clean place."
13098,357,This place is awesome! Excellent host too!
13099,357,Reginald was a great host and place was as described. Great location. And easy checkin. Will stay here again if I travel here in the future
13100,357,"Nice space, clean and comfortable. Easy check in and no hassle at all."
13101,357,I was expecting a rustic experience at the property based on the property description but was bothered by a smell in the property and some stains on the carpet. The shower rod was not secured in the bathroom and fell down. Guests should know there is no heat/ac. There was an electric radiator in the bedroom that did a good job of heating up the room. The bed was too soft for my preference. Property was a bit hard to find in the dark.
13102,357,"The hut is a nice, clean private place to rest in a safe peaceful neighborhood. Will definitely book it again if available when in town."
13103,357,Thank you! Great place!!
13104,357,We stayed at Reginald's home on our way to Florida. The location was perfect and the home was easy to find. We only stayed the night but enjoyed our stay.
13105,357,Thank you! Great place!
13106,357,Really nice and perfect for a little get away! Only minor thing would be don’t go with two other girls. You will have NO hot water lol
13107,357,Great place! I really enjoy staying here. Reginald is a great host!
13108,357,"Wonderful place, one of my favorites!"
13109,357,This is a great place to stay for the weekend or if you're just passing through. Reginald was prompt in answering any questions we had in a hospitable manner!
13110,357,Thank you!! Wonderful place and great host
13111,357,It was nice space but the heat was off n it was cold almost all night other then that it was good.
13112,357,Great place! Can’t wait to stay again
13113,357,Had a great stay! Perfect for the night
13114,357,The tiny hut was amazing for our quick weekend trip. We loved our time there.
13115,357,Love this place! Thank you !!
13116,358,"Awesome host, makes u feel right at home, everything met my expectations 🤙🏾will definitely be back and definitely recommend 🌴"
13117,358,"Maria and her huband are most gracious hosts. They make you feel more like family than a guest in their home. If you enjoy Cuban food, you are in for a treat
I will definitely be back and recommend their hospitable country setting to other friends."
13118,358,"Maria made our stay special with her Cuban coffee, cafe con leche and amazing consideration of my food sensitivities with a great breakfast spread!"
13119,358,"Great host!! Maria is very attentive and treats you like family. The Cuban coffee she makes is home made, it’s awesome!! Her home is warm and inviting. I look forward to staying at her home again. She serves a continental breakfast and great conversation."
13120,358,"spacious room with comfortable bed, fridge, and separate entrance. nice rural, peaceful setting. great location just off of 73/74. warm hospitality from a caring hostess. heating unit in the room so you can set the temperature as desired."
13121,358,"Maria’s place is on a farm away from the bustle, and it is peaceful and beautiful. It has a pretty view of a peach farm on one side, and her dogs running around freely in the mornings is the perfect picture. Maria’s place was just as described- clean, organized, and with everything that you need for a stay. Maria is very clean and organized, and present when you need her, and as a solo female traveling/ staying for 4 weeks in a new city for the first time, I felt very safe at Maria’s place.
The room itself was clean, with a comfortable bed and clean sheets, clean towels, a large desk and chair, a closet, a tv, mirror, AC/heat, just as indicated. If I needed anything (extension cord etc), Maria and her husband Armando went out of their way to make sure I had it as fast as possible. On days, and with my permission, Maria also vacuumed the room and kept it clean. The kitchen is shared, but equipped with everything you need: an oven, stove, all the utensils etc. The bathroom was clean and sanitized throughout my stay. I also had multiple packages shipped to Maria’s and had no trouble with any of that. Maria was there to meet me on day 1 and made herself available anytime I needed her. She went above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable and taken care of, and was friendly, communicative, and very helpful. And not to forget the famous Cuban coffee you will be offered when you first meet her- she takes a lot of pride in making it for you and it is delicious.
And the people themselves- Maria, and on occasion, her husband Armando- are absolutely lovely people. They are kind and generous, and truly like the grandparents you never had. They took such good care of me and would check to make sure I was safe on my drives to and from work. On days, they had food cooked and would check with me to see if I wanted to join them for meals. Maria also has fresh farm eggs on hand and let me help myself to them each morning. And on a lot of days, Maria was just there, waiting at the door, being the cheerful face you needed to come home to after a long day’s work. Maria, her husband, and their two wonderful (and friendly) dogs were my family for a month, and they treated me like part of it. If you have any chance of staying here, you should definitely consider it. At the end of it, you’ll leave rejuvenated, and having supported a place run by the nicest people. And overall, as you can tell, I 100% recommend this stay."
13122,358,"Great host. 25 minutes from town and in the neighborhood of many peach orchards. if you want privacy and quite country living this is it. Maria is a wonderful host. Pleasant, cheerful and just a very nice person to be around"
13123,358,"Maria is so much more than a wonderful host, she is warm and kind and genuinely cares to make you feel at home. She is an amazing cook and a great listener. She made me feel welcome and wanted and even prepared meals around my dietary restrictions. I was thrilled to find an amazing host that I will always stay with whenever I have the chance but most of all, to meet such a fascinating person who I am honored to call my friend"
13124,358,Staying at Maria’s was a great experience and I would 10/10 recommend. She is an amazing person and a fantastic cook. I am a student and stayed for 8 weeks and she made me feel right at home. She treated me like her own granddaughter and took great care of me. Everything is very clean and she provides a breakfast for her guests. She makes delicious Cuban coffee and other authentic Cuban meals. She loves meeting new people and you will have great conversations with her. If you are in the area or anywhere nearby you should definitely stay at Maria’s.
13125,358,"Maria is a fabulous host! There was not a moment we weren’t impressed about her efforts to please her guests. She responded quickly to our request, supplied a personal cell number if we needed to get ahold of her, as well as a key to enter a private entrance on the right side of the house.

Each morning we were served a delicious breakfast personally accompanied by a cup of Cuban Coffee. If you aren’t in the mood for contact she has quick breakfast items set up on the table.

She is a very interesting woman! Expect a conversation on some of the cultural history behind the food she prepares and a little about her side cooking business.

The bedroom is fantastic for the price point! She goes out of her way to provide a personal touch far exceeding what you might find in a $100+ Airbnb or hotel experience. The King size bed was spacious and comfortable. There is a stand alone air conditioning unit that kept us very cool during our stay.

The large Roku TV stands on the wall in front of the bed with a fireplace beneath creating a relaxing homely atmosphere. The TV has a number of channels: Netflix, Amazon Prime, HBO Max, among others.

The entire house is kept exceptionally clean for your stay. It is clear she takes pride in her home and her customers that come through. The living room area is open to use and also has a TV. She has a small speaker near her that she plays relaxing Latin Jazz on! I thoroughly enjoyed the efforts she placed on making sure we were comfortable with her playing the music beforehand.

The bathroom has a jacuzzi style jet system built in and soap dispensers on the wall if you didn’t bring anything yourself. On request she had a heating unit to keep the bathroom warm if it was too chilly, but we didn’t have to use it during our stay.

My girlfriend and I both were given the chance to spend time with her and her 2 lovely dogs that she keeps in the front bedroom near the kitchen. She is such a pleasant woman to talk to and even extended an offer to swing by again for a BBQ with her and her children.


I highly recommend this Host to anyone reviewing their options for the Ellerbe or Rockingham area. Out of the many stays we have had in the North Carolina area, she is our top Host so far!"
13126,358,Maria was an awesome host. Definitely will be staying again.
13127,358,Very nice cozy place. The room is very spacious and has its own TV and fridge. Definitely would recommend.
13128,358,Had a great time talking with Maria! She even had something special in our room when we arrived bc I had mentioned it was my daughter’s birthday before arriving! Very good Cuban coffee! Great person and hospitality! 💜
13129,358,Out in the country but close enough to the highway to make it convenient for travelers. We stayed 3 nights to go off-roading in Uwharrie National Forest on The OHV trails. Maria is a wonderful host. Making you feel very welcome and part of her family.
13130,358,Amazing genuine hospitality. Best Coffee Ever. As close to home as you can get.
13131,358,Maria’s place is a fantastic place to get away and reconnect with a loved one. It is truly a rustic farm house with a more than comfortable room. Maria I can say will truly become a good friend of yours so gracious and a joy to talk to.
13132,358,"Amazing comfy stay, sweet host, very considerate, very good coffee, great price, great communication :) You will love the Host, I promise. :)"
13133,358,This place has the comfiest bed!! I enjoyed Maria's Cuban cooking and our lively conversations. She and her husband are good people.
13134,358,"It's like I have a new Grandma! She really made me feel at home. Maria was so wonderful and kind. She went out of her way to accomodate me and my partner. I told her that my partner had a cold, and when we got there, she had made Cuban Chicken Soup for us. Words cannot express the relief and gratitude I felt upon arriving at her place. She also makes the best Cuban Coffee in the world!!!!! This was such a good experience. I feel like my AirBnB adventures peaked at my stay with her. Thank you so much!"
13135,358,It was wonderful meeting Maria and her husband. They were very kind and hospitable. It felt more like we were staying with family then at a random house. Very comfortable accommodation.
13136,358,The king bed was wonderful.
13137,368,"Lilian’s Airbnb is 100% perfect in every aspect: the room spacious, the view idyllic, everything was spotless, completely neat and clean.

Highly recommended.

Best greetings, José."
13138,368,"Lillian was an excellent host! She initiated communication right away, providing clear directions to the location and letting me know what to expect. She welcomed me when I arrived and made sure I had everything needed. I enjoyed the coziness of the room, which was nicely decorated and outfitted with everything needed and more! I also appreciated the local restaurant recommendations she provided and enjoyed stopping by one of the listed coffee shops on my way out in the morning. Lillian provided a very comfortable stay, and this spot is definitely worth a repeat visit!"
13139,368,Lillian was simply wonderful. She was pleasant and went above and beyond to make my stay relaxing and stress free. I will definitely return!
13140,368,"Lillian greeted me with her little dog Cooper a few minutes after I arrived. The room exceeded my expectations. It was decorated so nicely and absolutely spotless! I attended a class at Campbell Folk School the week I stayed with Lillian. It was a short drive to the school and so nice to come back to the beautiful, peaceful surroundings after a long day of fun at The Folk School. I missed my dog so it was also nice to be greeted by Cooper in the afternoons too. :) I would highly recommend Lillian’s place. It was absolutely perfect - I wouldn’t change a thing. Thank you SO much Lillian and Cooper!"
13141,368,Lillian's place made me feel right at home. She was so pleasant and friendly. The place had a nice view of the mountains. I will return soon and stay again. I loved the place and it's energy ❤️❤️❤️ Thanks Mrs. Lillian and Cooper.
13142,368,"Lillian has a beautiful and secluded place. Super friendly and very keen on all the details that make for a very comfortable stay. If we are ever in this part of the country again, we will try and stay here again."
13143,368,"A perfect respite away from life’s busy-ness! Lillian’s beautiful suite was exactly what I was looking for - a fabulous getaway but close enough to “civilization” to run out and grab dinner at a moment’s notice. Lillian is a fabulous hostess; the directions were very well marked, the suite was spotlessly clean and had every amenity you might need. Super soft sheets and a great shower were perfect after a long day in the cold! I can’t say enough about the place — just book it!"
13144,368,"Lillian is one of those hosts that has every “t” crossed and “i “ dotted. Literally every step of your stay from booking to check out is scripted perfectly for you and your convenience. One can easily tell that she’s a veteran host and is sensitive to a guest needs while providing a tremendous level of service and support. Whether you’re staying one night or an extended stay, I guarantee, Lillian will do everything in her power to make your stay fabulous!"
13145,368,Wonderful place to stay. It was small but just what we needed since we weren’t there until the evening. Lillian was a wonderful hostess.
13146,368,"Beautiful stay with an attentive host. Lillian had everything covered. The Dragonfly room was clean, well thought out, and comfortable. Thanks Lillian!"
13147,368,"Beautiful view, cute room and wonderful host"
13148,368,"Lillian is amazing she fit me in on such short notice and the price is amazing, nice rooms, comfy bed, highly recommend!!!

Will definitely be back"
13149,368,"The drive in was an adventure of its own, but Lillian's signs made it super easy to get to her place!! the two beds were clean and comfortable, and all the layers of sheets and comforters made it sooo much better to snuggle up in since we left the windows open to enjoy to cooler temps and the surrounding nature! we were greeted by the infamous Cooper in the morning as we were packing things up and he was the sweetest and goodest boy who loved his scratches!! Lillian has given so much thought and care into everything in the room to make sure that anyone who stays has everything the would need, and then some!! we got to chat with Lillian in the morning before we left and she was the sweetest! we got to hear a little about all the adventures she has been on throughout life and it encouraged us as we continued onto our adventure! we would highly recommend staying with Lillian even if it is just for a night!"
13150,368,Great hospitality. Exactly what I was looking for. I’ll be back
13151,368,Wonderful place and comfortable for two people. The view from outside is so calming. Lilian is very sweet and her dog as well.
13152,368,"Super clean and home-y, peaceful, wonderful view and deck, lots of little things to make the stay convenient. Lillian was super friendly and available for anything I needed. The directions for driving and check in were clear and simple. Cooper the doggy is also the cutest friendliest little guy you'll meet!"
13153,368,Amazing place to stay.
13154,368,Great place to stay! Lillian is very nice and accommodating! Would highly recommend her place when in the area. Follow her driving instructions to her spot and look out for the signs to guide you to her place
13155,368,We loved all the thoughtful touches of this airbnb!
13156,368,"warmth and hospitality as always, plus a gorgeous autumn"
13157,368,"The ""Dragonfly"" room was very homey, clean, and nicely outfitted! A nice breakfast nook with a coffee pot, a small fridge, and a toaster oven, and a small table. The bathroom is a bit small but the clean and perfect working shower (my favorite) made up the difference! The house is very private and quiet and Lillian is always available. My Garmin GPS worked perfectly and the directions are accurate and clearly marked with yellow arrows and quilt signs at every turn, would however suggest arriving before dark if at all possible. I hope to return!"
13158,368,enjoyed our stay.
13159,368,"If you want a beautiful and peaceful location
This is perfect
Lillian is the perfect host
Best stay we’ve had on our whole road trip

P and J from UK"
13160,368,Great location; road in is very well marked; Lillian was so nice and even provided us with a clothes line when we mentioned we'd be showing up with wet clothes from rafting on the Ocoee. Definitely recommend.
13161,368,"You will love this place, so peaceful in the woods. I wish we would have had time to enjoy the fire pit, it looked inviting."
13162,368,Lillian’s place has all you need to have a relaxing and quiet stay.
13163,368,"Excellent host. The nice clean space is exactly as described with a lot of extras coffee, tea, popcorn, paper towels, forks, knives, soaps, and shampoo. A good place to relax and refresh."
13164,368,"Loved staying at Lillian’s house. I travel to Brasstown to do the Fall Festival at John C. Campbell Folk School. At the end of the day, I need a quiet and relaxing place. The Dragonfly suite is great. Highly recommend."
13165,368,"Fantastic , peaceful place .Great location. Charming host .We loved it staying with Lillian !"
13166,368,Amazing host!!! Very beautiful setting. We will be visiting her again soon!!
13167,368,always a joy
13168,368,"Great stay, Lilian was a wonderful host! Would stay again if traveling near here again."
13169,368,always a pleasure
13170,368,"Lillian's place is great. Everything is super clean, you have your own private little corner in the house, it's in the middle of the woods but a Walmart for groceries is nearby. You can have your own barbecue and Lillian and the dog are just super sweet :)"
13171,368,Very nice room. Enjoyed Cooper!
13172,368,always a pleasure
13173,368,wonderful
13174,368,great as always--Cooper the rescue dog even escorted me on a 2 mile walk through the hills
13175,368,Great space & WONDERFUL hosting. Will put this on my list of places in the area.
13176,368,great stay as usual!
13177,368,"Love the place! The host was hospitable, the room was well decorated. Great to check stars in the nights."
13178,368,"Great spot, great host. Lillian and Cooper, “the welcoming dog” is are amazing. Nice people like this are getting harder and harder to find. Place was exactly as described. Highly recommend this place."
13179,368,Comfy. Cozy. Can't say enough good things 🙂
13180,368,"Great place to stay. Nice and private. At night, you are surrounded by the sounds of nature from the woods. This is a great getaway location."
13181,368,I loved staying here- the host was so kind and the place was lovely! Would stay again in a heartbeat.
13182,368,Lillian is an amazing host. She went above and beyond to make my stay wonderful. The communication was excellent and the room beautiful! Cooper is adorable
13183,368,"Lillian is the bomb!!

This Airbnb is the best bang for your buck if you’re traveling with a friend. Her instructions are clear and concise on how to get in and out of the building and up through the driveway.

If you’re traveling on a budget, this is the place to be!"
13184,368,We wanted to be back there the moment we left. Absolutely stunning and peaceful. Loved every minute in this thoughtful cozy space.
13185,368,Lovely place and a great value if you just need a place to relax at the end of the day. Set in the beautiful North Carolina hills. Cant beat the view!
13186,368,"Lillian’s place is great! Clean and quiet with a nice view. Her dog, cooper, was also very sweet. I only stayed two nights but wish I’d booked longer. The drive is a little precarious but not too bad- I was just fine in my Civic."
13187,368,"Beautifully decorated, clean and well-maintained room in a lovely home set in a picturesque location. Not much more needs said. Don't hesitate to book this place if you are in the area. It was one of the nicest places I've ever stayed at. Would stay again without hesitation."
13188,368,expect a well kept home with great conversations!
13189,368,Return visitor and enjoyed it just as much this time. Gorgeous setting and has everything we needed. Great having Cooper greet us each evening when we returned. We’ll be back.
13190,368,"If you like a quiet place in the mountains, then this is the spot. I stayed in the ""Dragonfly"" room with access to the south-facing deck. The room size perfectly fits one person with the single bed. And since I traveled alone, there was no argument about leaving the door and window open all night long. There is a sliding screen door that can be used to keep insects out when the door is left open. The (almost) full moon on the two nights I stayed gave a wonderful light into the room. Just lovely. The room was clean, neat, and had everything I needed: Coffee maker with coffee/mugs/creamer, a refrigerator. Maybe a toaster oven and microwave - but I didn't use them if they were there. Great place for quiet solitude! Getting there requires a car. Getting there by touring bike would be a challenge (for me anyway) due to the hills on the driveway which is about 1/2 paved and 1/2 gravel for about 1/2 mile in length. Such a nice place - I will return!"
13191,368,"This was an absolutely beautiful place in the woods. The room was nicely set-up and has access to a nice porch. The private bathroom was clean and convenient. Just make sure you use the provided directions, because google struggled a little. I will definitely stay here again if I'm in the area."
13192,368,"Great place, very clean. Great for one person staying at the Folk School - which is 15 minutes away. Nice and quiet, and the coffee service was much appreciated.
The last quarter mile is a gravel road that is pretty hilly - not for low clearance sports cars.:)"
13193,368,"This space is ideal for a quiet escape to nature. I enjoyed coffee on the porch each morning of my stay. Breakfast was easy to prepare with the toaster, microwave, minifridge, cutlery and dishes provided. Spacious shower with hot water, and a skylight in the bathroom! Multiple outlets (& USB ports & WiFi). Comfortable bed - it was so nice to sleep with the window open.
Lillian was a top-notch hostess! She covered all the bases upon check in and was available if I needed her. Also LOVED Cooper, the puppy welcome committee. 🐶🐾"
13194,368,Very nice place
13195,368,"Beautiful location, comfortable accommodations, and Lillian the host was great! I enjoyed my stay for a motorcycle trip to Tail of the Dragon, and would recommend for a single or couple looking for a nice getaway spot."
13196,368,Lillian has a wonderful place to stay with everything a person needs. The property is quite and very peaceful. Lillian made sure when I arrived to show me everything that I needed to know. Her pet Mr. cooper loves to greet you and check on you every day for his daily petting. If you want a place that is quite and peaceful to relax this is the place. Close to Murphy and Andrews if you need something or dinning. Just remember if you stay there check her map out on the wall and place a pin 📌 in the area you are from. There is people from all over the country and the world that have stayed there. Great experience!!
13197,368,"Beautiful small room tucked away in the southern Appalachian hills. Great access to local mountains for some scenic drives and local reservoirs for water based activities. Very friendly host and a cozy room to relax, read and recoup!"
13198,368,"She is simply the best! Clean room, all necessary amenities."
13199,368,Great place. Fantastic location for my needs. Host is very helpful Definitely stay there again
13200,368,"Lillian's hospitality is par excellence! I enjoyed the beautiful views, large deck right outside my door overlooking a forest, with a great BBQ, comfy large space and so clean. Thanks so much!"
13201,368,This room is wonderful for a long term stay. Thank you Lillian for the lovely space and thoughtful amenities!
13202,368,"Lillian is a charming hostess! The dragonfly bedroom was very comfortable for one person, with everything I needed: Bed, sitting area, refrigerator, silverware, nice bathroom with lovely shower/tub. The setting is deliciously dark and quiet at night, and I slept very well. The only slightly downside is the narrow road with a gravel section which is quite steep. I simply drove slowly and all was well."
13203,368,We enjoyed our stay at the Sunflower room. It was a great use of space and had lots of homey touches. The signage and directions to the house were great. Cooper the dog was too sweet.
13204,368,"This is one of the best places I have stayed at through Airbnb. It an en suite bedroom with private entrance. An entertainment center is cleverly converted into a kitchenette with microwave refrigerator dishes etc. The setting is private beautiful quiet. you'll have to drive a bit to go out to find food to eat, so bring something in or arrive at the b&b after you've had your meal. friendly, loving dog on the premises. and the value is unbelievable. I have stayed in lots of really terrible motels at 2 and 1/2 times the price."
13205,368,great place! clean and professionally done. very nice host. private and quiet. had a great time
13206,368,"This is a very relaxing and serene setting in the woods. If you are older like us, opt for the apartment at this air b&b. It is much larger and has a queen bed.
Lillian is a very good host and everything was really clean and all your needs will be met. An added bonus is her dog Cooper who is very well mannered and such a sweet dog that visits when you are on the deck enjoying nature."
13207,368,"Great 2 week stay, Lillian is a wonderful person who makes all feel very welcome and comfortable in her home. She was very helpful and giving, laundry, extra comforter, heater. etc... The space is more setup for a single but we, as a couple, did just fine. Very clean, nice amenities, bathroom, and a great deck to chill. Her dog, Cooper, is the most loveable thing ever. Seriously thought about stealing him ;)"
13208,368,Looking to get away from it all? This is the place. Somewhat remote and very quiet. Lillian is a conscious host. As this is a single bed it makes it a one person stay. I wish I could have enjoyed the deck more but it was rainy the two nights I was there. If I am ever back in the area I will stay there again.
13209,368,"This place is beautiful! Don’t hesitate to book it. The bed was very comfortable, lovely decor, and the most peaceful spot surrounded by nature. Everything you might need in a tiny kitchen area..and your own private bath. Lillian is a wonderful host. Ten stars!"
13210,368,"Staying here was so so nice! After a night of tent camping, I was thrilled to have a comfortable bed and warm shower and beautiful deck to sit out on. Lillian and her dog were so sweet. I didn’t expect there to be so many kitchen basics (plates, silverware, coffee grounds WITH sugar and creamer, microwave, and toaster oven with potholder). The wooden furniture and green mugs were adorable, and I now I feel like I need to upgrade my own home decor, ha! But yes, I definitely recommend staying here if you want a nice, quiet stay. The drive to get there was a bit rough, but nothing a careful driver couldn’t get through."
13211,368,We definitely recommend this location and will be back. The accommodations were great in a picturesque setting. Lillian was a wonderful host.
13212,368,"Lillian’s place is clean, quiet and close to town. Has everything necessary for a comfortable stay. The gravel road is well-maintained and was not a problem to drive on with my Ford Focus. This is my second stay here and will stay again!"
13213,368,It was very nice meeting Lilliam! I've never dreamed to know a such beautiful and magical place. Everything was more than perfect! 🌻🌻🌻🌻🌷⚘😀
13214,368,Best to arrive before dark because of the road in. The neighborhood does not have street lights. Lillian and Cooper are most welcoming and helpful.
13215,368,"Lillian is a very organized and thoughtful host. It’s a bit hard to find… and a bit precarious if you are on a motorcycle. The room is very clean, the a/c wonderful. All is good!"
13216,368,"Lillian is a great host. Her place is very clean and nice, in the middle of a very calm and scenic natural environment. The place is a little tricky to find using Google maps so be sure to follow the instructions carefully. It's easy to get lost in the hills. Overall great place to stay and relax."
13217,368,Close by to several small towns and outdoor areas like trails and forests. But also located out of the way from traffic and people if you’re looking for more solitude.
13218,368,"My son and I stayed in the Dragonfly room for two weeks while he worked on a local farm. Everything was easy, comfortable, and super relaxing. Cooper, the dog, greeted us as we arrived and Lillian was an excellent hostess."
13219,368,"Beautiful location, Clean bnb. Peaceful, quiet area. Lilian is a great host!"
13220,368,"Lillian was a fantastic host. Welcoming and warm. Her place is even nicer and cozier in person. So clean, comfortable and had everything I needed. The view from the porch was incredibly lovely. Would absolutely recommend and would stay here again."
13221,368,Lillian is a great host! The room is very nice and amenities are great! Lots of little touches! Location is peaceful and beautiful to look at and just relax on the deck! Plenty of privacy from others but if you get a chance to meet her little doggy he is very nice and loves some attention!
13222,368,I enjoyed my stay here so much. I will certainly be back for another refreshing getaway. Lillian is a great host and her dog is super cool!
13223,368,"Quiet, mountain retreat. Simple, yet everything you need. Relaxing on the deck overlooking the treetops is always very soothing."
13224,368,"Great host, and nice place to stay at a very affordable cost."
13225,368,"My commute here was very stressful so I arrived later than expected. Lillian and her dogs, Cooper and Charlie, put me at ease with a warm welcome. The room is on a second floor deck in a heavily wooded area sprinkled with native dogwood that makes it seem as if you are in a treehouse. It’s been a long time since I enjoyed the enchanting sound of trees whispering in the wind. Each night a hoot owl sang me to sleep. The room is thoughtfully furnished and includes a small refrigerator, toaster oven, microwave, and coffee maker. Lillian and I had time to chat; she is so charming. I hope to return to this refuge in the trees."
13226,368,"I arrived at Lillian's Airbnb full of stress from a busy work week and within a couple of hours I could already feel myself decompressing! The view from the deck is so lovely and inviting, and the sounds of nature allowed peace and relaxation to settle in. Not only was I welcomed by Lillian with a friendly smile and demeanor, but I was also greeted by her sweet dog, Cooper, as I pulled into the drive!

The room was clean and quiet, well equipped with all the essentials. Lillian was available for any questions, etc, but was also very respectful of my space and time.

I would highly recommend her place for anyone who wants/needs some time to get away and recharge their batteries. In fact, I have already booked another weekend stay at her place!"
13227,368,Excellent !
13228,369,"Really sweet and simple space that’s probably underpriced. Carmen is so nice and the place was quiet, which was what I wanted/needed after a couple of long workdays. Would definitely stay again!"
13229,369,"Absolutely beautiful! Such a cozy place to stay. Carmen and her husband were so nice and helpful! We stayed for a week and it was so nice, definitely recommend to anyone!"
13230,369,"Got in late and left early in the morning, but Carmen and her husband were very accommodating, bed was comfy, bathroom was clean. Everything I was looking for."
13231,369,"Excellent experience. Carmen and Stuart were extremely welcoming and helpful during my stay. I had my bass boat with me that they let me park and charge in the drive way, and Stuart even was nice enough to help me do some maintenance on the boat during my stay. 10/10"
13232,369,I can’t begin to say how nice and welcoming they are. I loved everything about my stay with them. They are a very sweet family who was very welcoming. I would recommend them 1000% I moved to the area and my stay with them was to learn the area and they gave me so much great information and advice. Loved the experience stay there.
13233,369,"Lovely people and great hosts. Beautiful, clean home in a great location. Thank you so much for being welcoming."
13234,369,"I had a very pleasant stay at Carmen’s place. Highly recommend this place, especially if you are a cat person!"
13235,369,Wonderful and friendly hosts. They make you feel at home. I enjoyed my stay very much.
13236,369,This is the place you want to stay
13237,369,Great host and a very comfortable stay. We would stay here again!
13238,369,Wonderful people. Great stay. Even invited me to a steak dinner!
13239,369,"During my residency I spent a year in Carmen’s home. Carmen and her husband Stewart are very friendly and treat you like family. Their home is clean and quiet. They have 2 cats that are super friendly and love attention. The pool is a great bonus. There are plenty of nearby restaurants in Mooresville and it’s close to the lake. If you’re looking for a long term stay I would recommend staying here. I made life long friends, thank you Carmen!"
13240,369,Second time of possibly many times I may stay here. Carmen's place works well for me because I drive up north to avoid heat in Florida and don't like side of the road hotels. Wish Carmen actually worked for Airbnb because Airbnb customer service in regard to another host is terrible in fact if hosts worked for Airbnb the standards for other hosts would be so much higher. Carmen in a genuinely nice person and treated me like gold.
13241,369,Great price for the stay!
13242,369,Great hospitality. Super comfy bed. Hyper-clean
13243,369,Awesome place for the money and really comfortable bed
13244,369,"Great spot! A cute room, private bathroom, and in my opinion - the comfiest pillows! Carmen and Stewart are great hosts!"
13245,369,"Best stay ever! Not only is this a great location with everything you need, the hosts are incredibly gracious. It was very easy to find, the instructions were clear, no issues checking in and getting in/out of the house. Plenty of complimentary snacks and coffee. The friendly cats are a bonus as well as the pool and HOT TUB. The room is very clean and spacious, the mattress is exactly what you need for a good nights sleep. Also the bathroom you get to yourself is really big. Overall, a super stay."
13246,369,Carmen is great and very attentive. Enjoyed my stay!
13247,369,The cats are very sweet and quiet. We plan to stay again when we're in the area! The bed is comfortable and clean bathroom. Surpassed our expectations :)
13248,369,Everything was just as described in the ad. The space was clean and organized. The hosts were great! Communicated everything super well!
13249,369,"This was a very comfortable stay with thoughtful touches. The location is convenient...close to everything, yet in a beautiful, quiet neighborhood."
13250,369,"What a great deal! If you are just looking for a place to sleep this is perfect. Your own bathroom, nice room and bed, and great communication."
13251,369,Booked for my son who is attending Pit Weld U. He had nothing but good things to say.
13252,369,"Carmen’s place was great! Nice, private corner of the house with spacious, comfy room and bathroom. Carmen was very friendly and responsive, and their cats were nice, too!"
13253,369,My son is attending Weld U nearby and this was the perfect place for him to stay. Everything he needed was nearby. Carmen was very responsive to our text.
13254,369,"This was one of the best Air bnb experiences I’ve ever had. Carmen and Stewart did a great job at making me feel comfortable.Plus a delicious steak dinner to end my one-night stay!
Clean, cozy, and affordable. I would definitely recommend this one!"
13255,369,"Amazing place to stay! Carmen and Stewart are kind and extremely hospitable hosts! Great location!
Cats are wonderful ☺️
You should definitely ask to see them! 100% worths it!"
13256,369,Such great people! Made everything so easy and stress free. Very clean and nice. I would definitely try to book this stay again.
13257,369,This is a wonderful stay! I recommend it to anyone visit the Charlotte area!
13258,369,Carmen's place is great! The energy in their home is positive and comfortable. The room and bathroom were very clean. I am very satisfied with my stay and would definitely stay again in the future.
13259,369,"Guest room and private full bath at end of upstairs hallway, so you are deep within the house with people home. Plenty of space in room and counter in bathroom for belongings. Comfy firm bed and super soft pillows with extra blanket."
13260,369,"Great people, Carmen and her husband are very accommodating and will make you feel welcome!"
13261,369,Hospitality was great and location worked well for me. Place was quiet and comfortable for working remotely.
13262,369,"Amazing place with amazing people. On the nicer side of mooresville convenient to everything, shopping, dining, 77."
13263,369,Great people and very genuine. They truly want you to feel comfortable during your stay at their home.
13264,369,"Carmen is super warm and welcoming. I met interesting people and had great conversation that made me feel like I'd known everyone for much longer, and the town much better. This type of stay is what I miss about traveling, and why I prefer AirBnb over any other way to travel. I did not have much time, but the time I did have was enriched by staying with Carmen. I got a clean, comfy bed and a few memories. I would hang out with Carmen and anyone she has in her orbit anytime, and would happily stay with her again."
13265,369,100% the best hosts I’ve ever had. I wish I could give them a 10/5 star review. It was the first time I’ve stayed somewhere that the hosts live in as well. The hosts were extremely accommodating and even parked on the side of their yard all so I could keep the boat I was traveling with closer to the house/garage. I was more than welcome to join them for meals or use anything in the kitchen and had great recommendations for anything I wanted to do and anywhere I wanted to go. They are just great human beings on top being great hosts. Sir the “catdog” was just as awesome and friendly too. Everything was extremely clean when I arrived and throughout the entire stay.
13266,369,Amazing location and pool! I loved it here and enjoyed how nice they were. A truly magical place.
13267,369,"I loved staying with Carmen and would absolutely stay again! She was so warm and welcoming. This was my first time staying in someone's home that they currently live in, so I thought it would be a bit weird and awkward but that was definitely not the case!
Check-in was a breeze, and there were coffee and snacks always available. Everything was clean, and the bed was quite comfortable. Beautiful yard and patio as well. And as many other reviews have stated, Sir the cat was just as warm and welcoming! Super friendly and greeted me at the door.
Bottom line, you can't go wrong staying here!"
13268,369,"I made this reservation for my son Jason. Here is he wants to say after his stay：Carmen's house is a very comfortable place with all the essentials. Room and bathroom are very clean. They have a beautiful garden and swimming pool. Carmen and Stewart are very kind and made me feel like I was at home. I truly enjoyed this private and quiet location, and will stay with them if I come back to Mooresville in the future."
13269,369,Fantastic home and couple!
13270,369,"I could not have had a better first time Airbnb experience. Especially in the midst of this Covid 19. Carmen and Stewart are warm, friendly, generous and respect your privacy. Beautiful peaceful location. And Sir the cat is super friendly. I would without hesitation stay with them again!"
13271,369,"Nice place, good hosts!"
13272,369,Carmen is a lovely host; space is quite comfy; friendliest cat I've ever met; highly recommend
13273,369,"Carmen and Stewart were absolutely fantastic! Large and spacious home. Wonderful bedroom with private bath. I loved it! Extra amenities like coffee, granola bars were great! My best experience as a guest so far!"
13274,369,If you want a great experience - this is it!
13275,369,"Carmen and Stewart are great hosts! This was my first Airbnb experience - I booked for a month while apartment hunting due to relocating from the midwest. Ended up extending for an additional week.
They thought of just about everything you might need and if there's anything else, just ask.
They will let you go about your business but if they are home when you are, you can choose to have a great conversation. If asked, they'll share more about the area but they'll stay out of your business if that's preferred. I stayed Nov-Dec 2019 but I imagine summer at their home would be even better with that beautiful pool and hot tub. If you like to play golf, they are on a golf course. And just a little walk from Lake Norman."
13276,369,"Already submitted review for my extended stay so I'll just ""second"" that. Great Hosts!"
13277,369,Very comfortable and accommodating stay. Great and comfortable rooms and the price is outstanding. Couldn’t imagine an easier AIRBNB stay.
13278,369,"Great place to stay, and plenty of privacy if wanted!"
13279,369,"This is an awesome place! Carmen and Stewart are really kind people and very easy to reach out to. They have a pet cat named Sir who is probably the friendliest cat you'll ever meet. The space is very clean. The area the house is in is very tranquil and beautiful. Important amenities for daily living like grocery stores are just a 5 minute drive away. If I had to stay in Mooresville again, I will definitely stay in this home."
13280,369,"I had a great time, the house was very comfortable, i felt right at home."
13281,369,"I was only able to stay one night but Carmen and Stuart are so warm and welcoming, you come as a visitor and leave as a friend. The bedroom and bath were clean and private. The bed was comfy and the pool and hottub were very nice! Sir, the cat, is as sweet as can be and their home is a short distance to great restaurants and shopping. I definitely recommend Carmen's home. Thank you for a lovely stay Carmen!"
13282,369,Beautiful place. Nice quiet area. I appreciated having the privacy and my own bathroom! Thanks Carmen!
13283,369,Another excellent stay with Carmen (and Sir... a very charming and chatty kitty). Carmen had everything ready for me when I arrived and I had a very comfortable and relaxing visit. I highly recommend Carmen's home to other potential guests.
13284,369,This was one of the best Airbnb stays that I have ever had. I was very impressed with how thoughtfully laid out everything was. I would definitely stay here again in the future.
13285,369,Carmen is a wonderful host. She has a beautiful home in a very nice quiet neighborhood. I always enjoy staying there.
13286,369,"Carmen was an excellent host and her home was very spacious and charming. I had the opportunity to get to know Carmen a bit during my stay and enjoyed our conversations. Carmen's cat, Sir, is quite the communicator as well, and you can always count on him to welcome you upon your arrival. I look forward to staying with Carmen (and Sir) again in the future."
13287,369,Carmen has a lovely home . She is a gracious host and I look forward to my next stay
13288,369,Excellent stay!!!!
13289,369,"This was a most enjoyable experience. Excellent host who really make you feel at home. They have the most adorable cat ever cat who really warmed my heart and will be thoroughly missed. He basically hung out with me to keep me company at all times. He loves to chat often and is just a ham! I appreciate the hot Latte and all the goodies on the counter. The area is just cute and perfect! I suggest Tony's pizza. You will love the Jersey style (huge) slices and go with the daily special. Amazing! The bed is very comfy and you have your own bathroom. BUT the best part of my stay was the ambience and the Christmas display inside. Reminded me of Grove Park Inn. Just beautiful! And Carmen has the cleanest place, very organized too! Best Airbnb and great value."
13290,369,They have made me feel so at home! This place has definitely been my home away from home for the past 4 months. Wonderful people!
13291,369,"Carmen was a great host! Great neighborhood, really clean and nice, and she was super helpful. Would definitely stay with her again."
13292,369,Beautiful house & beautiful people. I will definitely stay there again when I'm back in Mooresville.
13293,369,"This place is delightful! Situated in a quiet community with nice view out the window. The picture listed must be outdated, as the room I was in was tastefully appointed and very comfortable. The bed is exquisite! The bath next to the room is private. And the Kurrig coffee in the morning was perfect!
I didn't meet Carmen, but her husband was very welcoming! this home is a treasure!"
13294,369,"Carmen and her family are warm , soothing hosts. Timely contacts, updated whereabouts for my check-in were appreciated. The pool was perfect at the end of a long drive. But the tips on local restaurants were delightful and just right.
I felt at home at their house and all about while I stayed here.
Roger"
13295,369,Have stayed with Carmen and Stuart a couple times now - they've been incredibly welcoming and hospitable both times. Can't recommend them enough!
13296,369,"Very nice place to stay, Carmen is helpful and friendly!!!"
13297,369,"Carmen's house is located in a quiet and beautiful neighborhood on Lake Norman. Watch out for the ducks crossing the road leading to the house, though :-) Both the room and bathroom were large, clean and very comfortable. Carmen was helpful and flexible with the check-in and check-out process; she also let me store my road-bike in the garage for the night :-) Finally, there is a good selection of restaurants for breakfast, lunch and dinner about 5mn from the house, which makes the location perfect. I highly recommend Carmen's house for anyone looking to stay one or multiple nights in the area."
13298,369,Carmen and Stewart are fantastic hosts! I stayed with them for a month and was new to the area and they were especially welcoming and helpful. Couldn't recommend them more!
13299,369,I stayed at Carmen's place for three months and they always made me feel welcome in their home. They were very respectable of my privacy and I really enjoyed Sir the cat.
13300,369,"Excellent host- easy going, super inviting and hospitable. Room was clean and home access was painless. Without question I'd visit again!"
13301,369,Carmen and Stewart are fantastic people and immediately upon meeting them you feel as though they are friends you've had forever!
13302,369,Great place and family. Highly recommended.
13303,369,"Highly recommend this Airbnb, the hosts were wonderful, the home is beautiful."
13304,369,Very accommodating and comfortable. The best most comfortable bed I have slept in.
13305,369,Clean and friendly home with amenities and good location.
13306,369,Carmen and Stewart were great. It was like staying with family. Great experience.
13307,369,Carmen was such a kind and warm host! I felt so welcome and comfortable. I would be glad to stay again and again.
13308,369,It was very comfortable and I felt right at home. I really enjoyed meeting Stewart and Carmens's 94 year old mother Ophelia who was a delight. We had lots to talk about since she was born in Cuba and I will be going later in the year. Thank you again.
13309,369,"Pleasant place to stay. Good hosts, nice cat."
13310,369,Great place! The host really makes me feel like home. Recommend!
13311,369,"Carmen always goes above and beyond to accommodate and make travel life easy!!! She and Stewart are the sweetest couple and really
make you feel at home. I always try to stay here when my travelmbrings me back!!!"
13312,369,"Comfortable and quiet with a convenient location. Carmen was gracious and warm, and made me feel right at home."
13313,369,"We just hit it off like we'd known each other forever. Enjoyed dinner with Carmen and another former guest, where we had a deep discussion in which we solved all the problems of education in North Carolina. Loved all the animals, the house, the neighborhood (peace and quiet). Even the weather was halcyon. Bedroom has a really well-designed and outfitted closet. What's not to like? Just what I needed in my hectic life at this time."
13314,369,I was like I was visiting friends. The dogs and cat were a plus!
13315,369,Overall great! These folks are top notch and will definitely come back !!
13316,369,Carmen made time to welcome me in for the check in after I had to reschedule - she's a very friendly host with friendly pets in a beautiful neighborhood. Definitely recommend staying here.
13317,369,"These individuals are the kindest and most genuine that you will find - wow!!!

Carmen communicated about my arrival plans, met me at the door with southern hospitality, and invited me to ""make myself at home!""

Everything was as described and even more amazing! Coffee and snacks in the kitchen - privacy if you prefer it or conversation in the living room. They have long term stays for those working in the area which is just awesome - who wants to live in a hotel for a month? I wouldn't!

I'm even allergic to cats (I failed to read that portion prior to booking - my fault as it's listed) and Carmen ensured that she kept the cat with her and I did very well and didn't suffer from severe allergic reaction - I was so thankful!

I travel ALOT and I haven't had such an amazing experience -- you are missing out if you don't stay here!!!"
13318,369,"Delightful stay with Carmen and her husband. They were very flexible and accommodating. Enjoyed chatting with them also. The room was perfect with its own private bath, just as described. Beautiful neighborhood, too. Plan to stay with them again. Thank you so much!"
13319,369,Carmen and Stewart were great hosts. This was our second time staying with them and they were just as good as our first time. They were so nice and open and Stewart even came out to our event at the local racetrack. If I'm ever in the area wouldn't mind staying!
13320,369,Extremely friendly and sweet family. Maverick and Sir (the dog and cat) are a delight. Very welcoming and perfect for my trip purposes.
13321,369,"Hosts are very friendly, home is impecable, I love staying here!"
13322,369,"Carmen has a beautiful home, I cant recall a place I've been that was more welcoming. Truly a great place and a great host."
13323,369,"Carmen and Stewart made me feel like family.As a first time user of Airbnb ,my experience exceeded my expectations. Beautiful home ,great accommodations .5stars for this couple. If work takes me that way again,they will be on top of my list.
"
13324,369,Fantastic yet again.
13325,369,Excellent. Excellent. Excellent.
13326,397,Great location and it was an Amazing place stay.
13327,397,"Overall, we very much enjoyed our stay. There were a couple of negatives but a lot of positives about this property.

The negatives:

- the condo was very difficult to find. We found the community very easily, but once inside, it was very difficult to find the building. Apparently there's no building number on the front, so it's difficult to find it. But, Beth communicated very well with my husband and we were able to find it.
- there was no coffee maker or dining table. Beth messaged me to let me know that there had been some issues in the past with people stealing the Keurig coffee maker. She stated this was the reason why there is no coffee maker at the property. So, after driving all day and having a difficult time finding the property at night, we had to ride out to Target to purchase an inexpensive coffee maker. While I certainly understand not wanting to have an expensive coffee maker stolen, I do not understand why an inexpensive coffee maker can't be left at the property for the guests to use. There was also no dining table. There were only a couple of folding chairs. We did not cook any meals during our stay, so the lack of dining table was not an issue for us. However, we would like to stay there in the future and having a dining table would be nice if we decided to cook a meal while we were there.

-The bath towels were extremely small. They were a lot smaller than regular- sized towels. My husband and I are average-sized and the towels barely wrapped around us.

Positives:
-The property is very clean and well-maintained.
-The style of the condo is very upscale with the pretty granite countertops throughout
-There were plenty of pillows on the beds which I loved
-The bathrooms were both large and very clean.
-We really liked that there was a full size washer and dryer and detergent at the property. We were able to do a little laundry while we were there and clean all of our clothes before going home.
-The couch and chair in the living room were very comfortable.
- we really liked the large walk-in closet in the master bedroom. We were able to put all of our suitcases and belongings in there and not have them in the bedroom.
- the community was very quiet and private
- we really like the location of this condo. It was only 5 minutes from many of the places we wanted to see while we were there.

Overall, we really enjoyed our weekend stay in Charlotte. We would definitely rent this condo again."
13328,397,"Beth and Elle are amazing hosts. The apartment is located in a convenient location. It was immaculate and had just about everything we needed for our stay. They are quick to respond if there are any issues. Thankfully other than a slight hiccup at check in, there were none. We will definitely look them up when we come back to Charlotte."
13329,397,This was such a great place. The location is central to so many things that Charlotte has to offer. The apartment was immaculate and had just about everything you would need. Beth and Elle were so accommodating and quick to respond to any questions/concerns. We will definitely come back.
13330,397,Beth and Elle were very welcoming and sweet people. The space was great and super convenient. Would definitely recommend.
13331,397,"nice hosts, clean place, and comfy bed! beth wasnt there when i arrived but her family made sure i had everything i needed. now, i'm not sure about the ""triple luxury"" description lol, but it was a perfectly average home (which isnt a bad thing!) and a perfectly typical stay. i'd certainly come back!"
13332,397,"Beth and her family are awesome host. Very hospitable. I have enjoyed my stay with them, I would recommend them to anyone.

The room has got to be one of the best values in the area. It’s in a nice quiet neighborhood, in a convenient location."
13333,413,"perfect cozy cabin for Beach getaway. location is awesome in surf City, walking distance to Beach, restaurants, grocery store. upgraded kitchen and appliances was fantastic beds super comfortable. will definitely stay again, highly recommend it!"
13334,413,"Great location—many great places to eat nearby, super cute & cozy little house just a few yards from the beach with EVERYTHING you’d need. So nice I’ve stayed here twice."
13335,413,"Great place, great location and Amy is great. We have stayed a few times and our only complaint her places are not always available when we want to come down!"
13336,413,"Such a great stay at Sea Biscuit! Amazing location, walking distance to eat, beach, park for sunset, bridge walk, Everything!"
13337,413,"While we enjoyed our short stay at this cottage, there was one aspect that really threw us off guard. The $130 cleaning fee is excessive for the amount of cleaning and tasks that the host requires their guests to complete before the check out. This list is long upon first look and gives an intimidating vibe like, if you don't follow these rules, you will have to pay for it. I have stayed at many Airbnbs and had never had a host require so much of its guests, especially since we really only were there a day and a half. We almost didn't chose this cottage because of this very reason. Before check out, guests must wash all towels, strip all the linens, wash the dishes, turn down the temperature of the cottage, wash and store any beach equipment used, take out all of the trash and pull the bins to the road on trash day, then put them back. this cottages biggest asset is its location. The closeness to everything, including the beach was very nice. The cottage was nice and cozy inside but the floorboards were raised up and shifting all the time. they were not properly installed. I also found a huge roach which was disgusting. The furniture and decorations were nice, although the refrigerator and freezer never got close to cold. All in all I'd stay here again, but not before looking elsewhere first."
13338,413,"The sea biscuit was very cozy, and the best location you could ask for at topsail. Right in the middle of a beach access, and tons of restaurants."
13339,413,My 4th stay at the cottage….I can’t imagine staying anywhere else on the island! It’s perfect!
13340,413,"Awesome location, easy to walk to the beach and restaurants. House was perfect for a family of 4 with two little ones."
13341,413,"Our extended family rented two adjacent cottages and had a great time. The space was great, very clean and had everything we needed. The outdoor space was a huge bonus to be able to bring our whole group together comfortably."
13342,413,"Nicely appointed and very cozy cottage. Plenty of space for up to 4 people, there was only two of us. Very convenient to beach access and to the pier - basically across the street. Walking distance to IGA and several restaurants. Had problems with the fridge, but we moved everything to the freezer for the couple of days we were there. Sure, we'd stay again."
13343,413,"We had a wonderful stay here at the sea biscuit celebrating our dear friend’s bachelorette. The cottage was clean, cozy and filled with small details that made our stay perfect, not to mention the walking distance to everything. We made so many memories here that we will take with us forever. Thank you."
13344,413,Close to perfection.
13345,413,Everything about this cottage is spot on! It was so comfortable and a central location for easy beach access and great restaurants
13346,413,A lovely cottage within walking distance of the beach. The cottage has everything you need for a short or long beach vacation. The owner is quick to respond and can accommodate if your situation changes.
13347,413,"We loved our stay in Surf City - this place is very close to the beach and downtown shops/restaurants. With the exception of dinner at the south end of the island one night, we walked everywhere we went. Having beach chairs and toys to borrow was really great, too!"
13348,413,"What a wonderful stay at Amy’s cottage in Surf City. Perfect location to beach, food, and everything happening near the pier. Interior was comfortable and new. Outside was charming and a classic style cabin you could stay by the beach. Amy was quick on responding and so accommodating to our needs. Highly recommend Amy’s cottage for anyone coming to the Surf City. Thank you!!"
13349,413,"Best place to stay! Short, easy walk to get anywhere you need to go, cute & comfy digs, definitely worth the stay!"
13350,413,"This cottage is perfect for our couples getaway. Everything is a short walk away. We parked our car and walked the island and all it has to offer. The cottage is clean and Amy has thought of everything so the little things like coffee, sugar, condiments, dish soap, and laundry detergent were already there. We appreciated the shed filled with beach needs."
13351,413,"This is hands down the PERFECT cottage in the PERFECT location. Steps away from public beach access (which is a gift since lots are charting $25 per day), blocks from the happening restaurants, bars and shrimp shacks. We felt safe leaving our chairs/beach stuff/shoes out on the front porch and really didn’t hear much commotion even on the weekends. This was ideal for two people but could easily accurate a small family. There was an issue with the refrigerator but Amy was quick and communicative with us about fixing it as well as alternative options. Would 100% recommend and will return!"
13352,413,"Amy's house was great! It's small, but was perfect for us (2 adults, 2 kids). We loved being so close to the beach (the public access is right across the street). The outdoor shower came in handy. The beds were comfy and we all slept well. We'd definitely stay here again!"
13353,413,My family and I had a great time! We loved the house. Very clean! Great location! And will definitely keep this place in mind when we come back to topsail NC
13354,413,"This is the second time we’ve stayed at the Sea Biscuit, and we LOVE it!! Location is amazing!! One minute walk to the beach! Coffee shops, yummy eats of Surf City, grocery, shopping all less than a 5 min walk. The house is clean and well stocked. There is an outside shower that is perfection for rinsing the kids off before heading inside! Thank you Amy and Surf City for the wonderful memories!"
13355,413,"Everything was great, you can tell a lot of thought and time goes into the upkeep of this little cottage-like-house. Great location."
13356,413,The perfect location! The cottage was very clean. It was very nice to have the washer/dryer. All linens were provided. The kitchen had everything we needed. We hope to stay again next summer!
13357,413,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! The location was perfect, and the house had a warm and cozy feel! I definitely recommend staying here."
13358,413,Lovely little cottage. Beach access right across the street. Host is very accommodating and responsive. Will stay there again.
13359,413,This cottage was reasonably priced in beautiful location right of the ocean. Couldn’t have asked for better! Host was also very communicative and understanding
13360,413,Prime location! Such a cute cottage to stay in. Stayed for a short girls trip and enjoyed every moment spend here. It had everything we needed and more. So glad we found this super cute place to stay at! Highly recommend staying here if you want to be close to the beach and walking distance to stores.
13361,413,Great place to stay. Easy walk to the beach and restaurants.
13362,413,"Wonderful little beach cottage in an ideal location to everything. The cottage was perfect and the bike, boards, chair and outdoor shower are plus."
13363,413,Perfect in every way!
13364,413,"Wonderful stay for our family during Thanksgiving! Cozy, clean and had everything we needed to get through and have a great time together with family."
13365,413,"Can't say enough about this perfect little cottage. Walking distance to the pier and restaurants. Steps away from beach access. Kitchen is well equipped, as is the remainder of the cottage. Tasteful decor throughout. Everything you need is within walking distance, you could really unpack and not have to drive for the duration of your trip, if you desire."
13366,413,"This place was absolutely perfect for the four of us for a wedding weekend. Husband, 6 mo old son, grandmother and I enjoyed Amy’s cottage so much. The baby’s pack n play fit great right next to the bed. We loved the front porch and comfortable living room. Everything was very clean and exactly as described."
13367,413,The property was comfortable and clean. Very close to the beach and to shops and restaurants. We had a very enjoyable stay.
13368,413,"As a couple, we found the house to be clean, charming and cozy place to stay. Location is wonderful. You can walk to restaurants, the grocery store, the beach and the pier at the beach. Host was slow to respond to the messages that we sent.

At first it appears that there is only a washing machine but the washing machine incorporates a ventless electric dryer. The LG manual that comes with the washing machine was no help. Found a way to use it as a dryer only, on the LG website. To start the dryer turn on the power and then press the dry button repeatedly."
13369,413,Perfect location. Very charming cottage.
13370,413,Wonderful location and beautiful cottage! It was beyond my expectations! Amy was wonderful to communicate with! This cottage is beautifully decorated! A++++
13371,413,Great location with easy beach access. Good size for small family or couples. The porch was perfect to sit on with the ocean breeze.
13372,413,Adorable cottage in a very convenient location. Amy was a wonderful host and was very quick to respond with questions and needs.
13373,413,The beach house is absolutely adorable and in a great spot close to beach access! It was nice to be able to walk and not worry about parking at all during the stay! I’d definitely come back and stay again!
13374,413,"This is a cute little cottage right across the road from beach access. It's also right in Surf City, so you can walk to get dinner, etc. Minor downside to that is a little noisy at night. But you'll sleep well on the comfortable beds. The rooms are small but well appointed. Kitchen is updated. It's really nice to have a small front porch, and in the shared shed there's all kinds of stuff to take to the beach. That was a really nice perk. We had a good time. No complaints at all about the place!"
13375,413,This cottage is in a great location and very clean! We loved walking to the beach and hopping in the outdoor shower afterwards. There are plenty of restaurants and shops within walking distance also. Perfect place for our family of 3!
13376,413,"Amy was a very kind and polite person to talk to. She wanted us to enjoy our stay. Unfortunately, the fridge broke down while we were there (which is no fault of hers), but she worked very hard to accommodate for that.

The cottage is a little small, but the space is very well used. It was very clean and it was such a treat to be so close to the shore, grocery store, and pier that you could walk to everything."
13377,413,"This was a wonderful place. Amy was so responsive and accommodating. This cottage is so convenient to the beach, shops, restaurants and ice cream! We also loved sitting on the front porch in the afternoons! The house is very well equipped. We realized we could have left so many things at home! Thank you for a wonderful stay, Amy!"
13378,413,"We had a great time in Surf City. Seabiscuit is the perfect beach cottage. It has everything you need [Beach chairs, bikes, chairs on the front porch, outdoor shower, big, comfy couch and great mattresses] for a perfect beach vacation. The location is amazing. It takes about 3 minutes to walk from the cottage to the beach. The beach was not crowded. Good beach for little kids. Bring your boogie boards and a beach shelter. Stores and restaurants are very close. We walked everywhere. Everyone we met was very nice. We will be coming back next year."
13379,413,Great place to stay and a great location.
13380,413,"Very cute little cottage. We’re just a family of 3 so house was a good size for us. Location of house was great. Really enjoyed being able to walk to the grocery store and restaurants. Although not oceanfront, we were able to walk back & forth throughout the day. Also appreciated the keyless entry, very convenient, esp for the beach."
13381,413,The AC was amazing lol cute little house and walking distance from the beach! Our cottage only had a washer not a dryer but we would definitely stay again!
13382,413,"Greetings Yamilex. Thank you for taking time to submit a review!
I just want to clarify, the unit in Sea Biscuit is actually a brand new LG Combo Washer and Dryer. You can just wash a load or choose to set a full cycle for washing and drying. It is a little different and a learning curve but much more compact for a smaller location! Quick instructions are on the back top right of the combo machine. I apologize for any confusion this may have caused and welcome you back anytime!"
13383,413,"We had a fantastic visit to Surf City and our stay at your Sea Biscuit cottage. It was quaint, comfortable and what a fantastic location! We hope to be back"
13384,413,"We absolutely loved this little cottage. It came completely stocked with everything you could possibly need from a surf board to a first aid kit and even some cleaning supplies. The location is perfect and was safe. The beach is a quick walk across the street, and there are many restaurants/ice cream/coffee/donut shops within walking distance. We love that it had an outdoor shower and beach supplies like chairs and an umbrella. The cottage was clean and we were greeted with some fresh flowers on the table. The beds were clean and comfortable. The AC worked really well which was nice on the 90 + degree days we had. We definitely feel like we got our money's worth and hope to return."
13385,413,"Perfect location, loved the nice breezy front porch and the outdoor shower was Heaven 🙌"
13386,413,Great lil cottage in the perfect spot..only a walk across the street to the beach n waking distanceto pretty much every store!! We were able to just park n not bother getting the car after that!! Cottage was very clean n had everything you needed!!
13387,413,"What a charming cottage! Would definitely stay again. Well decorated, very clean and all the amenities of home. We loved our stay!"
13388,413,"Perfect location! Loved walking to the pier from the house! Such a cute house, and easy access to ocean!"
13389,413,"Everything was great! It was exactly as described. It was clean, in a great location, very cutely decorated, and the ac worked very well. It was always nice to come “home” from a hot day at the beach and be able to use the outdoor shower, then cool off inside. There’s also a public outdoor shower at the beach access right across the street, so we’d usually rinse off there, then the shower again at the house. This was great for helping us not track sand in the house, which always drives me crazy at the beach. There were also tons of great beach items in the shared shed, and even a bike my son could ride. Basically all we really had to bring was our beach cart and bike helmets."
13390,413,"This location was amazing! It is incredibly close to two beach accesses, maybe only a 2-3 minute walk! The beach was also beautiful. The home is right in the center of town, so you can walk everywhere to go to dinner or get a coffee or ice cream. At the home, there is a shared space that includes a outdoor shower and a shed filled with beach items. Even shared, there were still plenty of beach chairs, boogie boards and toys. We definitely enjoyed our stay!"
13391,413,"Fantastic location! Just steps to the beach, restaurants, bars. So convenient!"
13392,413,Wonderful little cottage. Perfect spot for all the good food and everything is in walking distance. Amy has everything you need and she is a wonderful host. Perfect for the occasion!
13393,413,"Great little house, right next to beach access. Plenty of space for 4 people to enjoy"
13394,413,Delightful cottage! Close to everything! Loved it and I definitely will go back.
13395,413,"Beautifully appointed cottage conveniently located just a few steps from the beach. Had to contact the host once on a minor issue, and she immediately sent out the maintenance man. Kitchen was well equipped; great towels and linens too. Loved it."
13396,413,"We always love staying at Amy’s properties! Beautiful home and the location could not get any better! Outdoor shower is so convenient with the beach being right across the way.
Cant wait for our next trip!"
13397,413,"Great place. The perfect amount of space, easy beach access and plenty of food is walking distance. We will be back!"
13398,413,You can expect an amazing place to rest your head while being so close to the beach and everything else that Surf City has to offer
13399,413,"I cannot rave enough about this little cottage. The kitchen is fully stocked, the beds were comfortable and the cottage is updated and clean. AND THE LOCATION!!! You are steps from the beach, restaurants and shops! There has definitely been a lot thought put into making this a cozy home away from home. One of the best Air BnBs we've ever stayed out! Highly recommend!"
13400,413,"Amy’s place is cute and clean, across the street from the beach, and near all the downtown amenities in town. My girls thought the outdoor shower was pretty great."
13401,413,"This place was perfect for our weekend trip. Great location, close to everything."
13402,413,Amy’s “Sea Biscuit” cottage is perfect! My sister and I spent Thanksgiving here and the kitchen had everything we needed to make a full feast. The cottage is comfy and cozy with the most comfortable couch and beds! The beach is literally across the street. You can hear the waves from the porch (there are two porches btw!). The location is central to everything and across the street from the Surf City pier. Amy is so friendly and hospitable! She’s also been great to communicate with. Highly recommend booking Sea Biscuit!
13403,413,"We absolutely loved our stay at Sea Biscuit! This home is within just a few steps of everything you need in the heart of Surf City. We walked to the pier, the new bridge, park and beach. Amy was so kind and responsive, the house was clean and beautifully decorated. We loved all the extras...coffee pods, beach chairs and the very useful outdoor shower. We would absolutely recommend anyone stay in this sweet house and can't wait to return ourselves!"
13404,413,Great place right near our favorite beach!
13405,413,"Absolutely as advertised! Great location, very very clean, great amenities! Amy is a wonderful host! We will definitely be back."
13406,413,This location couldn't ha e been better! We loved being able to walk to literally everything and beach just across the street!
13407,413,If you want to be in the heart of it all this place is for you. We had a few issues and Amy was quick with her communication. We enjoyed being so close to all the shops and restaurants.
13408,413,Sea biscuit is in the ❤️ of Surf City. The cottage is close to 2 beach accesses and a small grocery store! While there check out Shaka Taco and Daddy Mac’s (a short 3 minute walk). The cottage is very clean and comfy. Amy was a great host and quickly responded to any questions we had.
13409,413,"Perfect location, just across the street from public beach access. The house was clean and cozy. We had room
to stick a pack n play halfway in the closet of one of the rooms so our little one was able to sleep well. The kitchen was well stocked."
13410,413,"Awesome location, Amy was great"
13411,413,"Beautiful cottage!! Location was perfect! Walking distance to everything(even with 3 little kids!) The beach, coffee, food, & dessert! The cottage was clean and cozy. The outdoor shower has cold and hot water which was amazing for rinsing off after the beach!"
13412,413,"Seabiscuit is fantastic!! Walkable to the beach, stores, shops and restaurants. Cute little house without sharing walls with neighbors."
13413,413,"Stay at the best location in Surf City! We parked our car to unpack and never opened it back up for 3 days. You are a block from the beach, amazing sunsets on the bridge, Shaka Taco, Buddy's, the pier and of course the beach. Such a cool town and such a great place to experience it from. There is coffee, comfy beds, and extra outdoor amenities but no dishwasher. We would go back!"
13414,413,Great host - very quick and helpful communication.
13415,413,The place was so comfortable we almost felt like we were at home(only there was an ocean across the street!). Very well stocked kitchen with anything we needed. Would definitely go back to this cottage!
13416,413,"We loved the Sea Biscuit. This such a nice cottage and we felt right at home....comfy beds and super comfy couch. We loved the location with the beach, restaurants, stores and everything so close!!! We def want to stay again!!!"
13417,413,Great place! Good location! Good value!
13418,413,"Amy’s place was perfect for our family! The home was so close to everything- within walking distance of shops, restaurants, and a grocery store. We loved how close it was to the beach the best! Ideal location! The house was so cozy with helpful amenities and a very well stocked kitchen. There were lots of thoughtful touches throughout. The beds and couch were so comfortable too! We definitely will be back to this cute home!"
13419,413,Great place. So quaint and the beach access can't be beat. We loved staying there
13420,413,Great place ideally located across the street from the beach! We would definitely stay there again if we end up back in Surf City
13421,413,Great location for access to beach. Clean. Cozy. Affordable. Can’t wait to go again!
13422,413,"Amy's cottage was a wonderful place to stay while vacationing in Surf City! My husband, 8 year old daughter and I appreciated all of the many thoughtful touches that made our stay comfortable. The linens were all fresh and clean and beds comfortable. The house was very clean and the space was well laid out for a small family. This is the most convenient location you can imagine given the proximity to all of the places you want to visit while in Surf City, only steps away from the beach, the pier, the waterway, restaurants, shops and a grocery store. Amy was very attentive and available at a moments notice to answer any questions. She welcomed us with warmth and kindness and was eager to make sure we enjoyed our visit!"
13423,413,My parents found this charming home for myself and fiance as we were getting married on Topsail Beach
13424,413,"We had a wonderful stay at the cottage. We loved the cozy feel. This cottage is perfect for a couple or a family of 4. The location is perfect. It is right in the middle of EVERYTHING. Restaurants, shops, the pier, and public access to the beach are all only a block away. Amy was a wonderful host. The cottage was very clean and beautifully decorated. We will definitely be back!"
13425,413,"Beautiful cottage and perfect location. Had all the necessities and was able to easily walk with my two kids (age 4 and6) to donuts and coffee in the morning, and food in the evening. Beach was literally steps away and the host was so easy to communicate with. We will be back!!"
13426,413,"The cutest little cottage! We had the best time. Super clean (and I am picky!), beds and couch are very comfortable, So many little touches that made our stay easy (hand soap, tp, paper towels, beach chairs, boogie boards, bikes). The walk to the beach was much easier/shorter than expected. We loved being able to walk to stores and restaurants and only used our car once! This is definitely the busier part of the island but even so, we had no issues with noise. Amy was a super host and even left fresh flowers on the table. We will most definitely be back."
13427,413,"Amy is a super gracious host who has made a cozy nest just steps away from the beautiful ocean! The view from the house itself is limited, but it’s a great escape after a day of sun, wind and waves! Good parking, everything you need in the stylish house, and privacy as a stand-alone, with two sweet porches. Many cheerful little restaurants, etc (shaved ice) just a couple short blocks away, and beach access practically across the street. Thanks, Amy!"
13428,418,"Great hostess, easy access and perfect location. We enjoyed and would like to return"
13429,418,"Upon arriving the house is very hidden and directions don’t help much in the dark. The 4th bedroom is located on the lowest level and is ONLY accessible from outside and is completely secluded from the rest of the house. Inside the house, there were holes everywhere in the wall like someone had walked around and punched holes everywhere. Some of the holes were patched and left unpainted. There was tape everywhere. The paint was also chipped and scraped off everywhere. The smoke detector in the bedroom was disconnected. The curtains in the bedrooms are completely see though as well as no curtain in the bathroom. There was hairs all over the beds and the bed sheets were pilling. All of this was completely unseen in all the pictures. There were layers of dust in the lamp in one of the bedrooms and in the other bedroom, there was a hole hacked out of the nightstand. The grill outside is unusable & filthy. Would not recommend without remodeling and a good cleaning first."
13430,418,"Great home, Everything we needed to make us feel at home."
13431,418,"The location of this home was perfect! You feel like you are in the woods, but it is just a short drive to downtown. The kitchen was well stocked and the home was exactly as described. Tiff was a great host and quick to respond to my questions. Self check-in was a breeze!"
13432,418,Such a cute cabin with beautiful views of the woods!! It was clean and spacious. The host was very helpful and easy to contact!
13433,418,Perfect location. No more than 10-15 minutes from anything you will most likely want to do. For the price of this Airbnb I wish there were enough supplies (toilet paper & paper towels) to make it through our stay and functional lightning in the living room. Other than that it was a great time.
13434,418,"Tiff's house made for a great stay in Asheville for us. You really cannot beat the location and value for your money. It being on a mountain it would be easier to transit in a AWD or 4WD vehicle (mostly the driveway). There were some things we noticed about the house that were minor that needed attention, but the essentials were definitely met. It was more than enough room and the outdoor space was nice. Especially the firepit. The photos of where the hammock chair is on the listing must be from a bit ago, because the furniture on that deck seems much less new then in the photos. There was an issue with the cleaners when we checked in, but Tiff was very prompt and gave us a credit to make up for it. This was great customer service considering the mistake. As said before we loved the firepit and it was awesome that they provided firewood to use. Grill and kitchen are both capable and we liked sitting outside on the picnic table near the grill while eating breakfast. It was a nice forest view and felt cozy and remote, despite being only 15 min from downtown. Overall I would recommend Tiff's place, it was a great stay."
13435,418,Fabulous mountain house! Located near the Blue Ridge Parkway for great hikes to beautiful vistas. Convenient to activities in and around Asheville. On our list for a return visit!
13436,418,"Overall, we had a great time. Upon arrival, (15 min after checkin time which was 4 pm) the bottom part of the house had not been cleaned. I did not receive a message from Tiff until 4:30 after we were already at the home, that they were behind on cleaning for the day. It would have been nice to know earlier in the day if the check in was going to be late and we could have made plans accordingly. She did send us a credit though to help a little. The driveway wasn’t as bad as the other reviews but we did all have small SUVs. There were a lot of broken things in the house (lights that didn’t work, lack of smoke detectors upstairs, loose toilets) but nothing that was unmanageable just not fun to deal with. Overall it was a great space for our group and met our needs and most expectations."
13437,418,Wonderful house in the mountains! Great for a weekend getaway from the hustle of everyday life! Secluded but only 20 min from downtown through windy mountain roads! We had a great stay!
13438,418,Great place for a stay in Asheville! Has all you need and host is easy to work with.
13439,418,"House not up to par for a rental for what they charge, needs updating, driveway very hard to get out of, top and bottom of home do not connect, check the freezer to see if it is functioning, kitchen cabinets very wobbly, spiders all over, table on porch had nails sticking up and leaves all over, like it was not cleaned up for us. Needs better clean up and upkeep."
13440,418,"We had a great time in Asheville! I loved that the house was tucked into the woods but still only 10-15 minutes from downtown. It fit 7 of us perfectly. It has a really nice fire pit with chairs. My only complaint would be the driveway and the deck. As previous reviews mentioned the driveway and deck needs some love. I hope they level the driveway out or someone could really damage their vehicle. The front deck is in pretty rough condition, the back deck was much better.
Overall I feel it was worth the money and fit a small group perfectly!"
13441,418,Great place with easy access to nature and downtown Asheville. Beds are comfortable and we felt like we could make ourselves at home. Definitely recommend!
13442,418,"The house is somewhat secluded and we saw rabbits. deer, and even a bear! The kitchen is great and had everything we needed. The beds were very comfortable and there was enough seating for all of us. The outdoor amenities need a little TLC but overall our stay was very nice."
13443,418,"Great location for the Biltmore and downtown Asheville. Directions and instructions for checkin were very detailed and helpful. The driveway is washed out with deep ruts in one spot but fortunately, we had SUVs. The house had some small repairs in progress in the bathrooms but was overall clean and comfortable for our group. Recommend this house for a fun getaway in the mountains!"
13444,418,"Place was great! Deep in the woods so very private. Perfect for our group.

One note - the pull out couch was a small fold down futon. Just a note to future renters if you’re counting it towards your 10 people - it’s rather small. Luckily still worked out for our group."
13445,418,"This is a beautiful property. Perfect for a calm relaxing getaway. If you want to sit by the fire, enjoy s’mores, and sleep in a comfortable setting, this is your home. Tiff has everything covered for you and is a joy to work with. We will be back!"
13446,418,"Our group had an overall good experience with this space. The location is a bit off the beaten path, but easily accessible from the airport and downtown, which were both ~15 minutes away. As noted in other reviews, there is a basement room downstairs that is only accessible via a staircase outdoors.

I did want to note that the host was extremely unresponsive. I sent 2 messages to her prior to our check-in date, and never received a response throughout our entire stay, which was 3 nights. There was also no phone number provided by the host for contact purposes. As such, I highly suggest that you send any questions/messages to the host multiple days in advance of your stay, if needed."
13447,418,The place was amazing and we love how it was pretty secluded.
13448,418,"I’m very disappointed in this place. While it does look like the photos, we didn’t feel like it was clean.. I wouldn’t stay here again"
13449,418,"We enjoyed our stay at this home but we felt the listing was a bit off. Based on the pictures and the price point, we were expecting a slightly higher quality place. Some of the kitchen cabinets were falling a bit, there were handles/knobs that had fallen off various doors, the toilets were very wobbly, etc. An important thing to point out is that there is no indoor access to the bedroom that is in the basement. We did have 4 children with us so having to go outside to access this room/space wasn't the most ideal. I didn't see that mentioned in the listing but I could have missed it. For many, it probably isn't a concern but because we had young children with us, it would have been preferable to have indoor access."
13450,418,Beautiful setting
13451,418,Really enjoyed my stay at tiffs place in Asheville! It’s definitely more UP in the mountains than we anticipated but it was a wonderful place!
13452,418,"This house was the perfect fit for a birthday getaway weekend. It was roomy enough for 7 adults. We enjoyed being tucked away in the mountain while still only being about 15 minutes from downtown. We were even able to get an Uber on a Saturday night with only a 20 minute wait.
I will say were surprised that the bottom portion of the house was completely separate from the rest of the house but it wasn’t a huge deal. One tip- the driveway is definitely more suited for a truck or larger suv due to bumps and corrosion. We had trucks so it wasn’t bad but I’d imagine someone in a sedan may have some issues. Overall it was a great stay and plan to keep this place bookmarked for when we plan our next Asheville trip."
13453,418,"The cabin fit us nicely, but there were different quirks of the cabin (the downstairs not accessible to upstairs inside, you have to go outside) that were a little annoying. The driveway had some bad bumps too which were a little perilous for our cars as well."
13454,418,n/a
13455,418,The location is great! It is off the beaten path enough to feel secluded but only 15-20 minutes away from anything in Asheville you wanna do.
13456,418,Great place!
13457,418,"We enjoyed our Pre Christmas holiday with my extended family here! We came from Florida, Georgia, & Ohio to spend 4 nights together in this mountain gem. The living area is a bit smaller than it seems in pictures but it can work. Probably not the best for young children for lack of space. The driveway is best for all wheel drive. Gravel is steep. Tiff provided a lot of extra touches & communicated with me throughout my stay."
13458,418,"Good location, equipped kitchen. Nicely decorated."
13459,418,"The house was good for what we needed! We stayed for just one night while passing through Asheville. It’s a quiet, wooded area about 20ish minutes to downtown Asheville. Just a heads up the 4th bedroom you have to access from a separate entrance outside. It took us a little bit to figure that out lol. The host was very responsive and we were able to check in a little bit early :) overall it was good!"
13460,418,"We booked this Airbnb for the week of thanksgiving . On our way there, we got lost a few times. The roads were quite narrow and at some point we lost signal. When we arrived, we were not pleased with the exterior of the home as it looked neglected. The grills were dirty and unusable and there was no wood to use the fire place . We would’ve gladly purchased wood prior, if the host would’ve specify . One of the bathrooms and a bedroom did not have a working light. Our intention was to cook as a family, thanksgiving dinner, but it became challenging when we realized the pots and pans were rusted and the oven was dirty . All in all, if you are looking for a place in the woods but close to downtown , this place will do . If you are looking for a place to gather as a family not ideal ."
13461,418,"Great place to stay! Leavers were changing colors and the drive and landscape was great. This place is close enough if you need to go to town or get groceries, but far enough away to feel out of the city. Really enjoyed the stay!"
13462,418,Lovely home. A large group of us were in town for a show and this was the perfect home base for us to hang out before the show and regroup after. Would love to come again and have more time to enjoy the beautiful porches and fire pit.
13463,418,"Beautiful home in the woods! Great fire pit for one of our evenings there. The winding roads to get there made for an adventure. Great home, we just needed more days there to enjoy it longer."
13464,418,"Great house. Very clean and well taken care of. Close enough to things, yet also secluded. The only thing that could be a issue for some is that the lower level is not connected to the rest of the house. We were able to make it work for us, but it could present a problem for some especially if rooms are needed for small children. Otherwise a 5 star experience and we would definitely stay here again."
13465,418,"The house was tidy, cozy, and perfect fit for 8 of us! Saw some of the comments about difficulties getting Ubers, but we had more success with Lyft. We didn’t have any issues requesting during the day and initiated requests 20-30 minutes before we needed to leave because it took a little bit of time to get our request picked up. I think it has more to do with the number of drivers working right now than the location of the house.
The views from the house are stunning as well. We enjoyed walking around the neighborhood in the mornings and took advantage of the multiple outdoor spaces. My only regret was not staying longer.
Tiff was also a responsive and accommodating host. Highly recommend!"
13466,418,"The home is beautiful and very spacious with plenty of room both indoors and outdoors, so it’s great for a trip with a group of friends. Everything looked just like it did in the pictures, it is such a lovely home. Something to note about the layout; we did find out that the second master room & suite were not connected to the main house upstairs. We had to go outside and walk down the stairs to get to the bottom floor, not an issue at all just something we weren’t expecting. We also had little to no cell service, which was tl be expected. This wouldn’t have been an issue if we were just planning a weekend getaway in the house. However, we were there for a bachelorette and we had plans to make it downtown for the breweries, but we had little to no luck getting Uber/Lyft. We even tried to order pizza one night and our delivery driver was lost for 1/2 an hour, with no cell service to call us and ask for directions. So if you’re trying to get to and from downtown AVL it’s best to plan to drive yourself. I did want to note that there was poor communication from the host. Before the trip I sent questions about check-in and the amenities, but never got a reply. Even after leaving, I had a question about something that may have been left behind and again, I never heard back from the host. A simple reply would have been helpful, but I never heard back about anything. Overall, We enjoyed our stay but just wanted to note these things from our experience."
13467,418,"Great place, really easy to find, and it was about 15minutes away from downtown Asheville."
13468,418,"Cute little house in the mountains. The downstairs is separate from the rest of the house, so not ideal if you're trying to stay in a whole continuous house. It's not as close to downtown Asheville as I had thought, and it was difficult to request Ubers to the house, but not bad in general. Heads up: the private road to get to the house is a one-lane street so no buses or larger vehicles."
13469,418,"Lovely home tucked away in the mountains, but close enough to access the city quickly. Adequate space for a larger group (we had 9) both inside and outdoors. Many peaceful nights outside surrounded by the wilderness!"
13470,418,This house was very nice and peaceful. We had a great time using the bonfire and laying by the hammock. Ubers got lost a bit going into the woods but the directions given by the host were helpful. Very quaint and nice for a group of 4 couples max to be able to seep on the comfortable beds.
13471,418,Amazing home!!
13472,418,Had a great time. It’s a great secluded area for family or friend bonding time. The road to the house for the last 10 minutes is a winding narrow road but we actually enjoyed the experience. The hosts had plates and cups and regular home supplies which were very helpful. It’s a 2-in-1 home with 2 different entrances. It actually worked out well for us
13473,418,"Our mountain getaway was just wonderful. The house was immaculate and Tiff, the owner was so responsive and helpful. The house is very convenient to Asheville and environs. Road was a bit steep to maneuver but once we got used to it, the setting is beautiful, woodsy and private. Saw deer on my morning walks."
13474,418,.
13475,418,"This is such a lovely property! Near enough to Asheville to be convenient but far enough out for things to feel secluded/private. Great for larger groups, with a ton of outdoor hangout space. :)"
13476,418,"This is a great house in a great location, very clean, and the host is very professional. Went there for a bachelor party and we had a great time and never had to travel more than 15-20 minutes when we went out to golf or visit some of the breweries"
13477,418,"Great home in the mountains! If you are looking for a quiet place with lots of space this is it! It is about 20 minutes from most things, and Uber is limited in the area, so you will need a vehicle."
13478,418,Beautiful and cozy spot tucked away in the mountains but just a short drive from downtown! Lots of space inside and out—highly recommend!
13479,418,"Listing is very accurate, great locationand amenities for a long weekend"
13480,418,"Tiff was great to work with, the house fit our needs, and we were all very pleased with the whole experience. Thank you for the Asheville recommendations too, Tiff!"
13481,418,"Tiff's place was one of the best Airbnbs we've ever stayed in! Every amenity you could think of and more was included. The house was very spacious, stylish and has two beautiful decks and a grill. We loved sitting by the fire pit, which included wood. The kitchen was well-appointed and accommodated multiple meals for a large group. It was only 15 minutes from town and super convenient to a grocery store. Tiff also provided a wonderful list of recommended places to eat and things to do. We will definitely be back!"
13482,418,"We had a wonderful time at the house! It was clean, Tiff communicated well and gave great local tips!"
13483,418,Beautiful mountain location in an older home. Tiff was helpful when needed.
13484,418,Tiff was a great host! Highly recommended
13485,418,"Tiff's place was a wonderful getaway for my friends!
The house is nestled on a hill just a short 15-minute drive from downtown.
The space was very stylish and was suitable for our group (7 people).

If you're looking for a great space, value and location, this is the Airbnb to book in Asheville."
13486,418,Great location. Very clean house. Modern furniture.
13487,418,"Great location, nice amenities, and excellent/accurate communication from the hosts. We will gladly comeback!"
13488,418,"We enjoyed our stay at Tiff's place. The location is a bit hard to find, no cell service once there, but WIFI works well. The house feels smaller than in photos, esp main living area, but well decorated. The house smelled very strongly of burned firewood when we got there, we cleaned out the indoor fireplace/stove (which was full of ashes), that helped some but the smell was very strong and lingered our entire stay even after leaving windows open. As a result, our clothing smelled strongly of burned firewood as well. The kitchen is pretty, but not well stocked. We were unable to find any normal size drinking glasses, all the glasses were about 4-6oz. There were also not many plates. The dishwasher did not work well, as a result many of the dishes in the cabinets were dirty. We had to buy our own trash bags and paper towels. Overall, the house felt like it had been cleaned but it also felt a bit grungy. The baseboards, corners, under furniture, window sills felt like they needed some attention. The master bath on main level had some holes in the walls that were patched but unpainted. The water pressure was great, and water was super hot which I really enjoyed. Bath linen seemed sparse, but the day we left I found more in a closet under the stairs. Washer and dryer worked well. Tiff provided a long list of recommendations which was also nice. House was in a secluded area, lots of privacy, some good flat space to run around."
13489,418,great home and cool hikes in the area
13490,418,"Cozy, comfortable beautiful place to get away!"
13491,418,"Great, stylish space in the mountains. Beautiful, quiet and serene. A little difficult to find an Uber or Lyft to and from. Bring paper towels and napkins if you’ll be eating in."
13492,418,"Beautiful , modern, and cozy."
13493,418,Beautiful home with amazing views!
13494,418,"Tiff’s place was exactly what my friends and I were looking for, literally in the middle of nowhere, calm and quiet retreat. The place was gorgeous with many thoughtful finishing touches. Super clean and Tiff was great at communicating with us!"
13495,418,Lovely duplex in the middle of the woods. Would love to stay her again.
13496,418,"Loved our stay - great location, clean space and Tiff had awesome recommendations. Would 100% stay again!"
13497,418,"Tiff’s place was great. Overall a cozy place to stay for the weekend. My friends and I just hung out together for a little getaway and it was perfect. Any issues I had while there, Tiff responded quickly and very effectively. Great stay!"
13498,432,This house had everything we needed and more for our first time in Boone! The location was perfect. The house came with everything we needed and the ping pong table was an added bonus! We will definitely be back. Thanks for hosting us!
13499,432,We were in Boone on a college tour of App state university. We were close to the campus and downtown. Perfect location and Adam and Debra were great to work with!!
13500,432,We really enjoyed our stay! Very cute and clean house so convenient to downtown Boone. Hosts have thought of everything and we appreciated all the amenities from coffee to paper towels to shampoo and basic first aid! Would definitely stay again or recommend to friends! Thanks!
13501,432,We had a great stay at Adam and Debra's. We were in Boone for a college visit to App State and the house was a great fit. It was easy to walk to campus and to the shops and restaurants downtown.
13502,432,"Our stay was wonderful! Beautiful home. Decor was great and the location was awesome! Close to downtown, restaurants and grocery stores. Would definitely stay again! Thank you!"
13503,432,Great location
13504,432,"The owners were super responsive. We only had one issue with a flipped breaker, and Adam quickly responded and told me how to get it fixed. The house was immaculate and legally stocked. One of the most well-stocked houses I’ve ever stayed in. Definitely stay here again if traveling to be. Very close to AB State campus. Great host"
13505,432,Had a pleasant stay here. Adam and Debra were quick to respond to accommodate our needs and instructions were clear. Place was kept clean and tidy.
13506,432,"Location, location, location. Great option located in the heart of Boone. Right off King st. We will definitely be staying here again!"
13507,432,"Location was great to downtown Boone. The house of spacious, clean, and very nice. We had everything we needed for a nice weekend getaway to pick out our Christmas tree and visit Tweetsie Christmas. Definitely would stay here again. The only thing we needed was better Wi-Fi connection with television for the evening."
13508,432,Loved our stay! Home is perfectly close to campus and well-appointed with lots of little touches. Look forward to staying here again!!!
13509,432,Great place to stay! We can’t wait to go back.
13510,432,Cute place and convenient location. Owner quick to respond to an issue we had. Will stay here again.
13511,432,"Adam and Debra’s rental was very clean, and all amenities were as advertised. It’s location can’t be beat. I recommend highly."
13512,432,The house is in a great location for shopping and ASU. Very quit neighborhood. Well stocked with anything you could need.
13513,432,Adam and Debra's place is great. Clean with very comfortable accommodations. Everything you need for a stay away from home. But the location to campus and King Street can't be beat!!
13514,432,"We loved our stay at Adam and Debra’s house! The house was clean, well stocked with a full kitchen, and centrally located to campus and downtown Kings Street."
13515,432,"Great location, and very clean!"
13516,432,"Easy check-in, table tennis table in garage was a bonus. Clean and comfortable."
13517,432,Great time and very great hosts!
13518,432,"Excellently appointed home very close to campus. Our trip was only overnight this time, and it was such a relief to find a comfortable and conveniently located house! Thank you!"
13519,432,"The place was perfect! It’s super clean, updated, and in a perfect location to kings street. My wife and I have a little one so it was great for him being one level with a flat lot and great back yard for him to walk around and play in. We even had baby deer come visit and sun bath in the back yard in the mornings! We will definitely be back."
13520,432,We had a great stay in Boone. The house was just as described and was a great location near the town. Very clean and fresh. Nice deck out back. We would definitely stay here again.
13521,432,Great place and a short walk to Kings street!
13522,432,Nice place and yard. They had everything we needed for a comfortable stay.
13523,432,"Adam and Debra""s place was the perfect base to explore Boone amd the surrounding area. Very clean, plenty of room and welll stocked, Eating in and dropping by to change/rest up were very convenient. Downtown Boone is a short walk. Excellent accomodations, would come back."
13524,432,We had a great stay in Boone! This property is a 15 minute walk to App state's campus and numerous restaurants. It had a great porch to enjoy coffee or drinks! We didnt cook but the kitchen was clean and well-stocked. Would recommend!
13525,432,"Adam and Debra are excellent hosts! They respond immediately to questions and go out of their way to be helpful. I highly recommend their place! The home is immaculately clean. Large recently Renovated well stocked kitchen with new appliances. New hi efficiency washer dryer. Comfortable beds, Turkish towels. 4 large TVs! One in each bedroom and one in the living room. 2 large bathrooms. Plenty of closet space. Nice sitting room without a TV also. Everything in the house worked as it was supposed to and there was nothing to try to figure out! We enjoyed sitting on the back deck and watching the birds and chipmunks. Quiet street off King St. We walked to restaurants and shops. My trip to Boone unexpectedly turned out to be a difficult time for me personally and I was not the best guest. ( dropped and broke a glass then checked out mistakenly leaving personal belongs behind) Adam and Debra were very patient, understanding and helpful. I am a grateful guest."
13526,432,Its so nice to have such a nice place right downtown
13527,432,"Amazing location, walked downtown every day. Clean beautiful home and excellent hosts. Not a single negative thing to say. Thanks again!"
13528,432,"Clean, adorable home. Owners were so easy to work with. We enjoyed the location and the lovely NC charm."
13529,432,"Great home for a reunion of college friends. The ping pong table was so fun, comfy beds and well equipped kitchen..... entire home was so clean!!! Highly recommend.!"
13530,432,Enjoyed our stay. Place was very comfortable and convenient to graduation activities.
13531,432,Great place with plenty of space to unwind after a full day. Only a few minutes from downtown which was perfect. Everything in the pictures and description was accurate. We will definitely be coming back again soon!
13532,432,Perfect location for spending time at App State and downtown Boone. Super clean house and very accommodating hosts. Thanks!
13533,432,"If you are looking to stay at the perfect place in Boone, reserve this NOW. The house is fully redone and spotless. You cannot find a better location."
13534,432,What a super cute home! Great location. Couldn't ask for better hosts!
13535,441,"The apartment is very beautiful, it’s in a great space in downtown Durham. My issue was our check-in process and the complete lack of professionalism from the company. On our first night, there was no key in the lock box, no one was answering the phone or our text messages, as soon as we called, we got no answer, but someone texted us from Pendleton to ask what was wrong, we let them know we had no key to get inside, and didn’t hear anything back for three hours. we had to sit outside in the rain until a friendly neighbor buzzed us in. Throughout this whole ordeal, Justin from Pendleton, a.k.a. our host on Airbnb never answered any of my phone calls. Much later that night, i was told the code for another box (I was not told which lockbox it would be, so I ended up having to try all of them, looking like a crazy person trying to break into peoples apartments)

Justin never responded, and if it wasn’t for that friendly neighbor on the first night, we wouldn’t have even gotten in."
13536,441,Stay was amazing. Better than advertised.
13537,441,Thanks Xavier! We enjoyed hosting you.
13538,441,"we arrived at 4:15 pm the apartment hadn’t been cleaned. air Beds and sheets from the previous occupants were still out and not cleaned, towels were not washed, dishes were not done, there was broken glass and a broken curtain in one of the bedrooms, and the trash hadn’t been taken out and was greatly overflowing. We reached out on Airbnb and via the text service the renter claims to provide, but we never heard back. We didn’t hear back until 9:00 at which point they sent a cleaning person, however I had already started cleaning myself. We would have rebooked somewhere else but there were multiple events in town so there literally weren’t any options in downtown Durham. Even when the cleaning person came, they realized the dishwasher was broken, they didn’t have enough pillow cases, didn’t fix the curtain rod? and they forgot to take the trash out with them when they left.

The location is great. But given my experience I wouldn’t stay again. They were unresponsive and unhelpful."
13539,441,"We are very sorry for the mix-up with our community cleaning partner. You are correct, that is not acceptable. As you are aware, we received your message, responded at 7:40, and contacted one of our cleaning partners who came over to the apartment as soon as possible that very evening. We also sent you another message to try to make things right, but unfortunately never received a response. For any guests reading this review, please note this is not a typical experience. We apologized, made it right, and would certainly love to hear from you with any questions you may have before booking."
13540,441,"Great location but the place was not cleaned before our arrival. Dirty beds, no clean towels, leftover trash. Wonderful spot but unfortunately it was not cleaned before hand. Very disappointing."
13541,441,We're very sorry to hear about this mix-up! We'll reach out to you via Airbnb message.
13542,441,"It was a very cute downtown/city vibe. Upon arrival we discovered several mistakes by the cleaning crew. Two trash cans left full and VERY stinky, coffee grounds left in the coffee pot and they had been there several days. On the table they leave a complimentary wine and two glasses, but one was broken. All these discoveries were sent to the host with ZERO response. So we spent the weekend smelling the trash due to no outdoor trash service. There was 4 of us to share 2 towels for the weekend. It is very noisy at night and with there being a bar/restaurant underneath that creates even more noise. Just expected the building itself to be a little more sound proof."
13543,441,"Oh no! We're sorry our team dropped the ball and we'll certainly follow up with our community cleaning partners. This is surely not a typical experience for our guests, and we hope we have the opportunity to make it up to you when next you're in town."
13544,441,Second year in a row we’ve stayed here. Perfect spot. Cool apartment with great rooftop patio. Highly recommend.
13545,441,"Thank you, Andrew! It was great hosting you again, and we'd love to have you back anytime."
13546,441,Great neighborhood. Lots to do.
13547,441,"Thanks Ken, come back anytime!"
13548,441,"PRIME TIME LOCATION!!
Perfectly Located For Whatever occasion may be that would call for overnight travel in the city of Raleigh,NC!!
You won't be disappointed!"
13549,441,"Thank you, Justin! We enjoyed hosting you."
13550,441,"I absolutely loved the attention to detail when designing this property. The kitchen is beautiful, the charming wood floors and green accent wall add so much character to an already beautiful home. I only wish I could’ve stayed longer!"
13551,441,"Thank you so much, Josh! We enjoyed hosting you."
13552,441,"Great Location, Skyline Views, Walking distance to bars and restaurants. Highly recommended! I would definitely stay here again!"
13553,441,"Thank you, Frederick! We enjoyed hosting you."
13554,441,Great location. Literally in the heart of Durham!! So much to do--would defiantly stay again!!
13555,441,"Thanks Elizabeth, we enjoyed hosting you!"
13556,441,"This is my second time staying here, I had a great stay last time and knew I’d love it again. I wish I could have stayed longer!"
13557,441,"It was great to have you back, Emily! We'd love to host you again whenever you're in town."
13558,441,Great vibe and great location! We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go! I will definitely book again for future DPAC visits!
13559,441,"Thank you, Heather! We enjoyed hosting you and will look forward to having you back next time."
13560,441,"I had a quick stay but felt the property was vibey and very clean. The instructions were super easy to follow despite being a few steps required to access the home. We parked right in front of the building and had no issues with the car overnight. I traveled with my 75 year-old dad and didn't realize there was such a steep stairway to enter the home, so I'd only recommend that you make sure all those traveling with you are mobile enough to climb the stairwell. He made it in fine, by the way! :)

There was a bit of an issue getting into the door but the host was responsive and we troubleshooted without a long wait time. Though I didn't get a chance to enjoy the rooftop, it looked dope! Would stay here again and would love more time to explore the neighborhood."
13561,441,"Thank you, Deloris! We enjoyed hosting you and would love to have you back again."
13562,441,"This place is nothing short of spectacular. If you want to access great restaurants a step away, or enjoy the vibrancy of downtown Durham from a rooftop, this is the place to stay."
13563,441,"Thanks, K Y! We enjoyed hosting you."
13564,441,"Great location and awesome condo to spend your time in Durham! Everything we wanted to experience was just a short walk away from this home. There is a construction project going on right near the condo, but we didn’t notice it whatsoever - no issues with noise. The private rooftop deck is also an awesome feature that sets this location apart! Will definitely try to snag this home again when we come back!"
13565,441,"Thanks Chris, we enjoyed hosting you!"
13566,441,Beautiful place!!!
13567,441,"Thank you, Alexis! We enjoyed hosting you."
13568,441,Slow response from host for access code to property.
13569,441,"We are disappointed in this 1-star review because it is surely not typical nor is it a reflection of our beautiful property or the guest's experience. We messaged Lauren her unique digital lock code to access the condo. Instead of reading the message, she replied in the exact same thread asking for the code, which had been messaged to her just above. We then referred her to it again, but she was upset she had not seen it sooner. We communicated our instructions as we always do, and just as is specified in the details of the listing."
13570,441,"lovely lovely location.

This place was not up to my cleanliness standard. A fair share of the furniture felt pretty wobbly/cheap.

The host was incredibly hard to reach when needed.

This is not someone's home on airbnb. This is a vacation rental being managed by a company."
13571,441,"We enjoyed hosting you, Hannah! We apologize for the delay in our response to your message."
13572,441,Loved our stay here! Was very walkable to downtown and Duke’s East Campus / ninth street area
13573,441,Thanks Chiara! Come back anytime.
13574,441,"Beautiful! stayed for a couple of days for a job orientation and loved it. Very clean, spacious and the view was very nice. I enjoyed my stay and look forward to the next."
13575,441,"Thanks Miguel, come back anytime!"
13576,441,The place was very clean and accurately described. The hosts were very responsive and helpful.
13577,441,"Thanks Dominick, we enjoyed hosting you!"
13578,441,"During our stay, we were over-whelmed by the smell of raw sewage, making the unit uninhabitable. So we booked a room at a nearby Marriott and left. We understand that units will have problems from time to time. What we do not understand is that Gino will only refund $125.00 out of total fee of $582.48. Gino seems more intent on keeping $457 then honoring his commitments. Future renters should be aware of this reality."
13579,441,"We enjoyed hosting your family members, Anne, and are sorry they did not enjoy their experience. To future guests reading this, we were unfortunately not notified of any issues until the day after the reservation had ended, after the guests were gone. If we would have been notified as soon as there was an issue, we could have been out there to address and solve the problem. Hearing about it after the fact, there was unfortunately not much we could do, though we did extend a partial refund as a kindness. This was a one-time maintenance issue, and is certainly not the norm, as you can see from all the other reviews of this beautiful suite."
13580,441,"The team at Pendleton were great! This was the second stay for members of my family. The unit is in a perfect location in downtown and easy to get to around. The team was also very helpful in allowing an extension of stay due to changes in flights over the Christmas due to weather.

We will book with them again for sure."
13581,441,Thanks so much!
13582,441,"LOVE this place. Definitely book here if you want a chic, roomy place right in the heart of Durham. Will definitely be back."
13583,441,"Appreciate it, see you next time your in town!"
13584,441,Great place - would recommend!
13585,441,"Appreciate it, see you next time your in town!"
13586,441,"Fantastic location and very comfortable place to relax. The bedroom did stay warmer than the rest of the place, even with the ceiling fan going. I ended up using a bedside fan, but I also like sleeping in an icebox. Even though it's right in a main area and there's construction across the street, it's a quiet place and there's a white noise machine to help at night."
13587,441,"Appreciate it, see you next time your in town!"
13588,441,"The pictures do not do it justice! The condo is beautifully renovated, comfortable and convenient. My husband and our adult daughter were in Durham for a wedding, with multiple downtown activities. This place was perfect! We had our own bedrooms and bathrooms and enjoyed hanging out in the living space. It was very clean and the kitchen more than met our needs. Highly recommend!"
13589,441,"Appreciate it, see you next time your in town!"
13590,441,"Perfect place in downtown Durham. Close to everything the region has to offer. Apartment is bright, spacious and spotless."
13591,441,"It was great to host you, Thomas! Come back anytime."
13592,441,"The stay was great! It's a beautiful place and it was in a great location. We were very excited to see they had noise machines, although the area ended up being quieter than we expected so we didn't need them to block out sounds from outside. Definitely would stay again the next time we are in Durham!"
13593,441,"It was wonderful to host you, Melinda! We look forward to having you back when you return to the area."
13594,441,Great stay! We will be back.
13595,441,"Thanks Maura, we look forward to hosting you again soon!"
13596,441,This place in Durham was amazing. The location couldn’t be beat and our group was comfortable with the entire space. The roof deck was a great spot to hang out after a long day and the entire unit was clean and provided the perfect amount of space for four adults. I highly recommend this spot for a stay in downtown Durham.
13597,441,"It was great to host you and your group, Nate! Come back and see us next time you're in town."
13598,441,Great place. Love how close it is to amazing restaurants and local shops. This is my second time staying here and it won’t be my last.
13599,441,"It was great to have you back, Isaiah, and we look forward to hosting you again when you're next in town!"
13600,441,Great location in heart of downtown Durham. everything was clean and comfortable for our weekend stay. I would stay here again.
13601,441,"We enjoyed hosting you, Sally! Come back anytime."
13602,441,"I used to live & work in Durham over a decade ago, so it was very fun to see how the downtown area has changed. Great location, lots of stuff within a quick walk. The apartment itself was lovely, very spacious. It was just me and my girlfriend on this trip, but I wouldn't hesitate to stay here with another couple. Hosts were very proactive and attentive. Would recommend them without hesitation."
13603,441,"It was wonderful to host you, Jordan! So glad you were able to return to the area, and we'd love to welcome you back when you visit again."
13604,441,"Comfortable, clean place to stay in downtown Durham. The owners provided all we needed for a lovely stay."
13605,441,"We enjoyed hosting you, Nancy! We'd love to have you back anytime."

13614,441,Wonderful spot!
13615,441,"Location, location, location!!!!"
13616,441,Location was great. Space was not clean. Mattresses are foam pads. Great rooftop deck but the furniture was cheap and not comfortable to enjoy. Broken glass since the string lights are on the ground. A few adjustments and this place could measure up to the listing.
13617,441,Great place!
13618,441,"Great stay all around! Awesome location, tons of space, and very quiet despite being right in the heart of downtown. The rooftop patio was a great touch."
13619,441,"We came here as 2 colleagues looking to do a bit of work together. The space was not just great for living, it was great for working in the open kitchen/dining/living plan too.

The space was thoughtfully appointed space and the location was great for short walks to a wide variety of great restaurants and bars.

In the evenings, it was surprisingly quiet when we stayed (though not completely) for being above a pizza restaurant (a really good one) and across from an active construction project.

Would highly recommend this airbnb and would definitely try and stay again!"
13620,441,"A very nice and clean location, right in the center of durham walking distance to everything (even have scooters right below if needed) the walls are not sound isolated so be aware of that loved the roof top and the team with thorough instructions for check in and check out i would recommend to others!"
13621,441,Great looking rental. Love the spacious rooms and the roof top deck is a great place to unwind!
13622,441,Excellent location and great space for gathering. Will stay again
13623,441,"Amazing value, location, and amount of space! The kitchen is particularly great. There are some sound isolation issues between rooms, but that wasn’t a big deal for us."
13624,441,Hope you sorted the wifi. Sorry i wasnt of help . Tks
13625,441,"Oh no! You pushed your private feedback in the public area! haha (this is what Roy sent in the private message) 'Great property. Probably best location un downtown Durham. Best places to eat are literally less than 500 ft from property (pizza Toro, M sushi, & Mothers & Sons) Highly recommend this property."""
13626,441,"This. Place. Is. Amazing. The location was perfect, the vibe was so awesome, and we loved the rooftop patio. We are already planning our next visit. Communication was wonderful and we loved our time there. My husband even said this is his favorite Airbnb yet!"
13627,441,"Wow, huge compliment. Thanks so much!"
13628,441,Awesome apartment right in the middle of everything but extremely quiet inside. Clean as can be. Roof top deck provides a nice view.
13629,441,Thanks so much Charles!
13630,441,"Hosts were excellent from start to finish. Very clean apartment, and easy to follow directions. Definitely recommend."
13631,441,"Appreciate the compliments Daniel, thanks so much!"

13637,441,Was great to have you!

What a fantastic base for us to visit colleges in NC. Amazing coffee shop across the street along with yummy other restaurants. Gorgeous run to Duke if you are a runner. Would definitely stay again."
13639,441,Was great to have you!
13640,441,"This has been one of the best Airbnb’s I’ve stayed in so far! The location couldn’t of been better. I was right downtown with great bars and restaurants all in walking distance from the place. The condo itself had everything I could need and more, plus the hosts included such lovely details to make my stay even more special. I will definitely be booking this place again the next time I am in Durham!!"
13641,441,Thank you for the big compliment!
13642,446,Good place to stay

13645,446,"If you are looking for a fun, unusual camping adventure in the mountains, this place it great. It has a small hot tub and a privacy fence. It is close to downtown Ashville too."
13646,446,This place was a very unique experience and overall extremely enjoyable!
13647,446,Lovely place and overall happy with my stay.
13648,446,We absolutely loved our weekend. The bus was amazing. Christine and her team thought of everything. Thank you for hosting us. Highest of recommends…
13649,446,Very peaceful and cozy. Ceiling was little short for someone my size (6’4) but great for our short stay.
13650,446,Great little place to stay! Everything was great.
13651,446,"Very quick on answering any questions. Such a neat and unique place to stay—close to downtown, but also far enough away to enjoy the evenings/nights in the hot tub."
13652,446,This was a really neat place to stay
13653,446,"This place was great !!! very unique & private.
the only problem we had was the hot tub didn’t stay warm. overall a great experience !"
13654,446,Had a great time!!!
13655,446,What a wonderful little get away! Great location and such a unique lovely bus! Everything you need.
13656,466,"Great house, clean, updated, nice furniture, well stocked kitchen, very comfortable beds."
13657,466,"We enjoyed a quiet, peaceful night on Harker’s Island. The location of the house is close to the Waterfowl Museum and ferry. Nice view of the water and enough space for a few guests."
13658,466,Quiet restful spot surrounded by nature. Fabulous Christmas decorations on the island were a bonus. Host responded quickly to our needs.
13659,466,Amy's house is the place to stay in Harkers Island. Better than the description and what was in the photos. Our group of 4 had plenty of room and it was right next to the cape lookout ferry and visitors center. A++++++ I would stay here again!
13660,466,Beautiful house. With a beautiful view. Fully stocked with everything you need and very clean. We will be back 😊
13661,466,"Highly recommend!!! Cannot say enough about how great this place is! Spacious inside, lots of outdoor space for playing or just relaxing, super clean, and kitchen was amazing!!!!!
Walking distance from where you take the ferry to Cape Lookout which has an amazing light house.
People in the neighborhood are very friendly!!!! Thanksgiving was made super special by staying at this house!!!"
13662,466,"the place was perfect, everything easily available. spacious, quiet, good view, we will be returning for sure"
13663,466,Great second stay! Wonderful location! Amy is always incredibly accommodating.
13664,466,"Great house, very nicely done and the host was super. Will rent again"
13665,466,"Beautiful home and so well stocked. We took advantage of the nearby ferry to Cape Outlook, and coming home to Amy's place was wonderful. One of the nicest places we've had the pleasure of staying at through Airbnb."
13666,466,Amy’s house had everything you could possibly need for your stay plus more! The location was perfect and very close to the ferry.
13667,466,"This is an amazing AirBnB. It has everything you could hope for, and plenty of things that were a happy, welcome surprise. Location is fantastic and the owners were very nice, helpful, and knowledgeable about the area."
13668,466,Great place. The house is very clean and well equipped. Amy was very responsive and easy to communicate with.
13669,466,"We had a wonderful time, even though Hurricane Ian was passing through the state! Amy was great to work with. She communicated easily and was very helpful with the few questions we had. The house is lovely: Clean, bright, well equipped, and the beds are especially comfortable! Lots of games and movies, a beautiful screen porch, and more!
The house is less than a mile from the Island Ferry dock, which is perfect for anyone hoping to go shelling to Shackleford Banks and Cape Lookout. If you go, splurge on the UTV (4-wheel drive vehicle) because it gets you to the point quicker where the good shells are!! Lots of souvenirs, tshirts, etc at the Seaview shop, and plenty of restaurants in nearby Beaufort. I also highly recommend Reel Tangled Charters for a shelling or fishing excursion.....Capt. Steve was great! Charming house, great getaway, great hosts! We'll be back!"
13670,466,"The house is beautifully decorated, well organized, and very clean. We would definitely stay again. Absolutely loved the Harkers Island. Host is very helpful and quick to respond."
13671,466,"We had a wonderful experience at Amy’s place. The house was impeccably clean and newly remodeled and designed. Really comfortable to relax in. All the furniture, appliances, linens and kitchen tools were nice and new, so you have everything you need and can stay awhile. We love this more remote location because we like to take the passenger ferry to the national seashore to enjoy the most beautiful, undeveloped beaches in America. I would stay at Amy’s place again and recommend it to a friend."
13672,466,Our stay was amazing from check in- check out. Everything that's we needed was there and it was a great set-up!
13673,466,This place was honestly great for the price. Had everything you need to make it feel like a home away from home when on vacation.
13674,466,Thank you Amy for all of the extras. Thank you for communicating with us and helping us stay the extra night. Your place is beautiful and you do a fabulous job!
13675,466,"Amy’s place is fantastic. Just a short ride by bike or car to the ferry. All of the amenities you could want. Clean, comfortable and cozy. Would definitely recommend for anyone making a trip to the Outer Banks!"
13676,466,Beautifully decorated home with quiet water view. Home is clean and well stocked. Really enjoyed our stay with close proximity to cape lookout ferry. Amy provided great communication and home was clean and well maintained.
13677,466,Great location to the visitors center and ferry! Amy is wonderful at communicating and the house was perfect.
13678,466,The perfect spot to relax! It has absolutely everything you need and Amy was a perfect host - super quick to respond to any communication and beyond helpful. I cannot wait to stay here again!
13679,466,HAD A GREAT TIME WITH MY FAMILY. SPACIOUS STOCKED WITH EVERYTHING YOU COULD NEED. BEAUTIFULLY DECORATED THE BEDS SLEPT WONDERFUL( TO SAY THE LEAST THE BEST BEDS I HAVE EVER SLEPT IN). I WOULD NOT HAVE A PROBLEM STAYING THERE AGAIN. A VERY QUIET AND LOVELY HOME. AA+
13680,466,"Amy’s property was the perfect place for a relaxing vacation and anniversary trip. The location was close to Shackleford Banks which was the perfect island get away! The property was clean, well- stocked, and spacious for our family of 6! Thank you Amy !!"
13681,466,"The beds were very comfortable (which is oh so important), the amenities were even better than described, and the hot water nwver ran out with shower after shower when back from the beach."
13682,466,"This is house was beautiful and Amy was amazing! Always willing to help with any questions. Great location, we woke every morning and were able to see the wild ponies. Just breathtaking!"
13683,466,Amy's Place is the best beach rental at which we have stayed! The house is perfectly laid out for a family with comfortable beds and pillows in every room. The amenities provided are top notch with amazing unexpected extras. The kitchen is stocked with everything you need. Amy was a perfect host! In addition to all that... the house is gorgeously decorated!
13684,466,"This is a terrific location on Harkers Island. We had a very relaxing vacation enjoying the views and comfort of the home. Amy’s place was immaculately clean and well stocked. The beds were very comfortable and all the kitchen appliances were new and of high quality.

Amy gets extra points for, when told we were bringing a toddler, rolling out the red carpet for our daughter. There was a high chair, along with age appropriate utensils.

You can expect great communication from the hosts, too—Amy responded promptly answering any questions that came up.

If you’re looking to stay in the Harkers Island area, look no further.

Finally, if you have never stayed on or been to Harkers Island, you might wonder if it’s for you. It’s true that there are not a ton of shopping or dining options nearby (though check out Shark Island food truck! It’s great… and Billy’s has most any grocery item you’d need). But in exchange you get seclusion, privacy, and a peaceful place to vacation.

This house would be the perfect place to experience the island for the first time."
13685,466,"Quaint, clean and just 30 minutes from historic Beaufort! Amy was so sweet on top of it! Thank you!!"
13686,466,"Loved our stay at Amy’s place. The most well stocked Airbnb we have ever been in. The house is very clean with everything you need for a wonderful stay. The neighborhood is so safe and friendly. We will definitely be back, hopefully very soon. Thanks for a great stay."
13687,466,"Amy is the ultimate super host! She was so kind and generous, ensuring we had everything we needed for our stay. 10/10- highly recommend this spot! It’s the perfect beach getaway. A relaxing spot that makes you feel right at home. We will definitely be returning!"
13688,466,"We were looking for a place to stay as a family when in the area for a wedding. We had a wonderful time at Harker's Island, and this house was exactly what we were looking for. It was great to relax with our adult kids and their spouses and enjoy time together. Though we weren't there long, we were able to settle in quickly, and it was cozy and comfortable. Everything was clean and in great shape to use. The coffee and hot drink choices with the Keurig were very much appreciated! My husband and daughter-in-law enjoyed a bike ride to explore the nearby park on the sound soon after we arrived and loved the bikes! The screened in deck was awesome, and we all enjoyed sitting out there several times for meals, or just to sit and chat in the evening. It was so quiet and peaceful, and the view of the sound was pleasant as well. We ordered out to the Fishhook Grill, and the food and service were great. We also drove over to Atlantic Beach and enjoyed an afternoon there... thanks for making beach towels available!

Amy was quick to respond to any questions and was very helpful whenever we contacted her. We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay there again if we are in the area! Harker's Island is a little off the beaten track, but for us was a perfect, quiet, peaceful place to get away.


Bob & Carol"
13689,466,The house was everything advertised and then some! Amy and Josh were both very nice and helpful! The house was clean and had very nice amenities. I have nothing negative to say. I would 100% recommend this place to anyone and we will definitely be back!
13690,466,"Amy’s bnb was the best place I’ve ever stayed at the beach! She was so welcoming and gave me lots of suggestions on places to visit both nearby and a little drive or ferry ride away. She was extremely accommodating, having a high chair and other baby items for our 2 babies. We loved her house-the art, screened in porch and especially the hammock! Hope we can visit again!"
13691,466,"Amy’s place is fantastic- perfectly clean, more well-stocked than my kitchen at home, comfortable beds, inviting layout, great location. And Amy was super available and helpful with suggestions. We will be back for sure."
13692,466,"Jeannine, you were the perfect first guests. Come back soon!"
13693,474,"Such a beautiful space, recently renovated, every detail about the space was well-considered and clean. I would stay there again!"
13694,474,"It is my second time staying at Inna's, and it was as great as the first time. Inna is very accommodating and super responsive. Great host and a great space. Thanks so much, Inna!"
13695,474,"A really nice place. New, comfortable, and clean. Had everything I needed and nothing I didn’t. A block from the multi use path. Inna is friendly and accommodating. She let me know the place was available early for check in. I would certainly stay again."
13696,474,"Inna was fantastic. We let her know we were arriving late at night and she left the lights on. With the keypad we were easily able to let ourselves in and enjoy a great nights sleep after a very long day of driving. The entire place was immaculate and very well equipped.

Jack and Carmen Merriam"
13697,474,I loved staying at Inna's Inn! It is setup and furnished excellently. I can take a quick walk to watch the sunset over the sound or cross the street/beach road to watch the sunrise over the ocean. Inna is responsive and considerate. Would definitely stay again!
13698,474,This is a great find! Will be coming back! Inna is an amazing host!
13699,474,We absolutely loved staying at Inna’s Inn! My fiancé & puppy enjoyed our weekend. The room was extremely clean and I loved the decor!

Don’t miss the sunset!
13700,474,"Inna was incredibly responsive even though she herself was out of the area at the time of my stay. When an issue arose she had it resolved within minutes. She was incredibly flexible and friendly. Thanks so much, Inna!"
13701,474,Such a nice and relaxing place for a get away!
13702,474,"This place was clean, simple and exactly what we needed."

13708,474,"What a great spot! Clean and bright, close to everything. Nice quiet neighborhood to walk our dog, and a 1/2 block to the multi-use trail along Currituck Sound. We walked to the beach every morning and saw dolphins and maybe whales. We biked to the Wright Brothers Memorial. Inna was very helpful and quick to respond. We would definitely stay here again!"
13709,474,"What an AWESOME place! Inna was a fantastic host and her cozy and super clean place was perfect for my hubby and I and our pups. They loved the walks near the sound and running in the fenced yard.

Inna had the perfect touches to make the stay outstanding….soft bedding, nice (and great smelling) towels, and even extra make up removers/hair ties/shampoo, etc. She was a great host and super responsive. Highly, highly recommend!"
13710,474,"This was a really nice little place, adorable little apartment and perfect space for me, my kid, and my dog. Little hard space, swings, cozy string lights outside… I was bit blown away by how the outer banks felt. But kill Devil hills has a lot in it as well… i need to come back with my boyfriend to see what else we can find."
13711,474,Nice location and space for my stay!
13712,474,"Wonderful place to stay. Close to the beach and in quite neighborhood. The unit is stylish, clean and cozy. Easy check in and friendly host."

13714,474,"This was a great place for our first weekend in the Outer Banks! The place is clean, has everything you need and it’s in a great location!
Backyard is great for bringing your pup, just know it’s not totally fenced in."
13715,474,"Fantastic spot. Enjoyable for the humans as well as the pup!

13720,474,We had such a great time in the Outer Banks and Inna’s Inn was perfect for my husband and I and our two pups. The yard was great for potty breaks when we were back and the outdoor shower was nice to also get the dogs clean after the beach! Communication was amazing and very quick! Lovely place and we would come again if we make it to the Outer Banks again!!
13721,474,"Inna is a great host. Very friendly, easy to communicate with and overall a cool person. The location is amazing right by the paved path on the sound- Perfect for cruising to the sunset. The inside is super clean and smells great. Very cozy would absolutely love to stay again."

13726,474,Inna’s place was perfect for a short little stay. The place was very clean and it had everything we needed. I was impressed that her place had central a/c which is much appreciated in this summer heat. Our dog loved the nice and green back yard and we all enjoyed taking walks on the bike path close by. Her place is ground level and parking is covered. Perfect!
13727,474,Absolutely perfect for our one night stay!! Clean and such cute decor. Will be back!
13728,474,Inna was very responsive and a great host! The place was clean and located in a great part of town.

It was very clean and perfect to bring our dog along to- she has a fenced yard! Inna was very friendly and made us feel right at home. We would stay again!"
13733,474,Just a lovely room for a couple of single. Great decor and also quiet! Will be back.
13734,474,"Our trip was great. Inna was super accommodating, the beach and bay were walking distance, and our dogs loved the yard! Sad we are home but will be back next year. Thank you!!"
13735,474,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay at Inna's. Her thoughtful touches with extra hair ties, cotton wipes, make up remover wipes, shampoo/conditioner/bodywash, were sweet. As noted in other reviews, just keep in mind the sound proofing is not the best and bring a fluffy pillow if that's what you're used to sleeping on."
13736,474,This is the perfect place to come and relax! The outdoor area was my favorite with the hammock and furniture and the yard for my dog! Everything was so clean and comfortable and I would definitely come back! Inna was so sweet and welcoming to me and my puppy Delilah!
13737,474,Highly recommend Inna’s place! It was located really well between the beach and the water park and the room was incredibly clean. Check in was easy and everything looked exactly like the pictures. A great place to stay overall!
13738,474,Beautiful apartment! Clean and well-equipped. Close to the sound. Very nice host!
13739,474,"Inna’s place is so stylish, comfortable, clean, and convenient to everything you might want to do in Nags Head. It’s also in a quiet, walkable neighborhood. Perfect for a couple or small family with a dog. We brought our little one and our fur baby and it felt like plenty of space. We felt right at home—so relaxing! We will definitely stay again."
13740,474,"Great location, very clean new space. Would definitely recommend!"
13741,474,Lovely place to stay and close to the beach. Inna was very friendly and accommodating of our dog. The place is closer to the bay side of the island but it is very easy to get to the beach. Would definitely stay here again!
13742,474,"Inna’s place was clean, modern, and close to the beach. No regrets!"
13743,474,"Had a great time with my husband and dogs. Inna was very accommodating. Nice quiet neighborhood with long multi-use path along the sound. Great for walking our dogs. The fenced-in yard didn’t have a gate, so we didn’t feel comfortable letting our dogs run without leash, but we took them on walks instead, not a big deal. Lots of basics stocked in the pantry and bathroom to help make the most of the space! I would definitely recommend to others!"
13744,474,Great place and location. Excellent dog friendly stay including a fenced in backyard. Steps from the multi-use path on the sound. Inna is pleasant and great communicating. Pictures are accurate and the outside space was lovely to relax during the midday heat. We would definitely stay again/recommend!
13745,474,Great location in a beautiful place!
13746,474,Inna’s place is exactly as pictured/described. Communication was great and checking in and out was easy-peasy. Inna kindly left the light on for us when we were gone after dark. The home is also near a great neighborhood paved pathway that we used to go running. Would definitely stay here again!
13747,474,"Inna is a fantastic host & her place had everything we needed and more. We used the hot plate several times for cooking breakfast. The beach chairs were also very helpful for our beach days. The fenced in backyard was wonderful for our dog as we were able to get out and toss the ball around with her. The location is just up the street from the sound and absolutely gorgeous sunsets! You are also close to ocean beach access. Also, you’re right in the middle between Nags Head and Southern Shores/Duck allowing for an easy drive in either direction. We spent a week here and it was a wonderful stay!"
13748,474,"Everything was exactly as described (or better!) The guest apartment is very clean. Everything is new and fresh and nicely decorated. Bed is comfortable. We arrived on a 90 degree day in May and the AC was already on, so we walked in to a comfortable room -- very considerate! We were able to sit outside in the 2 Adirondack chairs and enjoy the breeze in the shaded area under the house. The location, which is only a block away from the Sound, was great for taking leisurely strolls along the water! Highly recommend and hope we can come back again."
13749,474,"We LOVED staying at Inna’s! It was the perfect one bed, one bath, pet friendly stay. We hope to come back soon!"
13750,474,Great house! Great location! Great host!
13751,474,"Hands down the best kept Air BNB that we have stayed at. Perfect for my boyfriend and I, plus our fur baby! Inna was extremely communicative and friendly. We had everything we needed there plus a wonderful neighborhood with quick access to the sound. We will definitely book again!"
13752,474,Great spot! We booked Inna’s for our first anniversary. Inna was super communicative. The place was beautiful and spotless!
13753,474,Great weekend get away!
13754,474,We had a wonderful time at Inna’s! The road the house is on takes you to the sound in just a few minutes via walking. Lovely home. Had everything we wanted and needed! Highly recommend.
13755,474,"Excellent Airbnb! The host is very friendly and accommodating. The place is clean, cozy and in a great location! Would definitely recommend it!"
13756,474,"This is a great little place. Super clean and everything you need. Off street parking, easy check in. Half block from a multi-use path along the Sound. And a 5 minute drive from the beach. Lots of great restaurants close by."
13757,474,"This Airbnb was the perfect weekend get-away! We were two adults and a small dog, but the space was bright, clean, and sizable. You are within an easy 10-minute walk to a fabulous, local coffee shop. Or stay in and brew your own with the coffee maker that Inna provided. Just down the street is a wide multi-use path, perfect for a sunset stroll for exploring the neighborhood. It was a bit chilly for water fun; temps during our stay were a breezy high 50s to low 60s, but we are already planning a second trip to take advantage of warmer weather! We highly recommend Inna’s for your Airbnb stay to OBX!"
13758,474,"Inna and her property were great! She handled issues quickly and kept us informed. Space was great us, 2 adults, 2 dogs, and a 9 month old. The outdoor space was lovely and it was a short walk to the beautiful sunsets! Would stay with Inna again."
13759,474,Great stay! Love the area. Would recommend
13760,474,"Inna’s Inn is a lovely spot in a perfect location at OBX. We had a great stay and hope to come back again soon. Very cozy, clean and stylish space."
13761,474,Such a great place to stay
13762,474,"Quiet neighborhood, quick access to beaches and very helpful host!"
13763,474,"This was the perfect spot for a quick getaway. The apt. was super clean and cozy! Great location - close to the sound and not too far from the beach, also located very close to various restaurants. Would def. stay here again !"
13764,474,We were not able to make our reservation due to weather and Inna was understanding
13765,474,"Amazing stay... except that you can hear E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G going on upstairs in the downstairs apartment and it can be quite loud. The location was perfect and super convenient. The apartment was absolutely adorable and immaculately clean. Loved that it was dog friendly, had a fenced backyard, and was a fantastic neighborhood to walk in... the sunset views looking across the bay were gorgeous! Having covered parking right by the door was fantastic too since I don't travel light and it was raining when I left. It was great to not have to walk far or get wet! With some sound proofing this place would be perfect."
13766,474,"Inna’s place is tidy, cute, and easy to access! It’s very dog friendly in a nice neighborhood for walking, and close to everything you’d want access to in OBX. Would definitely recommend!"
13767,474,Great location and very clean! Came during Christmas and still lots to see and do during the holiday break around the area. Would recommend for proximity alone
13768,474,"Great place for my husband and I and our dog to stay! It was a clean and modern space that we would stay at again when visiting the Outer Banks area. We also enjoyed that it was close to restaurants, coffee shops and the beach."
13769,474,"Inna is the BEST host! This air bnb was perfect for myself, my boyfriend, and our two dogs. The location was amazing and the home was well-stocked with necessities. We will absolutely be back!"
13770,481,wonderful stay1
13771,481,"We enjoyed our stay. The only thing that lacked was hot water for a shower. We had six people, so after 3 showers, the hot water was lacking. Other than that, the place was very clean, free wine and coffee was available, and the bedrooms were all nice and comfortable. Good location."
13772,481,Hi Beth! Thank you for a great review! We will take a look at the water heater to make some adjustments on the temperature. We tried this at my home at it worked great.
13773,481,Super ok 👌 thank
13774,481,Thank you Nicholae for your review! Please visit us again!1
13775,481,I stayed here for my 26th birthday weekend! My guest & I loved this place! The place looks just like the pictures. When I come back I will definitely be booking.
13776,481,Great
13777,481,Thanks the stag was great!
13778,481,Derrick's place made our stay superb for my Niece's Graduation. It was a party of 6 and plenty of space. Open floor plan in a modern home. Response right away. Great away from home property.
13779,481,Great property! Great host! Super clean and perfect space for our family for Thanksgiving.
13780,481,"The house was cleaned, smelled great, and very well put together. The jetted tub was not working upon our arrival and was not able to be fixed. Be aware that there is a car (silver jaguar) parked under the metal awning in the back so it will take up 1 covered parking space if you bring two cars. We enjoyed our stay and are hoping to stay again to see any improvements that may have been made."
13781,481,Hi Hope! Thank you for your review and we would love to host you all again. Bubble Bath will be on us! Safe travels!
13782,481,My friends and I stayed at this home this past weekend and it was PERFECT. Very clean and stocked with everything we need. I would absolutely stay here again.
13783,481,"Thanks Brooke for allowing us to host you! We take pride in providing a clean, comfortable and cozy place for our guest to enjoy. We love all the little things when we book places as well! See you next year!"
13784,481,"Even nicer than pictured! This was the perfect house for my family to stay in for my wedding weekend. We loved our stay, the quietness of the neighborhood, and the top notch communication from the hosts! 10/10 recommend"
13785,481,It was a n honor to host you on such a special occasion! Congratulations and please come again for your next big occasion!
13786,481,This house was perfect for our needs. The hosts were great and we were well provided for. Location was great and it was very clean!
13787,481,Thank you Kasey for your review! It was a pleasure hosting and we take a lot of pride in the service we give our guests. We want you to enjoy the home as much as we do!
13788,481,"Derrick and Kim are excellent hosts, we enjoyed our stay. They have a great house that’s very well furnished and is located in a very quiet neighborhood. Highly recommended!"
13789,481,Hi Stratimir! We enjoyed having you and the family staying in our home. I am happy we were able to extend your stay! Please come again... Plus one little one! Safe travels!
13790,481,"It is the first time that I have used Airbnb. Let me compliment you on the accommodations. We enjoyed it very much, and would not hesitate to recommend this service to a friend. Keep up the good work."
13791,481,"Great host, house was perfect for what we needed and so clean! Would stay again if ever back in the area!"
13792,481,Nice place
13793,481,"Great place to stay, clean room. Quite neighborhood. Friendly hosts"
13794,481,"Derrick was an awesome host! He responded very quickly to any questions we had, and was very accommodating to our needs/requests. He even suggested restaurants in the area for us to check out. Check-in/out instructions were super detailed and helpful. 
The house has been remodeled recently and the modern decor matched our style perfectly. It was very clean and well-stocked making for a very comfortable stay. We could not have asked for a better location, being close to the campus and downtown. Overall a wonderful place and we would definitely stay here again when we are back in the area. Five stars all the way!!!"
13795,481,"We had an awesome stay. The beautiful house was clean, quiet and located in a great area. Derrick was great and easy to communicate with. We will definitely be staying here again soon."
13796,481,This place is a home away from home. Clean and bright and very comfortable. Owners were always a call and text away. Revolution Mill is a place to check out.
13797,481,Loved the place! It’s beautiful and clean!
13798,481,"Absolutely lovely home that is conveniently close to several area attractions. The hosts provided everything we could possibly need.
The snack bar is such a nice touch. Will definitely stay again when in the area."
13799,481,Nice place with good amenities
13800,481,"This home was lovely, fresh and well equipped. It was exactly as described and the pictures were accurate. All of the furniture was very comfortable as were the beds. The neighborhood was nice, quiet and very convenient!"
13801,481,"If you’re looking to stay in the area, book this airbnb! Its comfortable, modern and super clean! Two of the rooms have their own restroom/shower, which worked great for our group. If I were to come back to the area, I’d definitely stay here again!"
13802,481,Everything was great and as described. Derrick and Kim are easy to message with. Comfortable home in a nice area.
13803,481,Great location and home! Derrick was very responsive. We would recommend this home in heartbeat. Our only regret was that we didn’t know about this gem when our daughter was a freshman!
13804,481,"The listing accurately depicts the property. Having 4 bedrooms each with queen beds and two having their own bathroom was a huge draw for our group as well as the fact that dogs are allowed. I am always thankful when hosts allow pets to come along as I cannot leave my aging dog with anyone.
We were in NC for HPU graduation so it was about half hour drive to most of our destinations in High Point but very close to many good restaurants and shops in Greensboro.
We never cooked in the kitchen but it seemed to be set up well and I agree with other reviews that the towels are nice but, if you are staying with many people for a few nights you may need more towels or, you could wash them yourself to use again.
The only things I would mention for anyone considering renting is that the bed in the master bedroom is pretty high off the ground-totally fine for some people but may be hard for anyone with mobility issues. Also, the yard is not well lit so if you are walking a dog in the darker hours you need your phone as a flashlight. There is landscape lighting but it isn't helpful to see the yard. No deal breakers, just something to think about depending on your situation!
We had 6 adults comfortably in the home, I would book again if I needed a space for a larger group to stay."
13805,481,We stay just for one night and it couldn’t be more perfect. The place is extremely clean and it has everything you need. Derrick absolute has snacks and wine for us. I will recommend this place 100%
13806,481,beautiful house in nice neighborhood
13807,481,This home was a true gem. The spa bathroom and wine bar were a great touch. The hosts responded very quickly and were also a pleasure. I will be booking again in the future. My family was truly satisfied.
13808,481,"Fantastic location everything was about 5-10 min drive. Pictures on website are spot on, great house. We would definitely stay here again!"
13809,481,"Great hosts and home. Clean and well decorated. Would definitely stay again when in town, such a lovely home."
13810,481,Derrick and Kim have a lovely home! Just as beautiful as the pictures and quite spacious. The space was immaculately clean and decorated so nicely. The towels and sheets were super soft. Derrick and Kim are also highly accommodating to their guests which is greatly appreciated. We look forward to booking again when in Greensboro! Book now!
13811,481,"We enjoyed our stay, the place was very clean and nicely decorated. Very comfortable for 4 couples, convenient location and quiet neighborhood."
13812,481,Great space with all the little things to make our stay comfortable! The location was perfect for our needs. Great parking. Close to stores and restaurants. Great communication with Hosts.
13813,481,Fantastic for a robotics team in need of a fabulous team bonding spot before states
13814,481,Derrick was a great host!!! Great communication and the home was in great condition. Everything was very clean and exactly as advertised!!! Would definitely stay again!
13815,481,Very clean Airbnb! Everything was exactly as advertised. Great spot for a quick getaway in Greensboro
13816,481,Very nice home! We will be staying again!
13817,481,"Great place, great location, spacious, and was able to accommodate all our needs. Would highly recommend to whoever is looking for a place to stay in the Greensboro area."
13818,481,"This is a great property. Everything was super clean, 10 - 15 from everything you can think of and the hosts were extremely hospitable.
10/10 would come back again!"
13819,481,"Great, recently renovated home that was perfect for our group of friends. Would certainly stay again!"
13820,481,The house is so beautifully decorated and there are a lot of simple details that give the house a luxurious vibe. The hosts are very responsive and left complimentary snacks for us!
13821,481,Clean. Roomy. Good parking. Host was easy to communicate with and got back with us quickly.
13822,481,One of the best houses probably the best I’ve stayed in thus far I didn’t break any rules just nosey neighbors only problem
13823,481,As advertised! Great location and great host
13824,481,Need more towels and washcloths for up to 8 people. Trash should be emptied upon the next travelers stay.
13825,481,"Thank you for your review! If you are ever in need of more linens just let us know and we would be happy to accommodate you! We were not aware you needed anything. Trash is collected once per week. With multiple check-ins, there may be trash from a previous guest in the large outside bin. Due to your gathering, there was a lot of trash accumulated by the guest you booked for. If there is anything you need while staying with us please just let us know. It is very important to us for our guest to be accommodated during their stay."
13826,481,House is nice and clean. Enjoyed my stay
13827,481,A wonderful property and location. Derrick was an amazing host. I highly recommend a stay here the home is well appointed and extremely comfortable. Definitely on my favorites to stay at again.
13828,481,Location is quiet as mention it had a warm an clean vibe to it thought it was very nice touch that the host had great selection of snacks when checking in-we ate all the popcorn! Great communication an quick responses recommend it.
13829,481,"This place is definitely one to keep. When you roll up from the outside you’ll feel like what have I booked? Punch in your code and open the door and everything changes. Kick off your shoes, relax your feet, and enjoy your stay. A real jewel!"
13830,482,"My stay at this Airbnb was fantastic -- it was an extremely well-designed and beautifully decorated space that was perfect for my needs. It was very well-appointed, with some lovely touches I'd never seen at other Airbnbs. I felt really comfortable and cozy in this place and loved how walkable it was to Downtown Davidson and the greenways. Communication was excellent and I'd definitely return in the future."
13831,482,"I have nothing but wonderful things to say about this home and the hosts! The home was beautiful, extremely clean and had anything you probably forgot at home (like I did). The hosts were responsive, accommodating and very friendly! Five stars! I will definitely stay here again when I come to the area :)"
13832,482,Great location and lovey hosts. We felt like we had everything we needed which was super important when traveling with an infant.
13833,482,"Not Enough Stars to Properly Rate!

Somehow five feels insufficient. Anyone looking for a super cute, laid-back town…Davidson.

However… if you’re looking for a memorable experience in said town. stay at Rachelle and Brent’s.
Clear, precise, and punctual communication.
Clean, excellent interior design (so many little touches), perfect use of space.

My partner and I will keep returning bc it feels like home."
13834,482,A wonderful Airbnb. Very clean and had all the essentials you need. Would definitely stay again. Great location in a very quaint town.
13835,482,"Super location. Enjoyed our walks thru beautiful residential neighborhoods and charming college town only steps from property.
Quick access to beautiful Lake Norman and I-77 for exploring region. Great time!"
13836,482,A perfect spot ! Love it here.
13837,482,"Great location, very clean, great value!!"
13838,482,"My wife and I had the opportunity to stay at Rachelle and Brent's loft for 10 days. It was such a nice treat! The layout is impressive and no space is wasted. I worked full days throughout our stay and was able to be as productive as when I'm at my home office. The entire space is brand new, clean, and the design was beautiful with a peaceful vibe. The bed, couch, dining table, and desk space were all comfortable. The loft has a full kitchen so we were able to eat a lot of meals ""at home"", though we did take the opportunity to walk Davidson and eat dinner out often. 5 stars across the board for this amazing space and for Rachelle and Brent, who were really great to talk to."
13839,482,The loft was perfect with everything I needed for a week stay. The area is quite and within walking distances to the town and college. Davidson is bike friendly which I took advantage of daily. Rachelle was great with just the perfect amount of communication. I would stay here again on my next trip to Charlotte.
13840,482,"Overall, loved it! loved the location to the college and Main Street for running back and forth, really appreciated the snacks and suggestions left in the house. We told lots of our friends who have children in the area so I hope you can gain some more business for such a well-done renovation. keep an eye on reunion and move-in and move-out weekends at the school and you could have a great marketing opportunity (not sure how but maybe the school could help with private listings?). most people only think hotels are the option.
thanks again for the clarity of everything and for doing all that the rental promised! if you ever need a recommendation, we will gladly give it. Thanks! Sara"
13841,482,Great spot . Easy walking distance to Davidson to see our son. Would recommend !
13842,482,"This place was wonderful! So comfortable and clean! Had everything you could need. Was beautifully done, and everything was simple and easy! I highly recommend these hosts!"
13843,482,I had a wonderful stay in Rachelle's loft. It was comfortable and inviting and exactly as described. The location is convenient to the college. I will definitely stay again when visiting Davidson.
13844,482,"Nicely decorated, convenient place to stay!
The blackout blinds are a nice touch as well."
13845,482,"We loved this place! Gorgeous loft, clean, modern, convenient to town. The hosts were wonderful and kind. We will definitely stay here again when we are in town."
13846,482,Excellent space for two! Clean and comfortable! Highly recommend!
13847,482,Fantastic carriage house apartment. Nicely decorated with all updated ammenities! Very comfortable and great location. Will stay here again when visiting Davidson!
13848,482,"Absolutely one of the best Airbnb stays yet. I love Davidson, NC and the apartment was so convenient. Clean. Brand new. Plenty of nice touches."
13849,482,"You can expect everything to be exactly as they stated and then some. The personal touches (tiny hearts/color scheme/products/furniture comfort-level/local guide book) made all the difference in the world. Heck, one could live in that bathroom alone and be a content being! They truly set a high bar for all other AirBNB’s out there. This place is a must book."
13850,482,"Rachelle’s place is comfortable, beautifully decorated and was outfitted with everything I needed. I would highly recommend it."
13851,482,"We found Rachelle to be an amazing host, available and extremely accommodating. Our stay at her airbnb made us feel like we were at home away from home. We had everything we needed, and the apartment was clean, pretty, private, and filled with natural light. It was perfect ! Thank you, Rachelle !"
13852,482,We loved it so much the first time we came back again!
13853,482,Great hosts! Very comfortable space! Fantastic natural light and high ceilings. Really enjoyable stay!
13854,482,"Rachelle is so nice! The place was conveniently located and easy to access. She responded to my messages quickly if I ever needed anything and made sure I had whatever I needed for my stay. The bed was super comfortable - I forgot my pillow at home and was worried. No need to worry about comfort here at all. Also, the town is super cute. It looks like something out of a hallmark movie."
13855,482,This place is lovely - the kitchen is beautiful! Rachelle is welcoming and communicative. The location is great to walk to town and take in some of the local restaurants!
13856,482,Great open living space.
13857,482,"This is the private feedback from Katye. I think it was meant to be included here. : )

""Adorable loft in a nice location. Close to Davison's Main Street. Super clean with very helpful hosts!""

Thank you Katye!"
13858,482,"Think about every AirBnB you’ve ever rented. Or hotel you've stayed in. Now try to remember those little things you felt were missing. ""If only..."" Whatever you might have wished for in those rentals, this one has it already. Rachelle and Brent have thought of every little detail and created the perfect AirBnB rental.

This impeccably clean, quiet, and well appointed loft above the owner's garage offers guests all the privacy of a secluded house rental, but right in the heart of a residential neighborhood. Just steps from Main Street, it an easy walk to the heart of Davidson with it's selection of cafes, shops and restaurants. Parents or others coming to visit the Davidson College would find this flat to be the absolute perfect ""home base"" no matter how long or short the trip. Assuming you have a car, you're also right on the border with Cornelius which has its own assortment of entertainment and dining, and of course there's Lake Norman to explore. Interstate 77 is super close for those needing access to Charlotte.

Rachelle and Brent and their two dogs are perfect hosts. (The dogs are fenced in so no worry there, but they are also very friendly and we enjoyed greeting them on our way in and out of the flat.) Rachelle could teach a Masterclass on how to design and run an AirBnB. There are not enough superlatives for me to express how impressed my wife and I were with this rental.

Five stars!!"
13859,482,"WOW!
Thank you, Bill, for taking the time to write such a thoughtful and detailed review. We are so appreciative of your efforts. This has to be one of the most comprehensive and glowing reviews we have read on Airbnb. We are so grateful and honored that it is written about our property. You and Ksenia were a pleasure to host and we hope to connect again when you are back in town. Thanks again!"
13860,482,This is the perfect stay! Rachelle made sure that we had everything we needed during our stay and more. I would highly recommend this lovely abode to anyone!
13861,482,"Rachelle's place is gorgeous and absolutely perfect. It had all of the necessary amenities and it is obvious that she paid close attention to all details (spa-quality body scrub, spa-quality toiletries, and clear and easy check-in/check-out process). This place is very tastefully decorated with beautiful details (I swear this place should be featured on HGTV!), quiet, SAFE, and was the perfect place for my solo weekend retreat. Rachelle was a most hospitable hostess, as she enthusiastically suggested places to eat and provided information about local kayaking when I inquired. If you are looking for a peaceful vibe to unwind for a getaway, book this stay NEEEOW! You won't regret it!"
13862,491,I have been here five plus times. We come every year for Spring break. Shelly is a wonderful human being. So much attention to detail to make your stay as perfect as it could be.
13863,491,Amazing location and cozy place to stay!
13864,491,This place is literally at the base of the dunes not many beachfront communities you can get that close-basic and quaint. I would try and reserve units 1-5 with number 1 being closest to the beach.
13865,491,"This is our second time staying with Shelly! We stayed Tiki hut #6. The room is located under the main building. It was a pleasant surprise that we had two rooms though it was not needed. The room is a good size for a small family. Shelly had everything we needed on our weekend getaway to include - microwave, mini fridge (with a small freezer), cups, some plates and dish soap. A bonus to our room was the easy access to the parking area from a back door. This made it easy to bring in our luggage and fishing poles. I would recommend enjoying your breakfast out front on the bench swing with a cup of coffee to start the day off. We look forward to staying again in the future."
13866,491,"I think it was a bit overpriced for two nights. I think next time we will stay in a nearby hotel. Most hotels have a pool and offer breakfast. Well, there might not be another time. This little jaunt to the beach was because I love the ocean and my husband paid for this little trip for my 75th birthday."
13867,491,GREAT place for a short stay :) Great walk to the ocean! Perfect for 3 or 4 people. Fantastic outside areas!!
13868,491,"Great location near beach
Everything you need , very close to the beach
Perfect getaway for a short period"
13869,491,Awesome Stay
13870,491,Great location! Room and communal areas were very clean. The host is friendly and communicative. Easy beach access and close to good restaurants. Would definitely recommend this spot!
13871,491,"Shelly is a great host, very friendly and caring!"
13872,491,Great location. Room smelled a bit like mildew.
13873,491,Perfect location! The room was very clean and accurate when compared to pictures advertised. Would stay here again!
13874,491,"This was our second summer coming to Beach Haven, and we were so glad to be back. The property is always so nice and welcoming. Shelly is a great host and always very responsive and helpful. We love the proximity to the beach and the privacy of #6. So many great places to relax and unwind. Hoping my husband will let me come back a 3rd time ;)"
13875,491,"Great place, great location"
13876,491,"Shelly is a wonderful host, and her Beach Haven place is a little gem in the OBX! Everything is so cozy, clean, and adorable! You are right across the street from the beach (literally steps away) and the beach is never crowded. The outdoor shower is very refreshing, and we loved the deck (above the shower) and the hammock and swing that suite 6 has to offer! This was our second stay here (last summer, we stayed in Tiki Hut 2). We are certainly planning on coming back again!"
13877,491,Great location and everything was as described.
13878,491,Small but VERY cute setup outside
13879,491,Great location. So nice to just walk over the small bank and enjoy the beautiful ocean🐳
13880,491,Fantastic little place we found. Close to the beach and Shelly is a phenomenal host. Everything you need for a great beach trip.
13881,491,"Very comfortable, clean and had everything we needed. Super close to the beach, which was very convenient. I would recommend to my friends."
13882,491,"Wonderful stay at Beach Haven. Rooms and grounds meticulously kept. Porch swings and hammock to relax on. We ate an evening meal at the picnic table. Very pleasant. Shelly’s dining recommendations were just our style - local/family-owned, delicious food, cool vibe. Shelly is lovely and so is her place. Will stay here when in OBX."
13883,491,"Amazing stay at the beach! Can't beat the location and amenities, perfect host bent over backwards to help. Overall epicly great accomodations for a short stay!! And take the outdoor shower!"
13884,491,Shelly was absolutely amazing. Her rooms were cute and homey. nothing big or fancy but from the experience we had this weekend this little Island is very homey so her place fits perfect! when staying at Beach haven take a moment to lay on the hammock and enjoy the night sky(especially if you don't get a good view at home. we definitely enjoyed and look forward to returning(if I had my way Shelly might have had a permanent guest)
13885,491,Wonderful experience and great access to the beach.
13886,491,Great stay!
13887,491,"We enjoyed the stay very much, we found the appartment as described. Would book again."
13888,491,"Very cute property at an excellent location - one minute walk to the beach and short drives to good restaurants. There are a lot of nice touches such as the hammock, swing chairs, and kids' toys and picnic table. We stayed in a cute two bedroom suite although we thought it was a little bit on the smaller side for 2 adults and 2 kids. However, we enjoyed our stay overall!"
13889,491,The two room suite was perfect for our traveling needs. My husband and I traveled with our 15 year or daughter and her friend. The separate bedroom gave them the privacy they desired while still being close. The bedrooms are conjoined by the bathroom. The outdoor area was perfect to enjoy a morning cup of coffee and the beach is right across the street. We utilized the corn hole boards and grill one day. The only recommendation I would have is to put numbers on the doors to each unit. They are currently unlabeled so we were a little confused which room was ours when we arrived. Luckily Shelly was nearby to point us in the right direction.
13890,491,This was our second time staying at Shelly’s at we couldn’t of been happier! It’s the perfect spot. Can’t wait to visit again soon!
13891,491,"Shelly was friendly, helpful and very welcoming. A hidden gem for sure. We will visit again!🙏👍💞"
13892,491,A great beach getaway! Just steps to the beach. A great outdoor shower with a perfect spot above the shower to sit and have your morning coffee and watch the sunrise and see and hear the ocean. Great personal touches to the room like the essential oil diffuser and delicious coffee. A very comfortable bed and sheets too. The host Shelly was so nice! We can’t wait to come back!
13893,491,"What a great location, just steps from the beach!! Close to everything. Very clean and comfortable rooms."
13894,491,Shelly’s place was extremely clean and steps to the beach. We really enjoyed the atmosphere and cleanliness as well as convenience to the beach. Will definitely be coming back
13895,491,"This place is too good but really true, too. The entire experience was fantastic - the unbeatable location - right across from a private beach, very warm and helpful host (thank you, Shelly!), and a friendly-adequate combination of inside and outside space. If we come back to OBX, we know where we are staying again - at Shelly's place :-)"
13896,491,We loved our stay at Shelly's Beach Haven. The easy beach access was great. The location was very convenient as we traveled North on OBX one day and South on another day. We really appreciated being just outside of the busiest parts of the Outer Banks. Shelly was so welcoming and we would definitely stay with her again.
13897,491,Great location great room!! Recommend this place 💯
13898,491,"Excellent spot with a great feel! We planned a little Labor Day get away and Beach Haven was just the spot. Everything was exactly as advertised and Shelly did an excellent job answering all our questions before arrival.

Beach Haven is perfectly located across the street from a wonderful beach that is very relaxed and family friendly. It's not too large and feels more like a small resort than anything else.

Shelly was a wonderful host and we'll be recommending Beach Haven to our friends."
13899,491,"Shelly's place was awesome!! I am so glad that I came across it. I booked the Airbnb and within minutes she called me and had the room ready to go. Check-in was a breeze, and the room was so cute and so clean! Our room had two bedrooms and a shared bathroom - this is an old motel that she has converted into an Airbnb so each room is basically a hotel room, only well decorated and cute. The location is perfect - you're literally across the street from the beach. It was great to be able to walk back to grab a few more drinks and come right back out. Shelly's recommendation list for where to eat around town was of great help too - I really appreciated that attention to detail. The room had everything - soft sheets, fluffy towels, comfortable beds, and it was a sweet addition to have cups, plates, and silverware on site too. She had cornhole available to play on the property, bikes to check out and use, a little library full of books, boogie boards/noodles for the ocean, an outdoor shower, a porch swing, and a hammock. I have already recommended this place to friends and I would love to come back and stay here again!"
13900,491,"Everything went very smoothly. We were shocked to not have a common area room inside, as it was just 2 bedrooms and a bathroom. However, shellys outside area was perfect. We were able to utilize the space outside, as there was plenty of space to sit and relax. The outside shower was also a huge plus, as most of my group preferred to use that one! We would definitely stay again as it is just a few steps over the dune to the beach."
13901,491,"I am very happy that you all enjoyed your stay here at Beach Haven! It was great to host you all! I am sorry that you were ""shocked"" to not have a common area inside the suite. Suite 6 is described as our 2 bedroom suite and all areas of our suite are outlined in the listing and photos. There was not a common area mentioned or pictured. We do have multiple outdoor common areas for guests to enjoy and suite 6 is in a special nook that offers a swing and hammock. Hope you enjoy the rest of summer!"
13902,491,My friend and I had a wonderful time staying at Shelly's place! It really is just steps from the beach and there are a lot of great restaurants within a mile. The porch was wonderful to wait out the thunderstorms that rolled through in the afternoon. Beds and linens were comfortable and the towels were good quality. Shelly was friendly and helpful and made sure my friend and I had a great time. Would definitely stay again!
13903,491,An absolute treasure. The location alone is amazing but throw in the hospitality and you have a true winner.
13904,491,Shelly was amazing. Super helpful in providing recommendations and very accommodating. The location can't be beat!
13905,491,"We loved staying at Beach Haven for our recent vacation. The room was clean and welcoming and the facilities had so much to offer! We made use of the hammock, porch swing, adirondacks, picnic table, outdoor shower, bags, and viewing deck. We really loved having the beach so close, especially when enjoying the sunrise or looking for ghost crabs at night. The check in process was easy, communication was great, cleanliness was superb....we gave nothing but great things to say!! Stay here, you won't regret it! We are already talking about our return visit!"
13906,491,Lovely
13907,491,"This was a good place for our family of 4.

The pros: right across the street from the ocean. This unit (#6) has a hammock and porch swing which is nice. Shelly was helpful and communicative. The beach is clean and nice. There is an outdoor shower and they have chairs and boogie boards there you can use. We saw dolphins at the beach!

Things to consider: there is no kitchen, just a small fridge and a microwave. Most restaurants don’t have outdoor seating (if you are being covid cautious) and they all had really long waits even early in the day so it would have been nice to be able to cook in more. It was a little tight for the 4 of us- 2 bedrooms and a bathroom without a lot of room to move around. We were outside a lot though.

Overall it was a great place to spend a few days near the ocean as we enjoyed our time"
13908,491,"Many places anymore leave a person feeling like a customer rather than a guest. Beach Haven was certainly an exception to this! The property was very clean and comfortable and really had everything we needed on our stay to relax. The proximity to the beach was incredible and there is so much good food right around the area. The value of this location far exceeds the cost and I can confidently say that staying here is money well spent. What sets Beach Haven apart from most vacation stays is the host. Shelly does a wonderful job responding to questions and tending to the location. What sets Beach Haven apart, however, is that Shelly made us feel less like customers and more like guests...and that's so hard to come by today."
13909,491,"location great across from beach. Outdoor shower, bags, hammock, all very fun. Room wasn't huge but comfy."
13910,491,"We stayed in Tiki #6 and the unit was extremely clean and overall everything and more than described in the posting. The property as a whole was beautifully maintained and was perfect for our family vacation as it was very quiet and well managed. The beach is directly adjacent to the property and we enjoyed watching plenty of beautiful wild life including dolphins, osprey, pelicans, and much more! There is plenty of excellent restaurant options close by.

The host was excellent and very prompt with communication and repeatedly went out of her way to accommodate us!"
13911,491,"Great location! It was so convenient to just walk across the street and be on the beach. Nice, clean room. Nice landscaping and beautiful lawn, great for cornhole or just hanging out. We also made use of the gas grill."
13912,493,"Great stay for a mom and 5yo. Everyone was very welcoming and kind. Room was great, didn’t hear much of anything and it had plenty of room. My kid loved the hammock. Drinks were well made and a nice food menu. Would definitely come back."
13913,493,Fantastic location with lovely staff. Would always come back and stay here when visiting Blowing Rock
13914,493,"We loved it here. First time in this spot after many other stays at Blowing Rock, but this one we would come back to for sure. Comfortable bed, free smoothies and coffee every morning, and walkable to everything. While our room had a hammock which was cool, a couch would have been nice for relaxing and watching tv before bed. Otherwise, staff was amazing and we can wait to book our next trip."
13915,493,We loved our stay at Hellbender. Room 1 was perfect and loved the hammock. Bed was very comfortable and loved our smoothies in the morning. Definitely will stay here again.
13916,493,Second time in Blowing Rock but first time staying at Hellbender. Loved it! Perfect location and super charming. The weather conditions were freezing but the room stayed nice and warm. Even had the chance to meet Chef Hunter and could tell how much passion and energy he and the team put into making Hellbender an exceptional experience.
13917,493,Loved staying here and having the restaurant and bar in house. Definitely convenient walking distance to Main Street.
13918,493,Wonderful Experience all Around!
13919,493,"A really great hotel, with super friendly staff and in a superb location. Loved our room and fell in love with the town of Blowing Rock. Would recommend to anyone and everyone! Hope to be back!"
13920,493,"Great stay, as always. Kind and attentive staff, lively restaurant, fantastic hiking/walking right out the front door. Favorite place to escape and recharge."
13921,493,We really loved staying at Hellbender. All the staff was super friendly and helpful. The front porch was fabulous to just relax and eat or drink. The mattress was comfy and our room was spacious.
13922,493,This place is a home away from home. Everyone is so nice and tries so hard to make your stay happy and comfortable. It is very convenient to downtown. Delicious food and drinks. The room was super clean and comfortable. You won’t regret staying here!
13923,493,Hellbender kindly accepted a guest from my vacation rental when we experienced an emergency which shut down our cottage. Much appreciated!
13924,493,Great Inn. Lots of character. Loved that it was dog friendly. Great location to explore the town of Blowing Rock.
13925,493,"We had a fabulous long weekend at Hellbender. The staff was amazing…friendly, fun, and very efficient. The location was perfect and our room was super clean and comfortable. We definitely will be back."
13926,493,Great location!
13927,493,"Great location, nice clean room and enjoyable B&B feel with enough privacy and a great front porch to enjoy a drink or meal and people watch!!"
13928,493,We arrived after dinner on the Fourth of July. Despite the late arrival on a holiday check in was very easy and the Airbnb host gave plenty of recommendations for catching sunset and fire works as well as a last minute dinner in town. Overall the room was very comfortable and clean and everything was provided for. Quick walk to main st.
13929,493,"Great stay, as usual! Light-filled space right in the middle of Blowing Rock, with a lively restaurant scene in the evenings. Love being able to go for long walks right out the front door."
13930,493,"The Hellbender was great! The convenience of the restaurant & bar downstairs made for a great stay. The location is perfect, just a couple minute walk from downtown Blowing Rock."
13931,493,"We absolutely loved this place. Pet friendly, great staff, very close to everything and unique, comfortable rooms. The floors were squeaky but we didn’t really care because the rooms are pretty soundproof. It kind of added to the places charm! Recommend it."
13932,493,Great place right off of Main Street. Great hospitality and great room.
13933,510,Perfect size for me and my friends for our short weekend getaway. Looked exactly like the pictures and was very spacious to accommodate 6 people .
13934,510,"It was a great cabin get away, hot tub was awesome."
13935,510,"such a cozy, private little mountain getaway! Josh was very accommodating and so quick to respond when i had a question once checked in. the hot tub and fire pit were by far our favorite parts :) will definitely book again!"
13936,510,"Josh's place is nice and very clean. The hot tub, fire pit, deck were nice. Make sure you have the alarm access down pat so it doesn't go off on you as it did me when we arrived at 10p. That was upsetting! Once we got past that it was fine, but it does beep every time the door is opened. The only bathroom is downstairs and the bedrooms are upstairs as an FYI. The driveway is too small to turn around in for most vehicles. I'm fine backing down even though it is long, steep and narrow so it wasn't an issue for me, but some may find this challenging. Nice place overall."
13937,510,Nice cabin and not too far from town. We had a good stay and would recommend to others. Thank you.
13938,510,We had a great stay at Josh’s place. Such a cozy cabin! Loved the outdoor fire place 😍
13939,510,Lots of space. Great for a family getaway.
13940,510,Nice and cozy place!
13941,510,Cabin was a quick drive to the downtown area but set enough away we felt nice a secluded! The only bathroom is on the first floor and bedrooms are all upstairs so just keep that in mind. Hot tub worked great and was the highlight of our stay!
13942,510,"Cutest little cabin so close to downtown! The location was perfect & they stay was comfortably cozy! The host was awesome & we plan to be coming back very soon, as I will be bookmarking this stay! 😇"
13943,510,Fantastic communication from Josh! Comfy beds and great hot tub area!
13944,510,Location is very nice and convenient. The hot tub was the main reason we stayed here for our mom/daughter fall Asheville trip. loved star gazing and it was very lovely. overall a good experience but I will say the upstairs has a weird vibe. We slept on the couches downstairs bc it just felt uncomfortable. Can’t explain it much more than that.
13945,510,"Great place to stay in Asheville. Nice area, clean cabin, and a hot tub to boot. Josh was a very communicative and helpful host."
13946,510,Really cool cabin with awesome hot tub/fire pit set up. Great for a weekend away with friends. Gives you the cabin vibe but still close enough to down town to be able to go out
13947,510,The cabin was super nice for a quick night away. 20 mins from downtown Asheville tucked away in the mountains. Cozy home with a welcoming porch. Loved sitting by the fire and getting in the hot tub. AC was great!
13948,510,Great cabin. We really enjoyed our time there. It was close to everything we wanted to do. Loved the hot tub!
13949,510,"cabin was clean with plenty of towels provided. Enjoyed the hot tub, fire pit and grilling out. very close to downtown, super convenient yet feels like ur in the middle of the woods.Easy to find as well."
13950,510,"Nice and clean private mountain cabin. Private hot tub, lovely view. everything you need is there."
13951,510,"Great house, location and easy host"
13952,510,"Bang for your Buck! Charming cabin with everything you need close to Downtown Asheville! Peaceful and quite. Get it now, because I guarantee someone else will."
13953,510,"Nice place, great for a weekend getaway! Josh was very helpful"
13954,510,Close to West Asheville with a great outdoor space!
13955,510,"Great place with excellent views, not too far from Asheville. 10/10 would stay again."
13956,510,"Great cabin in a quiet, woodsy area West of Asheville. Hot tub and grill worked perfectly, we were able to get good eats and relax afterwards too. Very convenient to highway access and no issues with the property."
13957,510,Nice quite cabin on a hill
13958,510,The cabin was great and met my expectations for my family. No real issues. Would stay again.
13959,510,Super Clean little place with privacy. The one downfall would be that the only bathroom is downstairs. Other that our stay was wonderful!
13960,510,We had a wonderful time in Asheville at Josh’s BnB! This will be on our list of favorite places to stay at for future trips!
13961,510,Great little cabin in the woods yet close to downtown. Very clean and well appointed. Josh is a great communicator. The only reason I gave it a 4 is because the only bathroom is on the main floor not with the bedrooms upstairs. When I was younger this wouldn’t have even been an issue at all. Overall we had a great time and enjoyed the cabin very much.
13962,510,Great stay. Exactly what we needed for a group of four. Might be a tight squeeze with only one bathroom for a larger group.
13963,510,Josh’s cabin was the perfect weekend getaway. The hut tub was warm and ready for us. Only about 10 minutes from town but lots of privacy. The outdoor fire table was great as well!
13964,510,Great place to stay!
13965,510,Nice place for an overnight stay.
13966,510,"The cabin was a great escape! We had previously booked another cabin which we were unable to access due to the snow storm. Not wanting to cancel our trip we reached out to Josh when we found this cabin. Josh was very quick to respond and helpful. We were in his cabin that evening. The location is central, not far from Asheville and a close drive to many trail options too. The hot tub was the biggest draw for us. We used it every night we were there."
13967,510,Only thing to keep in mind (for winter weather) is the steep driveway. Everything else was wonderful!
13968,510,"We had such an amazing time in Josh's cabin. The view, the cozy atmosphere, and I could not get my kids out of hot tub :) We also cooked smores on the gas fire pit, worked some with our laptops while kids were playing outside. Asheville is one crazy funky town with all the arts, food, architecture and tons of history. We also went on a number of hikes on Blueridge Parkway.
Such a unique combination of everything.

Highly recommend Josh and his cabin!"
13969,510,"Great location, clean, and great communication."
13970,510,We enjoyed our time at this home. I would definitely recommend staying here!
13971,510,"Great location, convenient to West Asheville. Loved the hot tub & fire pit!"
13972,510,We had a great stay at the cabin! We enjoyed the privacy and how quiet it was for our 10 year anniversary. It was a quick 10-12 minute drive to downtown! We used AVL ride one night and it worked out great! The cabin is well stocked too! Thanks again!
13973,510,"Great stay in Ashville. very private deck with great hot, tub fire table and grill. Quiet and secluded. very clean comfortable house with a great kitchen."
13974,510,nice place. good value for money. close to everything but still private
13975,510,Super cute little cabin. Close to town but still felt secluded. Josh was very responsive.
13976,510,"Had a spectacular girls weekend at the cabin. Super cute and rustic and close to downtown Asheville. Enjoyed spending evenings on the deck and in the hot tub. The cabin had all of the kitchen necessities and was very clean. Communication with the host was perfect, and josh is quite responsive. Would definitely book this rental again since it is the perfect spot to really enjoy the area."
13977,510,beautiful cabin and lovey spot that’s close in to town but very serene. Responsive host
13978,510,"This cabin was so cute!! I loved the ambiance, the privacy, and the location. It was close enough to downtown but felt probably tucked away in the woods. The beds were comfy, kitchen was stocked & the hot tub was wonderful. Josh was so quick to respond to the questions I had. 10/10 would stay here again!"
13979,510,"Great cabin! Super clean, and the hot tub was very nice. I went with a few friends and we had a great time. Josh was very responsive and helpful with anything we needed. Definitely recommend it!"
13980,510,"We just enjoyed a great family vacay in Asheville at this cute cabin. It’s cozy and has everything you’ll need to make a family meal or enjoy a movie night in the front room. The driveway was stepper than I expected but after a few days you get use to it. It’s close to everything in town and Josh, the host, is amazing and communicates well. We had a good time,"
13981,510,My son was home from Germany (military) for his wedding and stayed one night. The cabin was ok and the owner was quick to respond when he had issues with the hot tub.
13982,510,We stayed at Josh’s cabin as part of an anniversary trip. Josh was very responsive to our questions upon arrival. We were hoping to use the hot tub when we arrived after a long drive but it took a few hours to even get to 93 degrees and never got warmer so we had to wait until the next day. (Apparently it had been drained and refilled that morning) It was a bummer because we were only staying two nights. The cabin overall was average. The walls are very thin so noise traveled easily throughout the rooms. The bed was very uncomfortable which made sleeping the first night almost impossible. The bathroom is located downstairs and bedrooms are upstairs. The deck has quite a few nail heads popping up and we had to be extra careful not to stub our toes. Overall the cabin seems more suited for a group of friends hanging out and not as much for a romantic couples getaway.
13983,510,Great location. Only 15 minutes from downtown. Nice cozy little cabin with a hot tub and fire pit. Really enjoyed the stay and would definitely stay here again.
13984,510,Great place! Would definitely return 😊
13985,510,Absolutely awesome! Clean and comfy is an understatement you will have a blast!
13986,510,Really quiet cabin. We had a great time. Would definitely stay here again!
13987,510,Great little place to relax and unwind while still have the comfort of the town just a short drive away
13988,510,"Great place and close to downtown. Lovely hot tub, fire pit and views outdoor. The mattresses aren’t the comfiest, but those are always personal preferences. All around a great place for a long weekend."
13989,510,"Great updated cabin - we loved the hot tub and fire pit for relaxing in the evening after a long day of hiking. Josh is very responsive, all communications were comprehensive, the kitchen is outfitted better than any other rental we've been to, and the place was very clean."
13990,510,"Cool place, clean, and close proximity to downtown Asheville"
13991,510,"Great house, very clean and a short drive to downtown Asheville. We really enjoyed our stay, especially sitting on the porch and enjoying the hot tub!"
13992,510,"We loved our Asheville stay at Josh’s. The cabin was so clean and inviting. We loved the hot tub and sitting on the front porch wrapped in a blanket. It was so conveniently located to downtown, yet isolated and private. We absolutely highly recommend this place!"
13993,510,Beautiful and comfortable! We really enjoyed our short stay
13994,510,We enjoyed our stay at this cabin. The hot tub was so relaxing.
13995,510,"Josh's cabin is spacious, warm, and very mountain-esqe! There were three rooms, two beds and one pullout, a full kitchen, and two very soft and comfy couches. The hot tub is perfect! The driveway is a doozy but once you figure it out, the entire space is beautiful and just what a weekend away called for. I will probably be returning!"
13996,510,"The place was awesome, it was close to town but felt secluded. Everything was great!"
13997,510,The house is in a great location. You feel secluded but can also get to downtown Asheville in 10 minutes. Josh was easy to communicate with and quickly responded to any questions we had.
13998,510,Stayed here for one night and had a great day in Asheville! Hot tub was already hot upon arrival and the space was honestly cuter in person than in the pictures. Not too far from stuff and the nature around the cabin is relaxing :-)
13999,510,"Our stay at the cabin was good. There were a few things I was unsatisfied with. For example, no WiFi, couldn’t watch Netflix etc. No TVs in any of the bedrooms. There were wine glasses, but no wine opener. No wash cloths. The couch had a huge tear in it, and I thought that seemed a bit odd for the amount we paid to stay bc it’s such an easy fix. Josh, the host, was very helpful and communicative! there’s just a few small things that could make the stay that much better. The house kinda has a haunted vibe too it also, but don’t let like deter you from staying here!"
14000,510,"Perfect location! You definitely get the cabin vibes, with plenty of privacy and gorgeous views, but you're only a short Uber ride away from downtown Asheville. The space was clean, cozy, and comfortable, and Josh was super responsive to any questions we had. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for a night away!"
14001,510,"We really enjoyed our stay at this cabin. The hot tub was so relaxing after a day of climbing looking glass. The location is excellent and very close to the city, but secluded in a wooded neighborhood. Very private and natural setting perfect social distancing or a retreat from the city. Would highly recommend."
14002,510,"Nice place, relaxing time"
14003,510,"Beautiful, peaceful setting. Bring your own spices if cooking in and hair and body wash if you want high quality. You will also need to bring your own hair dryer."
14004,510,Great place to stay whatever the reason. You feel like you are out in the deep woods when at the property but really anything you need is a 5 minute drive. Josh was very responsive with any questions I had. Hope to be back and highly recommended
14005,510,Clean and quiet. Hot tub was amazing. Very convenient to West Asheville and Downtown.
14006,510,"Absolutely amazing all round.
Will most definitely return!
100% recommend... you will not be disappointed. 😊"
14007,510,Great place. Not too far from town and it’s pretty secluded for the area. Ive gotten a different Airbnb every time I’m in Asheville but I’ll probably book this place again when we come back.
14008,510,It was great
14009,510,awesome place
14010,510,Nice - clean - relax and the view is amazing
14011,510,Great Stay. We enjoyed it
14012,510,"Great mountain escape. Quiet, clean, excellent outdoor patio with hot tub. Definitely a ""cabin"" appearance but the necessities were all in good shape. Beds and sofas were very comfortable too."
14013,510,The location was perfect and the space was cozy. Beds were comfortable and the space clean. Our only complaint was that there was not a bathroom on the same floor as the bedrooms.
14014,510,"This cabin was clean, and in a great location. Just 10 minutes to downtown asheville but still felt secluded and cozy!"
14015,510,Close to Asheville but the cabin has nice privacy. Everything was very clean and it even had a hand sanitizer dispenser I’m assuming for COVID precautions. Host was quick to respond to any questions we had. Would recommend.
14016,510,"Stayed here with my 3 kids . We loved the cabin, was clean and comfortable. The porch was so nice and of course the hot tub was a bonus. Would definitely recommend."
14017,510,"My family enjoyed our stay at this cabin! Its nicely tucked away but still very close to downtown. Its beautiful, and made for a great getaway! Very clean and we enjoyed the hot tub."
14018,510,Exactly as described. I have zero complaints. Thankful I had a chance to be able to experience it.
14019,510,Had a great time at the cabin! Convenient location and easy to get to everything!
14020,510,"This is such fun little place. If you want some privacy its absolutely a great spot. They have hot tub, plates cups, silverware washer and dryer ect. Great location if you want to be away from the hustle bustle of the downtown area. But only minutes away. I think the furthest place was an 11 min drive. Great spot you will enjoy it. I highly recommend it."
14021,510,"Perfect experience at our first Airbnb. Host provided everything we needed for amenities and went the extra mile in service, even after we had left. Would definitely recommend if you want a quiet, remote, peaceful experience."
14022,510,"Cabin was larger than expected! Nice, quiet spot to get away for the weekend!"
14023,510,"I highly recommend this place! The stay was amazing, very clean, quiet, cozy, and warm. Great place to stay when you want to get away and relax."
14024,510,"Spot was ok could use a better host though, he was trying to blame me for things that wasn’t done and is trying to charge me 358 dollars, honestly could’ve found a better spot for cheaper"
14025,510,A lot of damage was caused by this guest and his group of partiers - and he is not taking responsibility for it. Fortunately this is a rare occurrence.
14026,510,Simply amazing!! I would recommend to anyone that would love to go!!!
14027,510,Great place convenient and still feels like out of town
14028,510,I plan to go back sometime soon. Everything was great.
14029,510,"It was a nice place cozy and not far from things to do. The house was clean and nice, the door lock gave some trouble would fave to do it multiple time when we would leave to get it to lock. But that wasn't a big problem."
14030,510,Was a great spot - it was quiet and private. Would definitely recommend.
14031,510,We had an awesome time. The cabin was amazing. Having the ability to set an alarm was also a plus. It was nice and peaceful. The view was amazing. I would recommend staying at this property to anyone.
14032,535,We absolutely loved our visit to the Julian Price House/Hillside. Michael is a great host and was very welcoming and happy to give us the lay of the land. The history on the property is very interesting. My husband and I found ourselves looking up all we could find about the property and prior owners. We both really enjoyed walking around and admiring the decor and wondering what it must have been like living in the home back in the day. We can’t wait to visit Greensboro again so we can book a room!
14033,535,"The house was beautiful, comfortable and immaculate. Lots of history, charm and character. In addition, Michael was an exceptional host. He was friendly and far more accommodating than he should have to be. In addition, I was traveling with my college-bound daughter and Michael was wonderful sharing his insight about the area, the college, and generally making her feel comfortable and respected. Would go back in a minute."
14034,535,Julian Price Mansion will not disappoint. We cannot wait to go back and spend more time at the property. Thank you Michael & Eric!
14035,535,Michael was a great host! We will be back!
14036,535,"My husband and I had a wonderful first year anniversary here. Everything was lovely, the rooms, the hosts, the entire area of Greensboro is fantastic. I would definitely come back! You have to see this place!"
14037,535,Fantastic and beautiful AirBNB. Carefully persevered piece of history. Michael and Erik's home is amazing and I can't wait to stay there again!
14038,535,"Michael was a great host! In addition to him being attentive, the house itself was amazing. There has been such an effort to keep the natural beauty of the home and maintain the Tudor style. It is a walkable distance to restaurants and the neighborhood was enjoyable just to walk around. I would encourage anyone who is thinking of staying here to do so!"
14039,535,"Magical, Incredible Stay! If you are looking to step into an impeccably decorated, warm and cozy historical home, look no further! The home is so incredibly charming I could have stayed there for a week! Michael is so accessible and makes it easy to communicate with him if you need to! I cannot say enough good things about the Julian Price House! The beds are cozy and comfortable, they have complimentary coffee, tea and treats, and the atmosphere is unmatched in any other airbnb I have stayed in! Just book this place and you won't be disappointed! I would give it a 10/10 if I could!"
14040,535,"This is a perfect gem with first class everything (service, tea, soap, sheets, and the list goes on)! Enjoyed walking through the lovely neighborhood. Thank you Michael for sharing your beautiful home!!"
14041,535,"Photos hardly do this property justice — between the overall architecture, decor, and thoughtful details and amenities provided by Michael and his family, I cannot recommend enough."
14042,535,We had an incredible stay at this gorgeous mansion. Highly recommended.
14043,535,"The Julian Price House provided a luxurious stay that was simply exquisite. The grounds were lovely and inviting, beckoning us to take that cup of coffee outside, stroll the gardens or just sit and absorb the peace and the beauty.
Hosts Michael and Eric were welcoming and extended their expertise in restaurants and activities to make sure we enjoyed ourselves at their home and in Greensboro.
We will treasure the memories of this trip. Charlie and Nancy Massa"
14044,535,"I simply cannot say enough good things about this place. The hosts, the details, the comfort, the beauty… Just book it. Don’t question it! It’s a true gem."
14045,535,"As I sit at the writing desk in the livingroom, I have to say..... OMG.... book. Book now for one of the best airbnb experiences ever! I've been here 5 nights do far and have two more to go. Slept like a baby each night. Must stay! BOOK. Don't even keep looking. You will thank yourself for doing so. BEST EVER! Oh, one more thing.....The host Michael is superb."
14046,535,"The Julian Price House is an amazing experience. You may find a place that cost less but you will not find another experience more eventful. From the care shown upon arrival, to the beautifully preserved history and lovely extras given by the proprietors, you'll instantly know that it is a one of a kind experience. If you have the opportunity to stay here for even one night, just do it."
14047,535,Great stay. Absolutely beautiful home with a wonderful history. Cannot wait to visit again.
14048,535,"It was an amazing experience that will not be forgotten. The beauty and nostalgia of the home was extraordinaire. I loved that I was able to explore the entire airbnb portion of the mansion. I was fortunate that I was the only guest at the time and I got to see every room and take in all of the glory of a 1929 mansion! I would recommend a stay for anyone visiting the Greensboro area. Fishers Park is wonderful, calm and the weather was perfect. I was met at the door by my host upon arrival, given a tour and a tutorial for the quirks of 1929 doors and windows and the bed was like sleeping on clouds. Everything was clean, accessible and just near perfect. I loved the Julian Price Mansion AirBnB, would recommend it to anyone and everyone and will be back!"
14049,535,Highly recommend this beautiful home. A number of inviting places to sit and relax both inside and out. Very comfortable bed and many thoughtful details throughout. Lovely and very helpful host. I will definitely return.
14050,535,Absolutely stunning! I planned a getaway for my husband and I and we were blown away at how beautiful the property was. Michael was very communicative and friendly. We learned a great deal about the property and surrounding neighborhood and enjoyed being within minutes from downtown Greensboro. We can’t wait to visit again!
14051,535,Michael is a wonderful host. You’d think he was a friend you haven’t seen a while with how he welcomes you into the house. We had the most pleasant stay
14052,535,lovely manor house in park like setting
14053,535,Awesome!
14054,535,"Michael was the most warm and welcome host. The property is breathtaking and the feel of ‘home’ is apparent at every turn. Every detail was met, the whole atmosphere had such an otherworld aura. From the music playing upon entering that stayed consistent to us arriving upstairs to our bedroom overlooking the property, it was perfect! The hillside house was a dream! They thought of it all, from the dining area treats if you get the hankering for something sweet or salty to a complimentary San Pellegrino, it was unmatched. We will be back and will recommend to anyone looking for an intimate getaway amidst all Greensboro has to offer. 10/10, must visit!"
14055,535,"I had been wanting to stay at the JPH for a while and got the opportunity to do so this
weekend . The checkin was easy as I was greeted by Michael who also provided a tour. The home is both grand and intimate. The Christmas decorations were up and added to the atmosphere. The entire house is well appointed and my accommodations were extremely comfortable and inviting. I felt like I had the home to my self.
If you are planning a trip to Greensboro, the JPH should be on your list! Michael, many thanks for the hospitality!
I’ll be back."
14056,535,This should be on everyone’s bucket list. The house is amazing and Michael is an excellent host! We absolutely enjoyed every minute of our stay!
14057,535,"We had a really lovely stay here. The host was friendly and helpful, the room very comfortable, and the location was perfect - it's across from a small park and has several great restaurants within walking distance. If all of that wasn't enough, I would recommend staying here just to admire and enjoy the beautiful details and decoration of the house and grounds!"
14058,535,This is such a beautiful home! We had the most pleasant and lovely stay. The house is exquisitely decorated. Highly recommended.
14059,535,This home is a gem in Greensboro! Michael was so welcoming and absolutely so patient and gracious with showing us around the home and talking with us about the history. This residence is a perfect home away from home. The attention to details only adds to the enjoyment of this trip! We felt right at home! Looking forward to returning soon for more adventures!
14060,535,What a beautiful estate!! Everything was perfect!
14061,535,We had a perfect staycation for our 8th anniversary. The room was beautiful and we loved all the period details. We felt like we were in Charleston :) Michael our host was very friendly and we enjoyed our conversation.
14062,535,"We stayed here for President’s Day weekend and found it to be beautiful, comfortable, very clean, and just an overall A+ experience. Michael has thought of every detail and the house is superbly appointed. As a guest, I felt at ease and spoiled. The linens were especially nice! The neighborhood is situated very close to downtown, so you can easily walk. Even nicer, it’s in a beautiful spot for walks and runs! We’ll definitely be back!"
14063,535,"Only stayed in Greensboro for one night and it was the perfect place! The home is beautiful, clean, quiet and comfortable. Michael communicated very well. I would definitely return again!"
14064,535,If you need a place to stay in Greensboro this is the place to go. The house and the environment were perfect! I would definitely come again.
14065,535,This is truly a magical spot. Stay here if you get the opportunity!
14066,535,Michael is a phenomenal host with an amazing place! Definitely will be back soon!
14067,535,Amazing place with so much history. Michael is an amazing host who goes above and beyond to ensure guest are happy.
14068,535,"Our stay here was wonderful! The whole home was open for us to enjoy, the decor is beautiful and the blend of modern touches and authentic time period history is beautifully married.
Everything is perfectly clean and welcoming !"
14069,535,"Pristine, polished perfection!! The house was impeccably clean and comfortable. The bedding top notch! The attention to detail in this home is extraordinary. Michael is the most laid back and kind host I’ve met so far. The area near the house has much to offer as well, but during my next visit I plan to spend more time lounging at the house reading the historical books and taking in more of the history."
14070,535,Can’t recommend this gorgeous home and the warm hospitality of the owners enough. We truly enjoyed our stay—the rooms are stunning— and cannot wait to return for our next visit!
14071,535,"AMAZING doesn’t even begin to describe this home! If the Devil is in the details, Michael and Eric really nailed it! They truly did a fantastic job bringing this gem back to life. From the moment you pull into the driveway, you are in awe of the elegance the home exudes. The location couldn’t be more perfect as it’s a hop skip and a jump to downtown and it’s walkable to restaurants and breweries. We will absolutely recommend this home to all our friends and family. We hope to make it back down to stay again!"
14072,580,Brights creek is an amazing weekend getaway.
14073,580,"Beautiful setting, and cozy, clean rooms. The lodge was very clean and cozy, and having the continental breakfast/ snack station was so helpful. Because they were fixing an issue with our original room, they upgraded us to one of the villas for a night. It was amazing! Had a great chef’s kitchen and amazing wrap around porch with fireplace outside and inside. Foliage was a little past peak, but it was still gorgeous and peaceful. We did a couple of the shorter hikes on the grounds, and it was great. I will say it’s about 20-30 min to go anywhere else off property (grocery store, etc.), but you really don’t need to! We didn’t want to leave!!!"
14074,580,"If you want to relax and have a great time this is the right place for you! The view is amazing, and the restaurant is really good! The chef Matthew is amazing! All staff is really nice! I can’t wait to go back!"
14075,580,"Great views of the mountains, beautiful sunrises and a nice big patio. We enjoyed the shower and the kitchenette with lots of snacks and drinks."
14076,580,"Can't wait to have you back, especially when the pool and and activity center opens fall 2022!"
14077,580,"We had a wonderful stay! Beautiful property, we plan to return again."
14078,580,We loved staying at Brights Creek. The lodge is beautiful and all of the staff is very nice. The mountain view from our balcony overlooking the golf course was lovely. We would definitely stay here again!
14079,580,Absolutely beautiful place and wonderful lodge! Thank you for the hospitality!!
14080,580,"Bright's Creek will pass all your Airbnb expectations! The property is absolutely beautiful. Perfect for Golfers and Equestrians or anyone just traveling through. The views, the beds, the shower, the decor, it was all so perfect! We can't wait to go back. Bryan was so nice and greeted us at the door soon as we pulled up!"
14081,580,Great get a way spot in the mountains. The room was really nice and the scenery is amazing. Didn’t get to play golf but looked like a very well kept course. Would recommend.
14082,580,"John -
Thanks so much for your feedback. Get back here to play some golf & we'll have the Grill serving dinner.
Bryan"
14083,580,"Super clean, very secluded. We were looking for peace and quiet and we found it for the most part. There is now a large deck off the restaurant right below the room balcony, which was not pictured here when we booked (because it's new) and that took away from some of the privacy aspect but it's a nice space for guests in rooms without balconies. The restaurant was not open for dinner and it's a bit of a drive to any other restaurant, but it was understandable as the lodge is just getting back into full swing. Overall, great stay even if you aren't a golfer. Would absolutely stay again!"
14084,616,Beautiful cabin!!
14085,616,"After a hot day, the temperatures dropped into the 40s. John came over to make this Florida girl had heat! I wish I could have stayed longer - enjoyed the scenery & birds."
14086,616,We had stayed in this same unit last year and had let the owner know of a few concerns that we had that did not negatively effect our visit but would enhance any future visits...upon our arrival we noticed that our recommendations were taken care of....thanks for another wonderful weekend!
14087,616,Cute and cozy cabin. It was all that we needed. Such a lovely part of a lovely state - so much to see and do.
14088,616,We had a lovely stay at Ashlie’s - very peaceful!
14089,616,"I had a wonderful stay! I did struggle to locate the cabin due to the height of the marker located on the hitch and because it was not reflective in the dark but the directions Ashlie provided prior to check in were very helpful. I had an issue logging onto the wifi but the gracious hosts responded to my late night message and got it sorted out which was much appreciated!

I absolutely adored the cozy cabin and cute set up! The bedroom was so cozy with the little fireplace and had plenty of pillows and blankets. I would love to stay again and highly recommend these cabins to any fellow travelers! I felt super safe and still enjoyed privacy and peaceful mountain views. I was so grateful to find such a lovely place for such an incredible value which made my hiking trip possible - thank you!"
14090,616,"The stay at Ashlie's cabin was great. I worked through the day at a remote office and my wife said she peacefully enjoyed reading and working from the cabin with no disturbances, plenty of light, and a comfortable atmosphere. Thank you, Ashlie, great place to stay!"
14091,616,"Very close to downtown Franklin, the location was beautiful and the hosts were extremely helpful and helped us find our cabin even when we arrived late at night."
14092,616,very nice
14093,616,My second stay will book again. Next time I come to Franklin
14094,616,"Very nice stay, had everything we needed. Cozy and quiet! Easy to find and not too far from surrounding amenities!"
14095,616,"Wonderful stay, the cabin was a perfect size for two. It was clean and exactly as photos show."
14096,616,Beautiful place. John was very responsive and came whenever we needed anything. Can’t wait to come back next year
14097,616,Excellent stay! Highly recommended!
14098,616,This is a perfect little cabin for 2. My husband and I stayed one night just passing through and it was just right!
14099,616,Loved it very cozy place
14100,616,"Very clean, quiet, and well-appointed little home."
14101,616,Had a great stay! It was quiet and very relaxing and close to what we needed. Thanks for everything!
14102,616,"The shower in the cabin did not work properly. The hot water could not be regulated. It would run stone cold and then scalding hot. When you tried to adjust it, it would go stone cold again. The hot water would only stay hot for about 30 seconds. When I reached out to Ashlie about it, I got no communication from her at all -- no call back, no message. We had to check out without showering after having spent the day at the mines and really needing a shower. She also didn't respond to a messaged question concerning whether a DVD player was in the cabin. The lack of communication with this owner was very disappointing, as the cabin itself was nice, clean, and well-appointed as well as convenient to downtown and the mines."
14103,616,We are so sorry we did not respond to your call or message. The shower has been fixed needed adjustment in the mixing valve.
14104,616,Cozy little cabin in the woods and has everything you need for a relaxing stay! We enjoyed the fireplace in the bedroom as the temperature dropped below freezing when we were there and it kept us warm all night!
14105,616,Great little cabin in a beautiful setting of cabins and RVs. The location is perfect !
14106,616,"Uber clean, super cute, & great location!"
14107,616,"Thank you Ashlie for an amazing experience! The location is beautifully rural but only 10 minutes to groceries and restaurants. The setting is on a wooded hillside, private but feels secure with other cabins and RVs on the property. The cabin was comfortable and well furnished for our stay. We even cooked a few meals in the well-stocked kitchen. The hosts responded promptly to any questions or requests we made.
I would highly recommend this listing and hope to return again soon!"
14108,616,I spent 2 night exploring the Highland and Cashiers area.
14109,616,"Wonderful stay! Cozy, clean and very well furnished. Location is easy to get to and groceries and restaurants a short drive. Interior woodwork is beautiful and the outside deck is lovely at night with comfortable seating and a serene wooded view. We will be back!"
14110,616,Great little cabin. Clean quiet and comfortable.
14111,616,"Location!!! Loved that this little cabin was on a nice, quiet lot, and extremely close to the Highlands area. The place was clean and cozy and we will most definitely be back!"
14112,616,"Very clean, great location. Even though there were multiple RV campers & other cabins occupied it was very quite as well. Great place to sit and enjoy the sounds of nature."
14113,616,Cozy spot easy to get to.
14114,616,"Very good value,clean and cozy. Would come back in winter. I would get there during day and not a night as area is a bit hard to find at night but we are new the area."
14115,616,"You will love staying in this cabin! We only spent 1 night, but left wishing we could stay longer. The location is VERY peaceful & quiet, and was convenient to the event we were attending. Easy check in & out; price easily beat out other places with the added bonus of not having to deal with loud noises in the next room, slamming doors, etc. We are looking forward to staying there again 💗"
14116,616,This place had everything we needed for our short stay in The Highlands!
14117,616,Lovely little cabin just 10 minutes from Franklin. We really enjoyed our stay.
14118,616,This place is well worth the money and the cabin is perfectly located in Franklin. We loved it!
14119,616,Great place to stay!
14120,878,"Kathryn created a little paradise! The room was as cute as can be but camp itself is absolutely incredible!!! So cute and clean, several comunal areas like the fire pit, beach, swing, you name it, she thought of it! The bathrooms and showers are also top notch, not at all glamping, even though they are separate from the bedrooms, they are heated and clean and full on bathrooms! 100% recommend"
14121,878,Very relaxing
14122,878,By far our favorite Airbnb stay thus far! They have thought of everything. Thank you for an awesome stay. Will be back!
14123,878,"Super lovely place. It’s a need spot for a weekend getaway. The place itself is on a cute campground. I’d recommend exploring the surrounding areas, lots to do!
Only problem we had was Catawba Falls - it’s closed until the Spring.
Had a long week at work so we booked a last minute trip and it was definitely worth it. Super relaxing and restful. My wife and I definitely recommend it!

Be sure to eat at McDowell Local, it’s tasty!"
14124,878,"First class experience with Kathryn and her vision for something very ‘Golden’ as the property is named. My tiny cabin, its decor and comfort, complete with essentials expected from a nice hotel, had its own covered patio and fire pit, all situated right beside a gently flowing river. The bathrooms and separate showers were impeccably clean and tastefully decorated unlike any ‘camp’ experience I’ve had before. An easy walk down closer to the river had a sandy area, which was the perfect place to set up a chair and relax. With a backpack full of books, a journal and pen, I found a place to reflect and just ‘be’ in the quiet outdoors. It was that need to ‘escape’ for a solo mini retreat that led me to Golden, but I did not expect to find a little piece of heaven. Golden is affordable as priced, but the value is exponential considering what it is, which is an elevated ‘camp’ tiny cabin retreat one can only understand by being there. I’ll be going back soon. Highly recommend!!"
14125,878,"Very beautiful & peaceful setting, room was nice and most importantly clean. Love how modern the bathhouse was. Pet friendly As well. Definitely coming back again !"
14126,878,This spot was beautiful! The whole place was so cute and within 10 mins of downtown Marion. Campground was well kept and shared spaces were awesome! We are already planning our next trip back!
14127,878,We were absolutely in awe with this place! We loved the little cabin we stayed in. We enjoyed the amenities that were accessible to us during our stay! Super cozy and great weekend we had. We were all the more grateful to have brought our pups with us!
14128,878,Cute place.
14129,878,We had the best time! Such a cute area! The room was perfect for what we needed! Would definitely come back!
14130,878,Absolutely loved it here ! I will definitely be visiting again soon with my kids!
14131,878,We had a wonderful anniversary weekend spent in the cabin! I cannot say enough good things about this place. It was nice to disconnect from the world and relax. We will definitely be back.
14132,878,"This place was amazing! It has everything you need for a relaxing getaway. Plenty of outdoor areas to hangout during the day, and then roast s’mores and relax by the fire at night (:"
14133,878,Second time I’ve stayed here and it’s one of my favorite stays. Very peaceful and an awesome property. Highly recommend it.
14134,878,We had a great time.
14135,878,"This place is a perfect getaway. I took my girlfriend out here so we can relax and spend quality time and that’s exactly what we received. The room was perfect. Everything was clean and looks exactly like the picture. The location is great, not too far from Asheville and close to some mountains. We definitely will be returning!"
14136,878,"This place is off the beaten path. It is a diamond in the rough surroundings. The price is perfect and it’s a very clean , quiet and quaint place to visit! You will not regret your decision to stay here. You will however be about a 30 min drive to chimney rock or lake lure. There is zero cell service!!! WiFi is the best I’ve ever seen here. Better than my home! We will be back!!"
14137,878,"Cutest little campground. Nice, high end touches and really affordable. There’s a lot to do if you like nature and hiking! Comfy bed and air conditioning in cabins!

The campground is beside a really busy street but it gets really quiet at night. The showers are cleaned daily but there’s only 3, which is good for the size of the campground— it stays pretty steamy though (bc of showers being taking back to back)

Other than that, we had a very nice stay! It was the perfect little getaway and will be back!"
14138,878,Absolutely loved Gold River Camp! The cabin was amazing and the property is just GORGEOUS! Fantastic location with so much to do or so many comfy spots to relax and do absolutely nothing too. Will be back.
14139,878,Kathryn and Trevor’s place is amazing! Such a great getaway and a great way to reset. The river is refreshing and relaxing to sit by. If you walk up the river a little bit you will find some amazing little pools to sit in and listen to the stream. The “rock retreat” cottage was beautifully decorated and the bed was comfy. 10/10 recommend booking the gold river camp!
14140,878,"I spent last week in the River Rock Retreat cabin and I could not have felt more at home in the space Kathryn and Trevor created. The room was clean, beautifully decorated and very comfortable. It was glamping girls dream!"
14141,878,"Stay here! I’ve been In Airbnb locations around the world and this was by far my favorite experience. Great host and just an all around great place to be. Not having cell service was also a plus in my opinion, nothing to worry about except enjoying yourself. 10/10 experience"
14142,878,"We LOVED Gold River Camp. They thought of everything and it's the perfect place for these hot summer days. The camp is easy to find, only about 2 hours from Charlotte, and we were able to bring our dogs. We hope to come back in the fall and would highly recommend it!"
14143,878,Gold River camp was an amazing camping experience along with excellent host!! We look forward to telling friends and family. Everything to make a camping experience perfect and very clean restrooms/showers.
14144,878,"The little cabin was perfect for us! It's centrally located to a lot of great hikes, we used it mostly as a crash pad. Being so close to the river was really nice, our dog enjoyed splashing around! The communal bathrooms were spotless and the showers were amazing."
14145,878,Exactly as described and pictured. Make sure you read so you know if this place is for you!
14146,878,"You won’t find a couple that works harder for their guests, than these fine folks. Such an awesome camp! It was truly wonderful to kick back, and relax. I can’t wait to go back! 💞 Seret"
14147,878,Our stay with this host was EXCELLENT! Couldn't have asked for a better time. My wife and I were amazed by the owners obvious attention to detail. The location was convenient. The property was clean and the accommodations were comfortable! Highly recommended!
14148,878,"You won’t regret booking your stay here! We had the most relaxing time, being right on the river is so peaceful. Plenty of space to feel independent, and well maintained common areas to have the feeling of community. Great place, will definitely be back!"
14149,878,"Had the most wonderful time here! Me and my pup could not get enough of the river, playing ball and searching for rocks! Best camp bathrooms and showers that Iv ever experienced, they keep this place so beautifully clean! Very friendly hosts, willing to go above and beyond! Definitely intending to make it back this way as soon as possible, just to stay here again!!!"
14150,878,Can’t believe this mountain creek decor heaven exists! Absolute perfection and Kathryn and Trevor are so lovely and the dream hosts who love what they’ve created and sharing it with their guests !
14151,878,"I stayed here with my dog over Easter weekend, and it was such a great place value and location wise. It is located directly off a highway, so the cars zooming by can be kind of loud, but other than that everything else was perfect. The host was lightning fast with responses, the campground and the cabins are so clean and beautifully decorated, and if you’re an extrovert like me you’ll definitely make friends with the other people staying in some of the other cabins!"
14152,878,Wonderful get away
14153,878,"Highly recommend staying here! A refreshing step away from the overwhelming world we live in. What a sweet family too! I recommend bringing a box fax, griddle, electric tea kettle, microwaveable bowls, spoons/ forks. Don’t forget shower shoes, although it was all extremely clean and lovely. The bed was super comfy as well."
14154,878,"What an absolute beautiful weekend. Our stay was great and so relaxing. Kathryn, you truly made this weekend special for my now Fiancé 😀😀 We will definitely be back. 5 stars!!!!! Go ahead and book this stay NOW!! You will not be disappointed."
14155,878,We LOVED our stay and have already booked to go back in July. What a special place to visit.
14156,878,My fiancé and I loved the campground/cabins so much that we have decided to book at a later date for our wedding! Highly recommend a visit here!
14157,878,"A wonderful, cozy spot! The location provides easy access to plenty of activities and sights to see. The campground is also a nice spot to relax and unwind while sitting by the river with a cup of coffee. Will be back for sure!"
14158,878,"Very clean, great common areas and fire pits."
14159,878,I loved staying at Gold River Camp and will definitely come back!
14160,878,It was a Great get away
14161,878,"What an amazing find. This cabin was the most cozy and precious stay you could think of. The most perfect glamping experience with great common areas for lounging, hanging out by the fire, grilling, and more. Do not skip this stay if you are in the area. The town of Marion has more to it than I expected as well. Stop by the fiesty goldfish and Marion wing factory."
14162,878,It was one of the most beautiful stay we've been to. Really great and nice people. We had a great time and would definitely recommend.
14163,878,"Very convenient location, relaxing, clean, beautifully decorated!"
14164,878,We loved our stay! The places has everything you need to enjoy yourself. I loved the pavilion with books and fire we will be back for sure! Bathroom was always clean.
14165,878,The best place to go if you need to get away from everything in the world. The owners are a sweet young family who started this to share their world experiences with others.
14166,878,"We loved our stay at this amazing property! Looking for some of the camping experiences while still being comfortable at night and we definitely found the perfect compromise. The fire pits were fantastic and our go-to every night, and the rooms are so far beyond your standard “glamping” experience. Would absolutely visit again and highly recommend."
14167,878,The campground is very nice and the rooms are very cute! My dog and I went for a little getaway and she loved running around the property as well! We will definitely be back!
14168,878,Fantastic stay! I cannot wait to return with family and friends. This felt like an adult summer camp! 😊
14169,878,Dreamy spot! So much thought went into this place. Amazing. Highly recommend the cabins. Can't wait to go back.
14170,878,This is a great place to stay! It’s peaceful on-site and there’s lots to do there and nearby.
14171,878,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay on this well-thought-out property very much! We slept well in our comfy and spotless cabin, relaxed by the river, and hung out at one of the fire pits. It was the perfect getaway."
14172,878,"We enjoyed our stay here - the cabin is very well done and easy to find with Kathryn's exact instructions. Bathrooms are detached but very close by and clean/updated. The cabin site is right next to the river, easy access."
14173,878,I am glad to write about this gem. It is relatively new and the cabin we stayed and others we saw are very neat and tastefully decorated. The common shared bathhouse was modern and afforded privacy. You can tell this camp is a labor of love for the owners and it shows. They provide plenty of seating by the creek for peaceful enjoyment. I encourage everyone to give this place a try. The common night campfire give plenty of social time. They are right to warn you of no cell or internet but this is the type of place you go to get away from all that. Coverage is ok a couple of miles away if you can’t live without it.
14174,878,"I absolutely love this place, it was my second stay! The cabins are beautifully decorated, I feel like a princess! Then to sit and relax beside the river, true bliss! An amazing combination! We’ll done ♥️"
14175,878,Expect nothing short of an amazing stay!
14176,878,We absolutely loved our visit to Gold River Camp! The cabin was adorably decorated and very clean. We really appreciated that there were a variety of snacks and small items available in the vending machines. It is very evident that all the small details were considered. Kathryn was very responsive through messaging. We will definitely be back for more visits!
14177,878,"Gold River camp is magical! The space is lovely, the beds are comfortable, and the grounds are beautiful. Highly recommended!"
14178,878,Kathryn is a wonderful host and went above and beyond to make my stay cozy. I forgot towels and some cooking supplies and she lent both—the whole campground is a peaceful respite and every piece is beautifully curated! I hope to return.
14179,878,We stayed one night for our anniversary and this was absolutely the best place I have ever stayed. Beats a hotel room by far. I recommend it to everyone.
14180,878,"Loved this place, perfect for glamping and camping, cabins have just enough comforts of home set against the beautiful grounds, complete with trees, river, firepits, common area, hammocks, gas grills for cooking, lots of seating options, including cute, comfy, cozy sitting areas with sofas as well at a table & chairs and picnic tables to have meals, play games or just fellowship with others"
14181,878,"A great stay. Very peaceful and quiet. This place is very thoughtfully crafted cleaned well and owned by kind and friendly folks. Communal areas offer wonderful amenities, seating, fire pits, hammocks, and grills with propane/charcoal. You can choose your level of privacy with ease. The river rock “guest book” was so fun! Highly suggest a visit!"
14182,878,A fun outdoors place to stay while your in the area.
14183,878,"So cozy & adorable! Our cabin was beautifully decorated. We loved getting to bring our dog as she was a HUGE fan of the river & sandy beach area.
My family & I will be planning a trip to return!"
14184,878,"Great comfy accents throughout the site—hammocks, fire pits, places to sit, and eat what snacks you have.

Also, running water on the River crested a great wading. Respite from the heat.

Clean bathrooms and shower stalls."
14185,878,"This is a beautiful little area on the River. It has lots of personality and special little touches. Kathryn was awesome at recommending places to eat and hike. On her recommendation, we hiked to Crabtree Falls and it was amazing. The only thing I would note, is to be aware that if your room doesn't contain a bathroom this means toilet as well. This may seem like common sense, but for some reason it didn't dawn on us until we arrived. We expected to use the shower house (which was very large and clean), but didnt think about having to use the toilet there as well. Overall, we enjoyed ourselves and hope to visit again soon."
14186,878,"My girlfriend and I had the perfect stay with Kathryn! She is super friendly and chatted to us about the property over a meal. The outdoor area was beautiful and our room was lovely. The campground is so cozy as well as the cabin. We had a fantastic time cooking by the fire and exploring the river. We already plan on coming back! There are plenty of activities on site, it’s the perfect place for a getaway or to bring the kids. So much thought was put into this place and you can really tell. Thank you Kathryn and family!!!"
14187,878,"Great place. Cabins are comfy and cozy. Ammenities were clean. Cooling down in the river, the pavalion and fire pits are a plus!!"
14188,878,"Kathryn is a real super host! The area is super pretty and prepared with a lot of love. My little cabin looked exactly like the pictures and there was nothing missing. Toilets and showers are super clean, just like everything else.
A great place for families with young children, but also for romantics."
14189,925,We selected this loft for a girls' weekend. It was a gorgeous space. Everything was exceptionally clean. Erin was extremely responsive when we had a question. It is a great space!
14190,925,We loved our stay at the loft. The pictures do not it justice. The beds were comfortable and the place was clean. Great location. Within walking distance to restaurants and shops. We will definitely be back!
14191,925,"Very clean. Walkable to everything in Bryson City. Beautiful loft. If I had to complain about one thing, there were several incense all around the house and the strong smells were a bit over powering. Otherwise, great stay."
14192,925,"We only dealt with Danny. It actually looked better than the pics - after reading some reviews I was worried but they must have just wanted to gripe. Can’t please everyone all of the time. It’s huge! Prepare for cooler 1st floor -warmer second floor- pretty simple heat rises! We handled by using only the fan and no heat. The master bath is a whole huge room so of course it’s cool. We walked to everything just about. Such a handy place. We would stay again. Our friends cancelled so just two of us paid a bit too much but if we had divided the cost it would have been very reasonable. The TV is limited to satellite , I emailed Danny and he told me what to do. The town is quaint and this place is also. Don’t be scared off by reviews - take them all into consideration."
14193,925,A wonderful stay! Special touches made it feel very special. Wonderful parking and was able to walk to everything in Bryson City.
14194,925,Overall experience was outstanding it was a really cool place to stay everything was in walking distance and was a cool little town.
14195,925,"This may be the coolest place I’ve stayed with Airbnb. It’s a loft in an old commercial building that’s been converted to a beautiful living space. It’s above a tax service office in Downtown Bryson City. From this location, you can be at the railroad ticket booth in abt a 2 minute or less walk if you’re in town to ride the train. I don’t think there is a closer place to stay to ride it. If you’re wanting to explore Downtown, you can start at this place and literally make a circle of Everett Street down one side of the street and back on the other side. It has a nice balcony over the street too."
14196,925,This place is awesome. A little pricey but right downtown and you get what you pay for!!!
14197,925,We had the best time staying at the Loft. Great location to the Polar Express and very cozy. We loved the added Christmas touch. We will absolutely book again.
14198,925,Great
14199,925,"I’m convinced we were in a hallmark movie! This town is the epitome of Christmas and pictures don’t do it justice. Christmas lights on all the buildings, people walking around in Christmas pajamas, and hot chocolate everywhere you look.

The Loft was absolutely the perfect location to everything. The train station was 1 block away and multiple shops and restaurants were also within a 4 block radius.

The loft was more gorgeous and spacious than imagined! The place was decorated gorgeous with Christmas decor that included a Christmas tree, Christmas bedding, and had the Grinch/Polar Express movie out for a movie night.

I will say that if you’re sleeping in the bottom room, you can hear EVERYTHING outside of the room so if you’re light sleepers take that into account. Otherwise, everything was great and we had such a great experience."
14200,925,"Danny and the team made our stay so great. We were there to take our small grandkids to Polar Express and the apartment was only a short stroll a block to the train station. Downtown is beautiful and is a must to walk through and see all the stores and diners and coffee shops. Have to go to the bakeries, deli, coffee shop and Everett Diner, as well as the Loose Moose and McClannahan's. Also, Smith's Dry goods for boots, jackets or other items. There are too many to mention for sure. You need several days to really take it in.

The apartment is so nice and well-stocked. Beautiful rustic furniture, very roomy and the beds and baths are perfect. The balcony has several chairs and tables to relax and have coffee or cocktails and view the comings and goings of the town. I have to say that Bryson City is one the most friendly towns we've been to in our travels and you'll not find a stranger there.

Can't wait to get back up there and see everyone again."
14201,925,"Very nice, spacious, easy walk to train in town. Tub was missing ability to close off to hold water. Law office down stairs began running vacuum at 6am . Noise of trash trucks and delivery trucks loud in bedroom starting at 4am."
14202,925,"Amazing loft, everything was beautiful and clean! Super spacious. Perfect location to everything yet private and secluded feeling. We loved our stay and will be back!"
14203,925,"We loved our stay in this loft. We've stayed on a different property by this owner before, so we had an idea of what to expect, and we were not disappointed! The loft was expertly decorated, including a Christmas tree and festive bed linens. It is located right in the heart of the town- within walking distance to all the cute shops and the train station. We stayed for our ride on the Polar Express, and it was so nice to be able to walk to dinner, our train ride, and breakfast the next morning. We were also close enough that we could run back and drop off our purchases, so we didn't have to carry them around all night. There were great dining options within walking distance, and parking/check-in was easy breezy. We had a great time and will definitely stay with this host again."
14204,925,The loft was very pretty. There was even a Christmas tree! The beds were comfortable and the kitchen was stocked enough for us. Paper supplies were plentiful. Only downside was the loft got very hot even with the upstairs A/C running and the downstairs heat turned down. Location was excellent for walking to town.
14205,925,Great place to stay for riding the Polar Express!
14206,925,Perfect Polar Express lodging!
14207,925,Charming getaway at the end of the Main Street! Making dining and shopping just a few steps away.
14208,925,This place is one of a kind and such a gem! The owners are wonderful and I can’t express how much I appreciate them. I will be back!
14209,925,Absolutely loved this place! The beds are very comfortable. The bathroom is huge with great mirrors for doing makeup! Very clean and in the perfect spot! We will definitely visit again. Chris & Lacee Hall
14210,925,One of the best AirBnB’s we’ve stayed in! The location is perfect for exploring Bryson City and Western NC. We loved being right downtown and the porch with a beautiful Mountain View overlooking the town was an added bonus. The beds were super comfy and the TV with access to the SEC Network was the icing on top (this is fall in the South after all…we can’t miss a game 😁). All of this and only 5 minutes to great hiking in the Smokies! We definitely hope to stay here again one day!
14211,925,Amazing space is a charming city! Wonderful location with a warm welcome from the owners.
14212,925,Perfect place in perfect location. Walk everywhere. Beds were so comfy and the place was very clean. Can’t say enough good things about Erin’s loft! Loved breakfast and coffee on the balcony with great view of the mountains.
14213,925,"This loft is so beautiful, a modern rustic feel. We have stayed twice, and plan to return next year for our visit to Bryson City before we head to Sevierville. They are at the quiet end of the lovely main street of bryson city.. so you can walk to the coffee shop , then browse the cute boutiques or watch the smoky mtn railroad come in. We like to sit on the balcony at sunset and enjoy cupcakes from the local bakery. There is plenty of parking for our van and trailer."
14214,925,"We’re so enjoyed our stay in your Bryson City Loft - perfect location, beautiful loft, loved the decor and and how roomy it all is, and so many special touches to welcome us (locally apples, honey, cold bottled water, and even candy and a dvd for our very own movie night!) We all loved the balcony outside - the comfy outdoor chairs and tables were perfect for people watching and morning coffee. Highly recommend!
Literally a block from the GSMR station, walk to restaurants shops and everything!
Just a few small things would’ve made it even more perfect:
Maybe a small bench in the upstairs bathroom for toiletries (and to use at the sink for styling hair and applying makeup for the female guest since the mirror is mounted a little low) as well as a shower curtain (tension rod style would be just fine). Having a couple heavy duty decorative hooks to hang clothes on hangers in the upstairs loft style bedroom would be helpful.
Having either a darker stained glass in the empty transom over the bathroom door in the downstairs bedroom would help with both privacy for whoever is in the bathroom and in the middle of the night it would help for those going to the bathroom not to wake the person still in bed from light coming in through that same opening.
Also a few walk coat rack hooks where the photo board is when entering the building would be helpful.
We do wish the fireplace would have been working for this first cold weekend, but it wasn’t necessary at all.
Thank you for having us we had a blast!!"
14215,925,"This place is perfect!! Gorgeous, clean, and location perfect! Erin thought of everything we could possibly need and left little personal touches which is totally neat. We would recommend to anyone!!! Thank you for sharing your place."
14216,925,It's a great place to stay and the location is perfect.
14217,925,"Place is awesome and clean, location is perfect and you can walk anywhere you want with ease, the TV situation is not good. Only stayed one night but it would be nice if we could log into our personal YouTube, Netflix or Amazon, account. Owner has this locked out and you have to go back in time and watch commercials. The road is very noisy so be prepared to hear lots of motorcycles which is common in small NC towns."
14218,925,"We loved staying in the Oconaluftee loft! Everything was perfect and we loved the location. We can’t wait to come back.

Ps-We had no issues with the AC."
14219,925,"Highly recommend! Perfectly located. Easy walk to anything in town including train depot, river, restaurants, and breweries. Clean, beautiful space with ample room and great balcony."
14220,925,"Fantastic place. Location was fantastic for exploring downtown. Lots of parking. The space is really open and not cramped at all. Nice balcony/porch with railing facing the main street in BC but not right in the middle of the hustle and bustle. Note one bedroom is a loft only (meaning no door/full wall for pricavy) but not a concern for us, just not idea for sound barrier or kids. HUGE master bathroom with sooo much space. Well stocked with disposable supplies (trash bags, detergent, paper towels, coffee). Check in was a breeze. No issues with neighbors or sounds. You will hear the train in the distanw but that is literally anywhere in Bryson City, its not directly outside your window. We would definitely stay here again for another girlfriends trip with our dogs! (there is ample space to walk dogs too! and pretty fountain and flower garden outside)"
14221,925,This place is wonderful! My sister and I and both of my girls stayed a couple of nights and the location couldn’t have been better! We didn’t move the car all weekend. We especially enjoyed the balcony even with the inevitable road noise 😕 we hope to stay again maybe close to Christmas!
14222,925,"This property is perfectly located and a beautiful loft They are resting on those laurels to scrape by with everything else. Poorly stocked kitchen with a broken cook top, meager towels in the bathrooms, a toilet that didn't work right, entertainment center that didn't function well (had to play battery shuffle on remotes) AC issues where only the main room was tolerable the rest got above 80 at some points. Had to sweat it out on the living room couches to sleep at night because the bedrooms were stifling. Had to ask for help on issues several times since they had no welcome book with instructions on house use/check out protocol. AC issue could not be solved. The $400 plus price tag I paid per night should have been an exceptional luxury visit not a couch surfing frustrating sweat house."
14223,925,The place is in great location and beautiful place. However AC doesnt work in downstairs room no matter of the setting and upstairs room bathroom flush had an issue.
14224,964,"Close to the arts district, clean and easy check in and check out. Like a studio, but nice open space and very modern. No elevator, so keep that in mind if you get booked on the third floor."
14225,964,"I had a good, comfortable stay. Communication with the host was easy and quick!"
14226,964,It was what we expected. Thank you for this opportunity. We’ll be back.
14227,964,Beautiful and easy to check in and check out!
14228,964,"Everything about the stay was great. The flat was spotless, beautiful, and comfortable. Great bed. Great bathroom with lovely soaps, lighting, linens. Full kitchen had everything I needed. The wonderful host left me 2 days of excellent local coffee, some chocolate and candy, even a sweet little Valentines gift and note. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and will definitely be back."
14229,964,"in town for a local event, River Row Flats was conveniently located to the venue, and easily accessible to the highway."
14230,964,Everything was super clean and comfortable! We loved the location in the arts district but also super close to downtown. Would definitely stay again.
14231,964,Great stay! We will be returning!
14232,964,Super cute and very clean! This studio was the perfect spot for our brief stay in Asheville. Would definitely recommend.
14233,964,"Really love the location! Close to the arts district, downtown, lots of restaurants and shops."
14234,964,"We came to Asheville for 2 consecutive concerts downtown. I have only stayed in downtown proper before, this was the first time in River Arts District. Looking across the street is a brewery (an unusual view) so at first I was taken aback . However as it turned out, I enjoyed staying in the district very much! We only went into the bustling DT for the shows, otherwise we decided to really enjoy the Arts District. Everything- even DT- is just a short 4-8 minutes drive or Uber. We found the location to be peaceful, friendly, and cultured with its own excellent restaurants and cafes. The apartment has everything you need and is spotless. The cleaning staff I saw on the property were really friendly and they should be commended. If you love checking out work of local artists, sculptors, painters and artisans as well as downtown I would recommend it."
14235,964,We stayed at this flat while visiting Asheville for a concert at the Salvage Station. It was less than a mile from the venue so it was really convenient. The unit was very clean! We heard very little noise from our neighbors and overall was a very peaceful stay. Liked the shampoo/conditioner/body wash containers in the shower which saved us packing space. The checkin process was super easy and the unit was ready at the promised time. We will definitely be back.
14236,964,Great place
14237,964,"Nice place, this is a third floor walk up with no stairs and the unit name / number is in the title.
Other than that, this is a very clean place, well kept up."
14238,964,Great location- very clean place
14239,964,"Great place to stay while visiting Asheville, NC!"
14240,964,"Clean, great location across from New Belgium Brewery, quiet, easy no contact checkin."
14241,964,"The location of our stay was close to downtown and walking distance to a few restaurants. Communication was fantastic and the check in was easy and effective. There was an ant concern, other than that it was fine. Recommended for a quick stay!"
14242,964,Spacious and modern rooms. Close to restaurants and the downtown area.
14243,964,"Great place to stay if you don't mind being a little out of the downtown area. Hole Doughnuts for breakfast, hiking during the day, dinner downtown and drinks at Burger Bar (walking distance) was our recipe for a good time."
14244,964,Really cool building in a “close to everything” location! It had everything you needed for a short term rental!!
14245,964,Easy walking distance to New Belgium and other amenities. The room was very comfortable and clean.
14246,964,We loved our stay at this location! Located right near the river arts district and just a short drive (less than 5 minutes) from downtown. The apartment was perfect for our almost week long stay! Plenty of room for the two of us to enjoy ourselves. Next time we’re in AVL we plan on staying here again!!
14247,964,Great spot to unwind in Asheville easy check in great location
14248,964,Exceptionally clean. Everything was in great condition. Well stocked and supplied fresh coffee. Convenient to everything. Responsive host. We would absolutely stay again. Thank you!
14249,964,"Overall a decent place. Wifi is advertised as 200mbps, but speedtest.net was averaging 40 mbit download and 20 mbit upload. During most days, we were able to get uber/lyft to downtown Asheville."
14250,964,"Space is very bright (big windows) and clean! Love the location across from New Belgium Brewery and River Arts District (walking distance across the river). Unit had a fully stocked kitchen for those who want to cook! Only issue for us was the wifi seemed unreliable; for our few nights there, we were unable to stream any shows/movies - so factor this in accordingly for how you like to unwind.

Would return again to explore the local art, river walks and take an art class."
14251,964,Fantastic stay! Great communication with host. Convenient to everything Asheville has to offer.
14252,964,awesome location across the street from New Belgium brewery and within walking distance to white duck taco and the Salvage Station music venue.
14253,964,"Just as described... lovely room, super clean and cozy!"
14254,964,We had a great time in Asheville and recommend River Row Flats. Plenty of room and a good location right across the street from New Belgium.
14255,964,Great location. Right across the street from New Belgium Brewing.
14256,964,"This apartment is perfectly located if you want to explore the River Arts District. We stay in Asheville every year on our way to the beach and this was definitely the best location and the best value we’ve found in many years. Communication was great, the space was immaculate, and there was ample parking. Highly recommend!"
14257,964,"Great location that's comfortably removed from the touristy parts of Asheville. Just our speed. It's within easy walking distance of the wonderful River Arts District galleries. We had fun at nearby attractions: New Belgium, White Duck Tacos, and The Guitar Bar. Easy driving distance to downtown and West Asheville. The place is nice and clean. Plenty of room for two. Everything worked well except the TV. But we didn't go on vacation to watch TV, so no big loss."
14258,964,"Great value, location, and accuracy. Very short walking distance to breweries and the River Arts District. A rare find in the area for its cost and kitchen appliances- was full of every utensil you could want."
14259,964,Absolutely amazing place which I highly recommend for anyone !
14260,964,would highly recommend this place and the location was perfect. don’t leave your bikes outside as ours were stolen the first night however not the fault of river row flats. will definitely be back to the great city of Asheville
14261,964,Great stay! We’ll definitely be back!!!
14262,964,Great proximity to downtown and River Arts District. Perfectly convenient for hiking and hitting up breweries. Was great to have a full kitchen and space to relax during our visit to Asheville. Would recommend!
14263,964,"Interesting area of Asheville, lovely to have the River walk nearby. Unit is well and thoughtfully appointed. At the time of our stay, restaurants were very good in the immediate neighborhood, but somewhat limited by COVID restrictions. Would stay at this site again."
14264,964,Excellent customer service.
14265,964,The apartment is always so spotlessly clean and has the best hospitality. Anything you could need is available. The place is stylish but simple and so comfortable. It’s only a short ride to downtown Asheville. Our keypad was broken the day of our arrival but our host contacted us in advance to make other arrangements. We stay here every time we visit Asheville.
14266,964,The location of these flats in West AVL cannot be beat. It was a perfect landing pad for our quick adventure.
14267,964,Nice place
14268,964,"When you enter the space you’re pleasantly surprised that it looks just like it does online.

The bathroom was well updated and spacious’
The kitchen has everything that you’ll need and the appliances are updated as well.
The bed is super comfy and the view is spectacular! You won’t be disappointed."
14269,964,Amazing weekend spot in asheville
14270,964,"Very nice, clean and well located."
14271,964,Myself and two others stayed at River Row Flats and had a great experience! Perfect location to either drive or uber downtown Asheville as well as driving for hikes. The AirBnB was very clean and it made easy to check-in and check out. I would recommend this to anyone who wanted to stay in Asheville for a few days!
14272,964,"The most amazing air bnb I've EVER stayed at (and I've stayed a lot of air bnb's). The place felt like a hotel: sparkling clean, best amenities, great location in River Arts, and local tips. I didn't want to leave! Recommend to any and everyone visiting Asheville."
14273,964,Great spot.
14274,964,Great location and great value.
14275,964,The room was professionally managed. It’s super clean. I highly recommend to stay with them.
14276,964,"Great location, clean, comfortable. I recommend 100%"
14277,964,"Great Location!! Wonderful area to walk around River Arts District, right around corner from West Asheville, and across street from New Belgium Brewery!!!"
14278,964,Great spot! Location is perfect and it had everything we needed. Will definitely stay here again.
14279,964,"This was a perfect location for the things my husband and I planned to do while in Asheville. It is right across New Belgium Brewing and they have a different food truck every day so that is in walking distance. French Broad River Greenway is also across the street which is a walking path. Everything was incredibly clean. I believe these flats are very new, so it smelled brand new. She leaves complimentary local coffee for you, which was a thoughtful incentive. Easy to find, parking private and felt safe. The only reason I am marking this as 4 stars is because we were given the incorrect keypad code, but she did answer immediately and it was fixed within minutes. The walls were very thin and we heard our neighbor all week, the conditioner bottle in the shower did not work, and the internet would not connect to my Roku that I brought. Overall, it was a great stay and a beautiful apartment."
14280,964,"Very nearly a complete place for my family. Location is gold, across from Asheville's most stunning brewery. Well managed and cleaner than most places this style."
14281,964,"Definitely recommend, the rental looks just like the pictures! The location is prefect if you would like to access the river and explore the city. Everything we needed or wanted to do was 6-10 mins away."
14282,964,"We loved staying at River Row Flats! Great location, super clean, and exceeded all of our expectations! Will definitely stay here again while we are in Asheville!"
14283,964,Great place and great area to stay in Asheville.
14284,964,"Place was amazing, clean and a great location. Quick response and friendly staff. One down side was that I was here when everything had just got shut down for the Corona virus so I didn't get to enjoy much but my stay was still amazing here."
14285,964,This place is clean and stylish! Great location close to west Asheville and across street from New Belgium Brewery. No downfalls at all except thin walls and could hear loud toddler next door until early hours.
14286,964,Terrific place. Will be staying here again in the future.
14287,964,Such a wonderful space nestled into a perfect location!! Close to all the best places you'll want to go to!! Easy check in/ out. AND there's a full kitchen!! We travel everywhere and it's hard to find a kitchen!!! 10 thumbs up!!
14288,964,"We had an issue checking in because the keypad code didn’t work. However, the host was quick to respond & provided a new code within minutes. Clean, spacious, stylish."
14289,964,Great location and price close to the action of Asheville. Will definitely stay here again next time we are up that way!
14290,964,"River Row Flats was a very modern, hotel-like stay in a great location. Everything was very clean and sleek, and they had left a couple nice touches like local chocolate and coffee. The bed was comfortable and it was a great size room! A couple of things that could have been better were the WiFi (didn’t work well during certain times of the day), and they listed a crib as an optional amenity but it was a Pack ‘n Play (still a great amenity to offer, but our baby doesn’t sleep well in anything but a crib so it was a little disappointing). Overall, this was a great place to stay for a short trip to Asheville!"
14291,964,Awesome place! Would definitely rent again!!
14292,964,Very nice place with everything needed to enjoy your stay
14293,964,"Very nice place in a great location... although River Row Flats is basically a hotel without a front desk or elevator. It was easy to check in, however, once in the room we noticed a strong chemical/adhesive odor (probably due to recent construction) - we kept the sliding door open almost the entire visit due to the smell. There we were a few ants in the kitchen but it had recently rained (an they promptly offered to come spray for them). Mattress was uncomfortable. The safety light in the corridor outside the front door (which was frosted glass) allowed a significant amount of light to enter the room at night - we were informed that shades have been ordered to correct this issue. Lastly, the internet didn't work perfectly at night... say past 8PM (unable to stream Netflix on the TV).

Overall, this was quite a nice place but I probably wouldn't book this location again."
14294,1005,"Wonderful Cabin, clean, responsive and respectful host. Print directions and try to check in during daylight!! Lol"
14295,1005,Great cabin and great location. We plan on returning in the future. Highly recommended.
14296,1005,It’s a very nice cabin with all of the amenities you want on vacation. Very easy instructions. Very quiet and peaceful.
14297,1005,"What a wonderful place....beautiful view, deck and hot tub, outdoor fireplace, and well appointed, rustic cabin in the mountains! The entire cabin was freshly cleaned. We found the sofa and beds to be very comfortable. We particularly appreciated ample towels and wash clothes, as well as plenty of hooks in the bathroom. Everything you need for general cooking was found in the kitchen. This was a lovely stay! A word to the wise--PRINT out the directions to the cabin. Network services are spotty at best and you cannot depend on your phone and GPS to find the cabin. Also, the last several miles to the cabin are on typical mountain roads--narrow, steep, dirt roads with some sharp turns. Our Subarus did great!"
14298,1005,"This was a very nice stay for me and my friend. Extremely peaceful, you’ll be at the top of the mountain so no traffic or people :) The house was very clean and welcoming, would definitely stay here again!"
14299,1005,Clean and cozy cabin. Perfect for a relaxing getaway. Joe was very helpful and responsive to any concerns. The only issue was is if it’s colder the hot tub can take 1-2 days to heat up. It unfortunately didn’t heat up before we had to check out so we weren’t able to use it. Something to keep in mind if you plan to go in the winter.
14300,1005,"For our first vacation as a family of four this cabin in the woods was a perfect getaway for our family to connect, relax, and have some fun! We will absolutely be back."
14301,1005,Joe’s place was amazing! We really enjoyed being out in nature and the use of the hot tub in this cold weather. Hoping to stay there again sometime soon!
14302,1005,It was a peaceful stay. The wood stove made the space very warm. No complaints whatsoever.
14303,1005,Great for a quiet weekend getaway!
14304,1005,"It was what I wanted, secluded, back in nature, bunnies, chipmunks , squirrels, birds trees mountains, hot tub, fireplace, nice quite walks. Clean, had everything needed for homemade meals and I even baked fresh bread. Little scary on the way up if you are not used to step mountain driving. But it was well worth the effort to get up there. Not too bad. Doable."
14305,1005,"Great spot in the mountains and a very rustic feel!

Make sure to download the directions before as you won’t have service until getting on the house Wi-Fi."
14306,1005,Great retreat up on a mountain side where the air is much cooler than down in Burnsville. Perfect place to escape heat & crowds.
14307,1005,"Super cute little cabin! Very clean, very cozy! A little bit of a terrifying drive if you arrive at night because the roads and the driveway are very steep and narrow, but that’s to be expected in the mountains. Very secluded and beautiful mountain surroundings. Gorgeous in the spring when all the flowering trees are in bloom. It had a nice kitchen and wood stove, a tiny little washer/dryer combo if you’re staying more than a few days and need to run a load or two. It could’ve used some extra blankets and pillows, and we looked, but couldn’t find any. All in all it was a great place to stay. Highly recommend! Will most likely go back someday."
14308,1005,Immaculate cabin in the most peaceful mountain setting! Comfortable and cozy. We would definitely stay again.
14309,1005,The cabin was wonderful. Highly recommend.
14310,1005,This home is lovely. We enjoyed our stay.
14311,1005,"The very enjoyable cabin in a quiet neck of the woods. Loved the wood stove. The cabin has basic needs, very simplistic. Make sure to have directions prior to check in date! Our GPS took us on your of the neighborhood before we found it. Good view through the trees of the sunset(s). We saw a coyote the first night."
14312,1005,The cabin has a well-stocked kitchen with plenty of pots/pans/ and dishes. Beds were comfortable and the deck outside is a nice touch. The location is great--close to the Pisgah National Park for hiking and Burnsville for restaurants and grocery stores.
14313,1005,"The house was perfect and the location was absolutely stunning! So peaceful and the views were amazing! So happy we chose Joe’s place! What a lovely weekend getaway, we can’t thank you enough"
14314,1005,Exactly what we needed for a winter getaway with the pups.
14315,1005,Host was great. Place was nice and clean. Beautiful area. Great value.
14316,1012,"This is a lovely rental--well appointed and, with two full bathrooms, perfect for me and my friend to share. (It would be great for two couples.) We enjoyed the porch, the peace, and the proximity to Pisgah National Forest trails. We would happily return."
14317,1012,Great location to Brevard and DuPont and Pisgah Forests. It was a very comfortable place surrounded by woods.
14318,1012,"I know it’s named “the green haven”, but for our family, it’s become “the little green house in the woods.” This is our second trip back, and words just can’t really capture the family memories we’ve made here over our two visits. After our first visit, our four kids asked us over and over again this past year to come back - and we are so incredibly glad we did!

We love the outdoors - and staying here puts us right next to DuPont and Pisgah Forests (and lots of trails and waterfalls). Coming back after a day of family outdoor adventures, it is always so nice to be welcomed by the little green house. This year, we even had some great times around the fire pit at night as a family - a great addition since our last visit!

It’s restful here. In the mornings, my daughter and I like to hang our hammocks in the trees below and drink coffee/hot chocolate while talking about life and watching the sun rise. We smile when the rooster next door crows and the horse from the pasture below wanders up to say hello. My son really loves the cozy blankets and couch inside in the early mornings.

My wife and I love sitting on the front patio - just soaking in the mountains, country, and fresh air. Life seems to slow briefly here…and we find refreshment. The hearts of our family just seem to come alive being here in the mix of outdoor adventure and rest.

The hosts are wonderful, gracious, and kind. They are quick to respond to questions and comments you have…and bless you with good coffee from a local roaster in town. The house is well equipped with what you need, and sleeps our family of six well.

After our adventures the last few days, the kids are already starting to say, “Well…when we come back next time, we need to do….”

This little green house in the woods has really won our family over. Thanks Leigh again for hosting us. — If you are a family considering here, I highly recommend booking. I hope you make some great memories here as well!"
14319,1012,You guys are wonderful! We found so much joy when we lived there and so thankful others can find respite from the crazy day to day and rest with their family! Please come visit us again - you are welcome any time!!
14320,1012,"This place is such a hidden gem! We got in pretty late after a long car ride, and it was very refreshing to see how clean and comfortable the house was. Leigh was super quick with any communication and was very helpful! The location is conveniently close to both waterfall hikes and the cute downtown of brevard. It was perfect for the 4 of us, we would definitely stay again!"
14321,1012,"The Green Haven had all the essential items our family needed for our week-long stay in the mountains. The location was great, everything was clean, and the view from the porch was absolutely beautiful and our favorite part of the place. Leigh was helpful along the way with anything that was needed. We had such a nice stay.

There were a couple of things that surprised us about the property that may be helpful to know: the upstairs bedroom doesn't have a door (our young daughter slept there and wasn't a problem for us). The property below had a somewhat shared driveway and several cars parked in the valley area throughout our stay which we weren't expecting. This may not always be the case, but figured I'd mention it in case it is.

Overall we would recommend and would stay again. Thank you!"
14322,1012,"Thank you, Kristie for your review! The upstairs is a suite with its own bathroom but does not have a door before you walk down the stairs, however, there is no exposure to downstairs guests walking by and the entire upstairs is a suite. Also, regarding the shared driveway, we have never had anyone mention this! There is one neighbor who also uses the road that dead ends into his property where he works on some cars but has never been an issue with us nor any prior guests as the view from the deck is beautiful and the property is tucked away and private. Thanks again for staying with us and hope y'all had safe travels home!"
14323,1012,Leigh’s cabin is in a convenient location to explore the hiking in the area. The house is comfortable and clean.
14324,1012,"This is the perfect place to stay! If you are looking to get into Pisgah National Forest or simply enjoy all that Brevard has to offer, consider staying here. Despite being close to everything, the house feels private and set apart."
14325,1012,Cute and cozy house. Great place to stay for easy access to riding and hiking in Pisgah forest.
14326,1012,"Great location and wonderful place if your you work remotely.

Leigh was a wonderful host and I had everything that was needed."
14327,1012,"We had a relaxing time at the house. The location just minutes from the highway made it convenient to explore the area, but still retain an out-in-the-country feel. The house was clean, bright, and comfortable. We appreciate that it’s uncluttered and had still had what we needed. The coffee Leigh left us was a treat!"
14328,1012,A great location. Private and convenient. Clean and well designed/appointed/supplied. Perfect for Pisgah Forest activities. Check-in and out was seamless and Leigh was very responsive. Highly recommended and will try to return soon. Jeff Wilmoth
14329,1012,"Great host, nice touch with youtube driving directions! Watching the fireflies at night was amazing and close to Pisgah Forest, Brevard and Blue Ridge Parkway."
14330,1012,"Everyone in our group was well pleased with the Green Haven vacation rental. Scenic location, pristine cleanliness, great communication from Leigh before arrival, a real nice experience. Wouldn't hesitate at all to make a return visit."
14331,1012,"Green Haven is a nice place, clean and accessible to everything.."
14332,1012,Had a wonderful stay. Everything was clean and great location to Dupont and Pisgah Forest.
14333,1012,"Wonderful house in a prime location to nearby hiking, fishing, and swimming. Clean, private, comfortable, and in a beautiful mountain setting. Loved our stay and would definitely recommend and visit again."
14334,1012,Lovely place with wonderful outdoor spaces (porch and lawn w firepit) with views to the mountains and spacious and airy inside. Very close to main Pisgah entrance.
14335,1012,"This place is cute, cozy and inviting. I highly recommend staying. It’s a green haven for sure. We enjoyed the front porch and plan to come back."
14336,1012,"The GreenHaven is exactly as described and pictured! A very tranquil place, we enjoyed the porch in the evenings. Beautiful treed property, with a great view. Good location, off the beaten track but close enough to lots of things to do! We hiked in Pisgah Forest, and off the BRMP, and enjoyed the local Farmers market on Saturday morning (even bought some fresh trout). Had some good food and beer at local spots too. The kitchen was well equipped, we appreciated the stock of spices! Leigh was available for a couple of questions we had, we appreciated her quick response."
14337,1012,"Amazing place very near to Pisgah National Forest. The house is cute, clean, very comfortable and functional. I recommend it very highly!"
14338,1012,We absolutely loved our stay here! So beautiful and peaceful yet close to town as well! Our favorite part was just sitting on the front porch and enjoying the beautiful views! Definitely would love to come back and stay again!
14339,1012,"Wow! We loved our stay at Green Haven! It was just the right size for our family and so convenient to downtown Brevard and Pisgah Ntl Forest - took us less than 10 minutes! We also loved the view from the front porch, very nice!"
14340,1012,"Not that we want to give away a good secret, but if you are mountain bikers and like to bike at Dupont or Pisgah, this house cannot be in a better location. It is barely 15 minutes to Dupont and even closer to Pisgah Forest. Same is true if you like craft beer, your kids need a playground or two or three, and if Asheville is more your speed it is an easy 30 minute drive. It is quiet, the house is impeccably clean and has what you need to cook or grill. The owners are friendly and very responsive. We will be back again!"
14341,1012,"The Green Haven is in the perfect location and minutes away from Pisgah, Dupont, and biking trails. Leigh was quick to respond and had a professional and friendly tone. We had terrific, hot showers. There were five of us, and there was plenty of hot water even for the last to take a shower.

They have a big yard that our three kids played in each day. But, even though the yard is big, there are still neighbors close by. Leigh provided some local coffee which was a surprise. We had a great time and made some great memories."
14342,1012,"Thank you, Joseph! You all were a pleasure to host and welcome back any day! We hope you will visit our mountains again soon :)"
14343,1012,Such a sweet and cozy house! I highly recommend this house and the hosts! We came in from out of town and they were very accommodating and helpful with our arrival plans. The house was super clean and perfect for our weekend getaway. Location was great and property was quiet and peaceful. We will definitely be back!
14344,1012,very nice and peaceful place. The place was clean and location was very convenient.
14345,1012,"a magical, cozy, private place to stay... could not have pick a better place to stay with my family... we all loved the place, very clean and it has everything you need..

(It would have to say though that the living room area may need some courtains to give that feeling of privacy, just an observation)

Thank you Family for sharing your beautiful place, you have done such a heavenly place.."
14346,1012,"Thank you, Nancy! We left the windows open due to the privacy of the land and to let the natural light come through but thank you for the suggestion. So glad your family had nice trip, safe travels home from NC!"
14347,1012,Absolutely beautiful home ..in an absolutely tranquil environment. Very clean and modern ... Everything we needed for the perfect getaway. Do not look further....book immediately!!!!
14348,1012,It was a beautiful weekend at a beautiful house!
14349,1012,"Green Haven was a super spot for our Thanksgiving holiday. It was plenty of space for our family of four, and was 20 minutes close to DuPont and Pisgah - the two spots we spent our days. It was well outfitted with the basics for cooking and eating - well enough that we were able to finish cooking our Thanksgiving dinner! Beds were comfortable and it was clean, quiet, and exactly as described. We will be back!"
14350,1012,Leigh’s place was fantastic. The cabin was quiet and very clean - exactly what we needed!
14351,1012,This is an excellent choice! Our family wanted a peaceful vacation full of outdoor activities and this place suited us so well. Our hosts were super helpful - answering questions we had prior to arrival and providing a YouTube video on how to reach their place. The house was clean and comfy - with patio space to enjoy the fall colors and early morning sunrises. We were close to two forests with plenty of waterfalls and hiking trails - and we took advantage of them! Our kids are already talking about wanting to return again soon - we made such good family memories there! I highly recommend staying here for future outdoor adventurers!!!
14352,1012,Thank you so much for your kind words! So thankful your family was able to enjoy these beautiful fall colors - perfect timing! Wish you all the best and thank you for being such great guests!
14353,1012,A great stay convenient to DuPont and Pisgah. Very clean and modern unit.
14354,1012,A roomy and stylish cottage with great views
14355,1012,Beautiful spot! Feels secluded but close enough to some really great areas - both eating/breweries and hiking spots. So relaxing and very quiet. Perfect little getaway.
14356,1012,Host was prompt with replies and helpful with questions about the area. Home was perfect for our vacation- clean and all the amenities we needed.. Close to Brevard and hiking in Dupont and Pisgah forests.
14357,1012,Perfect little getaway! We enjoyed the coziness and quietness of this sweet home. It's only 10-15 minutes from downtown Brevard or a nice hike. We'd definitely recommend hiking Bridal Falls -- so beautiful!
14358,1012,This is our second time staying at The Green Haven; we like the quick access to Pisgah National Forest.
14359,1012,"This place is amazing! Tucked away in a secluded and scenic area, but still close to town and extremely close to some great mountain biking trails. We were able to leave our bikes locked up on the deck with no problems. Deck was super relaxing to hang out on and it has a grill that we made good use of. The house was so clean and we had everything we needed for our week stay. Leigh was very responsive and accommodated any needs and answered any questions we had. Would absolutely stay here again!"
14360,1012,"Thank you, Brenda! You all were great guests! Safe travels home and look forward to having y'all again."
14361,1012,"Very pleasant, freshly renovated, clean and functional cottage.
Conveniently located on the edge of town with a country setting, nice open view,
and a lot of privacy. A few minutes away from the trailhead, bike shops, coffee shops (10 min), and Brevard downtown.
Settled in mature trees perfect for a relaxing hammock time after a bike ride.
Leigh is an amazing, instantly responding and very helpful host.

We had a great time! Thank you!"
14362,1012,"Thank you, Peter! You were a pleasure to communicate with and would love to have you back to The Green Haven any time!"
14363,1012,"The Green Haven was the perfect meeting spot for my family to spend a weekend together! The house is adorable, clean, and we LOVED the porch. Not only do you get a great view of the countryside and mountains, you're also so close to incredible Pisgah trails and lovely Brevard. We would totally go back and highly recommended!"
14364,1012,"Thank you, Joanna! You all were a pleasure to have as guests and hope to have you back again soon."
14365,1023,"Perfect location 10 min outside of downtown Asheville. The fenced-in yard has a fire pit with a fully stocked rack of firewood. The living room is comfy with a TV that has access to a Roku. The master bedroom is on the same side as the street, so it may get loud in the morning, starting around 6:45, with dump trucks passing by. There is some construction going on the other side of the river, so I don't think this is the norm. The noise isn't nearly as loud in the back bedroom, and if you use the white noise machine that Jennica provides, you'll be good to go. The bathroom has a cast iron tub and a water heater that can handle filling it up. The space is very clean with thoughtful touches throughout. Jennica was a wonderful host"
14366,1023,Great! Will definitely recommend!
14367,1023,My family had a wonderful stay at Jennica’s house! My 2 kids and dog loved the backyard. The space was comfortable and clean with easy accessibility to Asheville.
14368,1023,"Jennica's home is lovely. We stayed there for a week and found it set up perfectly for all of our needs - thoughtful touches for pet owners, great products in the bathroom, fast wifi (supported simultaneous video calls), and of course the pretty little backyard. It is on a really loud/busy street without a sidewalk so it's a little tough to walk anywhere from the house, but if you brave the shoulder for a short stretch, you can walk around the mill and along the river. Super pretty, and there's a coffee shop back there."
14369,1023,"Jennica’s place was great! It’s welcoming, clean and comfortable! Having a fenced in yard for the pups was one of the main reasons I picked it and we had no issues. Backing out of the driveway could be challenging off the busy road and sort of blind hill/bend. We found that we could swing around through the little lot across the street and wait for traffic to clear, then back up into the driveway. The traffic noise didn’t bother us so much. Someone said a noise machine would be nice and there was one provided in the front bedroom. There were plenty of USB outlets, towels, kitchenware, etc. the only thing I would suggest would be a few kid friendly plates/bowls. Glass dining tables and ceramic dishes always make me a little nervous with a 7 y/o!"
14370,1023,"Jennicas house was great! and the location is ideal to be able to and from downtown easily! the road it's located on is loud as you can hear car drive by while sleeping, but that was the only downside at all!"
14371,1023,I loved how close it was to everything (but still felt private as it was not in the center of downtown.)
14372,1023,"Jennica's place was excellent! homey and quaint, perfect for the dogs to stay. A wonderful stay!"
14373,1023,"Great stay House as described,
Easy access, private, clean"
14374,1023,"We enjoyed our stay at this cute house so much! The piano was a fun touch and the house had so much character. Convenient location. Also, the beds were very comfortable which is always a win!"
14375,1023,"My fiancé, pup and I had a great time at Jennica’s place. It was a cozy weekend getaway close to Asheville. The fire pit was a wonderful feature. Then we played Jenga inside and had a jumbo pizza. Thanks for having us!"
14376,1023,"Such a cute little 1920s home. Very old fashioned and charming space. Reminded me of being at my grandma’s growing up! Only qualm would be the location up against a busy road and the noise of cars whooshing by throughout the night. Wish the house’s location was a bit more tucked away and less dangerous trying to back our car out of. Otherwise, the amenities were cute, the owner was incredibly responsive and helpful, and the place was clean. Thank you for having us!"
14377,1023,My wife and I had a great Thanksgiving with the Family and the dogs. The back yard was great for the dogs to stretch their legs while the food was being prepared. The bed was so comfy and warm. Definitely recommended this place.
14378,1023,"Good space for the value. Fully stocked kitchen for indoor / outdoor cooking. Lots of space, both beds very comfortable. Good location. Only complaint is low water pressure on the shower + sinks. Would recommend, thanks for the stay."
14379,1023,"Beautiful home and perfectly located! Very comfortable, felt like being at home!"
14380,1023,Great place!
14381,1023,This little Airbnb is perfect! The decorations and comfort are great throughout the entire house and that even extends out to the backyard! The house is pet friendly and has a perfect fenced in back yard. There is a local coffee shop within walking distance other than that you have to drive to get to anything. We would definitely rent this house again.
14382,1023,Great place. The backyard was perfect for the dogs and Jennica was a great communicator
14383,1023,"This place was great for all the space you get (including a backyard with fire pit!). It was so nice to have a clean, cozy space that allowed dogs. I definitely recommend this place if you’re looking for a good sleep between exploring the mountains and city of Asheville."
14384,1023,"super clean, comfy, and cozy spot just outside of downtown asheville. pet-friendly with great outdoor space. had a great stay. just be prepared for driveway off main road with no sidewalk. recommend coming and going while it's still light out, or bracing for a slightly nerve-wracking turn. the place itself was totally charming."
14385,1023,House was clean and well stocked and furnished nicely however proximity to busy road and sewage treatment plant made it less attractive.
14386,1023,"Jennica was unbelievably accommodating! This was hands down the most hospitable Airbnb I have stayed in, and I was beyond impressed. Jennica provided the perfect atmosphere. It was an absolute pleasure and I would stay again and again!"
14387,1023,Jennica’s place is amazing! Great location and accommodations. Beds where very comfortable. Street noise can be a little loud but she has a sound machine in the master that drowns it out completely!
14388,1023,"This place has so much charm and is the perfect location in relation to Asheville. We also really loved the town of Woodfin, honestly, so it was easy to love this place. Loved all of the little details throughout the house. Bed was super comfortable and we loved the white noise machine!! Road noise didn’t keep us from good sleep at all. Shower was great and easy to use. We truly appreciated everything this place had to offer!! Didn’t feel like using our personal vehicle to get to/from Asheville was difficult in any way whatsoever."
14389,1023,"This place is awesome and was perfect for us!! Super clean, adorable, and comfortable!!! Jennica is also a superb host, communicative and thoughtful! Would definitely stay here again for my next visit!!!"
14390,1023,Clean and affordable place near Asheville! Loved the outdoor fire pit! Will be back again!
14391,1023,Absolutely beautiful house! Loved the fenced in yard for my dogs and it’s a short drive to everything I wanted to do.
14392,1023,"house was just as advertised, spacious and comfortable. Jennica was excellent with communication, very accommodating of our arrival time and of our dogs who made the trip with us. we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would certainly look to book again on our next trip to the Asheville area."
14393,1023,"We picked this house based on the price point and the location. We were traveling with our 11 month old and dog, the house was perfect for both. The master bedroom has enough room to comfortably fit the pack and play. The backyard fire pit was nice in the evening, there is also a picnic table that was perfect for meals. Some reviews said the driveway was steep, it is not bad for the mountains but narrow so best to back into the spot, we had no issues. We spent most our time around Asheville, the house being so close to everything made it easy to get back at nap time and no issues getting an Uber. The host was very helpful and responded quickly. I’ve stayed at several airbnbs in Asheville and would certainly stay here again!"
14394,1023,"The house is on a busy and pretty loud road (which is made clear in the listing and there is a white noise machine in the main bedroom which definitely helped drown out the noise to sleep), the road noise can be heard in the backyard. There is a sewage plant nearby and a handful of times, we could definitely smell it when we were in the yard. The house is well stocked, had a nice vintage feel to it, and the bed was comfy. The fenced backyard was nice for our dog. Location to town was great and the coffee shop nearby was an easy walk and had delicious coffee. I would recommend backing into the driveway as backing out can sketchy as oncoming traffic is a bit hard to see."
14395,1023,"Wonderful home. Very clean with tons of extras!! Backyard chairs and fire pit, with wood provided. Lovely kitchen, spacious, comfortable beds and bedrooms. Stayed for just one night, and arrived late so we didn’t get to explore the neighborhood. It’s only a few minutes from downtown. Recommend staying here."
14396,1023,"We loved Jennica's place! We stayed there with our friends and their dogs, and it was the perfect spot for a quick getaway. We would love to stay again!"
14397,1023,"Really comfortable, clean spot. Good location to explore Asheville."
14398,1023,Jennica’s place is in an awesome location! She was very responsive and accommodating. Would definitely stay here again the next time we are in Asheville.
14399,1023,Very clean and comfortable! Easy drive to Asheville.
14400,1023,"Great little place just outside main Asheville! Backyard was easily accessible for dogs, and there are separate areas for humans (fire pit) and dogs (grass). Yard was totally fenced in for a dog of any size. Only thing I’d make someone aware of is that the road noise could startle a young child or dog."
14401,1023,"Excellent place to stay, really close to town and right on the river. The rental has everything you can think of that you would need while away from home. Hands down the best Airbnb I've stayed at that's pet friendly and I've stayed at plenty."
14402,1023,I had a great stay at Jennica’s. The house was very clean and exactly as described. My dogs loved the fenced in backyard.
14403,1023,A nice stay. Jennica was very responsive.
14404,1023,Great spot by the river. Coffee shop across the street is in the water and a great place to hangout and unwind. This is a great house and worked well for us allowing us to bring our dogs with us on vacation. Highly recommend.
14405,1023,"We enjoyed our time at Jennica's! The house was beautifully decorated, clean and had everything we needed for our 2 night stay. The location was perfect for visiting Asheville and Biltmore. The fenced backyard was an added bonus too!"
14406,1023,great place and as described
14407,1023,The house is perfect for a get a way to the Asheville area. It’s close enough to the city without having to deal with the crowds.
14408,1023,Great place to stay in Asheville! Loved the location.
14409,1023,"Jennica’s place was a great little spot for passing through town. Close to downtown, easy check in, clean, charming and comfortable."
14410,1023,"If you are looking for a cute and cozy place that is exactly what you are getting! We did not have one issue that needed to be addressed the entire time there because everything was in great working order and clean. We loved the fenced in oasis with a great fire pit and seating area, Jennica even provided the wood! The chalkboard wall in the kitchen was our daughters favorite feature. She’s 2 and loves to “color”. Jennica provides everything you could need from dishes, detergent, body products, towels, and plenty of pillows and linens. We would definitely stay here again!

I will say this place is on a very active street that noisy from about 4-5am til around 11-12 at night. She did mention it’s a city house in the listing so I just to add this in passing for light sleepers. We didn’t have an issue with this because we always travel with a fan and that helped drown out the traffic."
14411,1023,Lovely place! Close to downtown
14412,1023,Jennica’s place is just as advertised - clean and charming. Easy quick drive to downtown Asheville. Great fenced-in yard for your pups. Would highly recommend!
14413,1023,"The bungalow was super cozy and comfortable, and equipped with everything we needed. Kitchen was well equipped for cooking our meals, stocked with coffee, and there were a few snacks left for us that we brought on our hike. Beds were comfy. Being able to do a load of laundry in the house was a nice convenience. The street noise was noticeable at first, but didn’t bother us when we went to sleep…I did use the included white noise machine in our room, which was nice. Having a fully fenced in backyard and outdoor seating was perfect for us and our dog. Location is a very short walk across the street to the river and High Five Coffee, where we met some really nice folks. A short drive to downtown. Highly recommend!"
14414,1023,Great place- very close to everything and super cozy place to relax after a busy day/night out on the town.
14415,1023,"Jennica's home was great! The home is a great space, clean and plenty of room to relax, and it's a perfect location to explore Asheville and the surrounding area. Jennica was a great host, answered all of our questions, had great attention detail throughout the house (USB adapters, well stocked kitchen, bathroom and laundry, white noise machine, fire pit prepped with wood, and the welcome guide had a lot of great tips) A really great home and host!"
14416,1023,Jennica’s place is lovely! The beds were comfortable and clean. Very close to downtown and other activities on the same road as the house.
14417,1023,"Cozy place, easy check-in, and convenient to downtown Asheville!"
14418,1023,Great visit accurate listing
14419,1023,"Jennica’s house is exactly as described, it is a cute little house with everything you need to have a lovely stay. She provides linens, coffee and even soap and shampoo. There is even firewood in case you want to use the fire ring in the back yard. I would definitely stay here again."
14420,1023,"great little place, there is a lot of small brewerys on the main road which made it really nice."
14421,1023,"Would recommend ! Perfect house, and location!"
14422,1023,Great place to stay. Convenient and easy ride to downtown. Nice fire pit in the backyard. Don’t miss coffee on the river right across the street
14423,1023,Awesome place to stay!
14424,1023,Easy access to Asheville and a wonderful backyard space for those traveling with pets!
14425,1023,"We met up with friends for a weekend in Asheville & stayed at Jennica's place. The decorations and details are nice in the house, I wish one of us knew how to play piano! Two good sized bedrooms with comfy beds and the bathroom is fully stocked as is the kitchen. House has a washer/dryer if you need that which is nice. Outside area is super nice, especially if you build a fire. The only 2 things I would mention as caution are just due to the location itself & folks have already mentioned it. 1) The noise from the road as it is on a main road. We were in the back bedroom and weren't bothered at all but a light sleeper in the other bedroom might be bothered. 2) The smell outside from the sewer plant is significant (smells like rotten eggs.) We weren't bothered by either of those & I completely recognize that Jennica can't do anything to control either of those but I think they are worth mentioning. We had a great stay, downtown AVL is super close & we easily got an Uber to and from the house in the evening."
14426,1023,"We loved our stay at Jennica’s sweet house. We stayed with our two dogs who loved the backyard. The house is well stocked and close to everything you’ll need. There were even dog bags for us! We spent our trip hiking in the mountains and walking around Asheville. Both were easy drives from the bnb. The center of Asheville is truly only 10 minutes away. There are also a few cute parks closer to the house, which we enjoyed. Highly recommend staying here!!"
14427,1023,"Jennica's bungalow is such a quaint and cozy location, less than 10 minutes from downtown Asheville. The rooms are beautifully decorated and clean. The king bed is spacious and comfy. The kitchen is well stocked for cooking needs and there are complimentary snacks available. The fenced in back yard is an added bonus for your fur babies. We thoroughly enjoyed our kid free vacation here!"
14428,1023,"Great stay! Jennica gave us lovely recommendations, and the place is super nice and has many thoughtful touches. Highly recommend!"
14429,1023,Great stay not far from downtown. We were traveling with babies and back yard fire pit was great to relax around after everyone was in bed.
14430,1023,"This place was perfect for a long weekend in Asheville! It's only an 8 minute drive to downtown and to the brewery and river arts districts, and a quick drive to the Biltmore estate. The house was very clean and had everything we needed."
14431,1023,"This was a cute and cozy house! It’s situated across from a sewage processing plant of some sort, so the smell outside was pretty bad for a couple of days, but not the whole time, and there was no smell inside the house, thankfully. For there being a $75 cleaning fee, the extensive expectations around guests cleaning for the checkout process were a little high in our opinion. Overall, however, we were pleased with the cleanliness of the house, very comfortable beds, fire pit and fenced-in backyard, and that it was pet friendly."
14432,1023,This home is full of character and extremely clean with very nice touches. It was extremely spacious and had everything we needed. The only comment would be the smell outside as it’s outside a sewage plant.
14433,1023,Good place if you are coming with your fur baby:)
14434,1023,"Dog friendly house, nestled in the hills outside of Asheville. Convenient location, clean, and has a fenced in backyard! Jennica was quick to respond to any questions/concerns."
14435,1053,"Here are things the host considers normal:
- wide open septic field and earth movers, instead of back yard pictured
- bare plywood and windows covered by noisily flapping roofing felt, rather than exterior pictured
- unlit darkness upon arrival, leading to difficulty with entering home
- cockroaches
- providing no filters for the coffee maker, with no heads up about what type to bring
- multiple automated emails about observing quiet hours, rather than a welcome
- chiding the guest that this lack of hospitality is to be accepted, because the host ""is a super host""

The host did refund the nightly rate, as we left after only one night, but that means we are still out nearly half of what we paid. It is clear from other reviews that those who stay when the property is not a construction site, arrive during daylight, require insistent reminders to not be rowdy, don't mind roaches, don't appreciate the back yard, and don't enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning, all have a wonderful time."
14436,1053,"Sorry we did not meet your expectations
This is our fault.

We certainly do not consider the renovations as normal, again we apologize about that. It will all be finished ASAP. We had some set backs and in the future we will allow much more time than necessary for repairs. We failed with our exterior property condition for this specific reservation only. This will absolutely not happen again. However the inside of our 100 year old home is beautifully finished and is always kept very clean. It will be absolutely immaculate once we finish renovations on the exterior.

Bethany saw one bug… also we have and have had a contract with a pest control company.

We have a bright light on the porch where the lock box is. It was left on for her.

We have found that a couple of automated reminders work very efficiently at communicating information needed by our guest in the most timely manner.

We also respond very quickly in person to all messages and/or calls as shown by our impeccable response rate with 140+ guest.

Again we apologize whole heartedly to Bethany and her husband who were affected by our mistake in this instance.

We will use this isolated incident as a learning experience and make sure this never happens again."
14437,1053,"The exterior of the house and grounds surrounding the house were under renovations, it will be beautiful when completed. The weather was horrendous, dropping 40 degrees in a few hours with gale force winds for 2 days, but once the house warmed up it stayed that way. The gas stove was wonderful and the Kitchen had every thing we needed to cook a Christmas Eve dinner for 8. The location was prefect, close to the beach, woodland trails, and great restaurants, deli's and bakery."
14438,1053,"A cozy, clean house in an excellent location. With shops, beaches and sightseeing options nearby. Everything was prepared for our arrival. Appreciate we were able to bring a pet. Travis and Danielle were very responsive."
14439,1053,Great location and host was very responsive and nice!
14440,1053,Everyone has been very nice.
14441,1053,Nice place to stay
14442,1053,Great place to stay. Very clean and check in/out was a breeze. Owners are very responsive.
14443,1053,"Travis & Danielle accommodated a last minute stay for us when our camper broke down on the road. Very responsive, helpful & kind. Spacious for our family & we will gladly stay again."
14444,1053,Second time staying here and with family taking over it had more than enough space and all A/C units worked excellent. Great amenities and very clean. Couldn’t ask for better response times and flexibility with guests. Highly recommend!
14445,1053,Very good
14446,1053,"Stayed at the Buxton Ranch for a wedding in September. Very convenient spot for a Hatteras stay, plenty of room for a family gathering. A couple of updates are needed but the owners plan on that this winter. Very nice, quick responding owners."
14447,1053,Such a quiet & relaxing place to stay!
14448,1053,The owner was very nice. They gave us suggestions on where we should go. The Airbnb was very clean.
14449,1053,Affordable place to stay.
14450,1053,Hosts are very responsive. Place was clean and welcoming
14451,1053,"Great home for a family vacation, convenient and very affordable. The location is perfect for sightseeing, beaches and many places to have fun. Wished we could stay longer but may be next time. My whole family liked the house and already making plans to come back next year. Thanks"
14452,1053,Beautiful home and great location.
14453,1053,"House was spacious and accommodating. The owners were quick to respond and take care of issues we encountered.
Be aware that there is no central air, only window units in this big house and house will be warm in summer."
14454,1053,"Hi, we will be updating much of this property this winter including the HVAC. Thanks for staying with us!!"
14455,1053,"The Buxton Ranch is a great place to stay: vary spacious for our party of 6 (4 adults & 2 childreen), kitchen is fully stocked with all the necessities to cook a familly meal. Location is great to get to the many National Seashore beaches. Also really appreciated that our furbaby was welcomed. Thanks for a wonderfull vacation rental."
14456,1053,"Awesome stay, clean and a great value!"
14457,1053,"If you're looking for a place to stay that's clean, convenient, and close to the action this is the one. We really enjoyed our stay at the Buxton ranch. This place worked great for the size of our group."
14458,1053,Had a great experience with my stay here. Great value for your money here. Would definitely recommend this place to friends and family.
14459,1053,"Very responsive hosts. We had a hiccup, but they fixed it immediately. Love Buxton! Less touristy, wonderful local vibe. Buxton Ranch has a great location - minutes from beach access and restaurants."
14460,1053,"The house is nestled right off of Hwy 12 in Buxton, NC. Central to a lot of water and fun activities. We enjoyed the common areas to gather and hang out as a family. We had six of us and we all slept comfortably. I love I could bring my dog too. She loved the vacation. The value of this hidden gem is awesome. I definitely recommend. The only thing I would caution is there is not central air. The upstairs gets very hot in the hall and bathroom . The kitchen and eat in dining area also get hot, especially when cooking. Each room does have an individual a/c unit other than that and it stays comfortable in the rest of the house. The main road isn’t noisy at all in the house. The side deck and backyard are very peaceful. I liked sitting on the front porch watching cars while sipping my coffee."
14461,1053,The location of this house is perfect! The world famous Apple Uglies at the Orange Blossom Cafe are just down the road and the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse with beach access to Cape Hatteras National Seashore is just two miles away. Conner's Grocery is even closer and will have everything you need. We will definitely be staying at Buxton Ranch again on future trips!
14462,1053,"Absolutely wonderful!!! The house is in the perfect location, close to everything, and had everything we needed to have a comfortable stay. The kitchen had all the pots, pans, and utensils I needed to cook for our family of 7, and everything in the home was very clean. It truly felt like a home away from home, I highly recommend staying here!"
14463,1053,"Very nice, clean well maintained home. Excellent location close to the Ocracoke ferry. Hassle free experience"
14464,1053,Wonderful home that has everything you need. We should have booked for longer because it was such a nice stay and trip! I love that they allowed my fur babies!
14465,1053,"Perfect beach stay! Clean and convenient with easy access to restaurants and beach. So thankful for being pet friendly, as that is hard to find. Will book again in the future!"
14466,1053,"Our stay was good , the house was close to everything . House was clean, could use minor updating. Overall decent stay for the price. Watch for sand spurs/mini cacti plants in front yard, and giant water bugs on back porch at night they try to get inside through the kitchen."
14467,1053,This little house was in the perfect location for all of the fishing out of Hatteras Village that we did. It was clean and comfortable. The AC works great. The kitchen is well stocked. We would definitely consider staying here again for our next fishing trip.
14468,1053,Staying at the Buxton Ranch with my family made my first trip to the Outerbanks one I will cherish for the rest of my life. Being able to bring our fur babies free of extra charge was such a relief - they even provided a tie out on the deck. We also rented the apartment over the garage so there would be enough room for all of us. I would highly recommend to any family member or friend.
14469,1053,"Very clean, quaint house located within minutes of beautiful beaches."
14470,1053,"Very nice place, close to great restaurant and convenient located. Great hosts and fast communication"
14471,1053,We had a fantastic vacation at this lovely old farm house. The owners were very responsive when messaged. We would definitely stay here again!
14472,1053,"I stayed in the house for a few days with my parents (60+) and in-laws. The house is cozy, comfortable and very charming in a strategic location to beaches in the south of Outerbanks and not too far from the north. The house had some minor flaws but Travis and Danielle are very responsive and caring so they will definitely help you if you come across any issues in the house. Recommended!"
14473,1053,"Location is fantastic. A few minutes drive to Cape Hatteras Light House and Natl Park, including museum and beach accesses there. Orange Blossom Cafe is a must for amazing pastries and breakfast sandwiches. Conners Grocery store is also just a few minutes drive. Buxton Village Books is a lovely store. (It’s a must-see). It’s about 15 minutes drive to the end of Hatteras down by Frisco to catch the ferries to Ocracoke."
14474,1053,"Charming home with lots of character and thoughtful details. Hosts were responsive and communication was great, even on short notice!"
14475,1053,"Great value compared to other prices in the area. Old house but nice on the inside. Owners were easy to communicate with. If you are coming to fish, note the property does not have a fish cleaning table/area. Also the blinds let in a lot of light early morning, so bring some eye shades."
14476,1053,Great old school style Hatteras house! Super great location!
14477,1053,Travis and Danielle were prompt and courteous. Great to work with.
14478,1053,Great communication. Would recommend. Great for family trips.
14479,1053,"Great place, very warm and kind welcome, easy communication and beautiful surroundings"
14480,1053,Great place and plenty of room for a group and/or family.
14481,1053,We stayed for a quick weekend with our three kids and two pups and it was a comfortable stay for everyone! Very clean and spacious place that had everything needed for a comfortable stay.
14482,1053,"Hi Danielle, we so enjoyed our stay in Buxton at your place. It was so ""Buxtonishous"" - simple, ordinary, yet cheery!! It perfectly complemented our tour of Ocracoke, Hatteras, Rodanthe, and Kitty Hawk."
14483,1053,"Will totally rent again one day! Great value; easy drive to beach, stores, bait shop, lighthouse… we rented in March on a warm weekend. AC units worked fine in house when needed. House was clean and decorated well. Beds were comfortable. Don’t forget charcoal if you want to grill. Will need to buy wood for backyard fire pit.
Careful in bare feet, a few small cacti type plants in front lawn. Did not bother dog, but 2 of us stepped on them and it caught our attention. Did not have any barbs in feet though, so pretty minor.
Owners were super fast with communication and very kind. Reason I am giving 4 stars is due to the fridge not staying cold/freezer not freezing. It was just slightly cool when we unloaded our coolers, but hours later we felt something was wrong. Next am confirmed it was not working. Reached out to owners but guessing due to weekend, it was not able to repaired. Overall, it was worth it and we are thankful as we were last minute renting it only a week in advance. Cheers!"
14484,1053,"Travis and Danielle were really helpful
and supportive. They went out of their
way to make sure everything was in
order and that my requests were met.
The house was really clean and well kept
with amazing setups. I really enjoyed my
time there and everything was very
smooth and peaceful."
14485,1053,Fantastic location! Will stay again when I return.
14486,1053,"Perfect getaway-even in the off season. Everything you could ever need or want is just a short drive away. Clean, cozy home filled with character. Nice yard for your dog-the trees provided privacy. Loved listening to the birds singing while sitting on the deck sipping coffee. Beds were very comfortable, and had lots of pillows and blankets for extra comfort."
14487,1053,"Travis & Danielle’s home is very clean , comfortable and well appointed . The location is perfect for our needs .
Communication was very timely . We can’t wait to stay there again for upcoming future stays !"
14488,1053,Very cute and clean farmhouse stay. Hard to feel cozy in a strangers house but this place was very cozy!
14489,1053,"The house had great location, atmosphere and was very clean. We had an amazing time!"
14490,1053,"Great stay, you will see us again. Very clean and well stocked. 5 Stars from the Pastore’s"
14491,1053,Thank you!
14492,1053,It was a fun place to stay in a nice area. There is plenty of room and had everything we needed to stay for the weekend!
14493,1053,"You will find a very comfortable home with that ""good ole"" home feeling. It is awesome.
thank you"
14494,1053,"Great spot! Perfect location, home was clean and just what we needed for a surf trip. Thank you!"
14495,1053,We had a wonderful time at this house. Clean & beautiful environment and hosts were welcoming & communicative. The house has everything we needed for our stay.
14496,1053,"Darling home, wonderfully responsive and kind hosts. Everything was clean and tidy. We are so grateful. I highly recommend this home and hosts! ♥️"
14497,1053,House was ready to go when we arrived! Clean and very homey feel!
14498,1053,As advertised neat clean. Just what we wanted. Going back next fall and this is we are staying.
14499,1053,"Absolutely great stay! Spacious, very clean and easy checking in/out. Located very close to Frisco and Buxton beaches. Will definitely try to stay here again and recommend to friends/family!"
14500,1053,Very good place and location
14501,1053,"Nice place, nice people but poor management... be careful when walking over the carpets... and the washrooms have no privacy, get prepared for that also..."
14502,1053,"Sorry if there was some sand spurs in the carpet, we will remedy that ASAP. As far as privacy… there is nothing but bushes out the window of the wash room…that being said we will also remedy that. We were disappointed that none of trash (5 full bags) was taken out to the trash can, but instead left in the kitchen… also the bathroom mirror was taken off the wall."
14503,1053,Great location in Buxton. Plenty of space and clean. Parking was easy. I would stay here again.
14504,1053,"Exactly what it claims to be. Fantastic location, pet friendly, clean, and we would stay here again."
14505,1053,Travis and Danielle's place had everything you needed in the kitchen. Great location. Comfortable space. Great hosts.
14506,1053,Great location.
14507,1053,What a hidden gem. We loved the nostalgic feel with the hidden touches modern. Great location and excellent host.
14508,1111,"Great place, very clean nice and in a great location. Coby was great to deal with. Will be back for sure."
14509,1111,"Perfect location for a quick girls trip. Clean, and safe with the internal gated entry. Great communication too!"
14510,1111,"Exactly where you want to be in downtown Wilmington. Historic building, great courtyard, right in the middle of all the best restaurants. Space is just the right size and has everything you need. Desk for remote work was appreciated. Great shower, comfortable bed. Smelled amazing in the unit."
14511,1111,Best location for any activity in downtown Wilmington!
14512,1111,"convenient location. check in information was clear. listed as a four guest capacity but that would be really tight if all four had a full size suitcase. The shower privacy would also be of concern. The door between the living area and bath is glass and the shower door is glass, so it's a clear view straight through. Not a problem at all for one couple but potentially a bit awkward. kitchenette is adequate. full size fridge/ freezer. overall a pleasant stay in a great location with tons of food and beverage options just steps away."
14513,1111,Really awesome place to stay. Walkable to everything and a grocery store right across the street. Definitely recommend to anyone wanting to explore the downtown of Wilmington!
14514,1111,The location of Colby’s place is perfect for walking to the night life downtown! It was clean and the locked courtyard that the apartment was inside of made it feel extra secure.
14515,1111,"Great place to stay! Loved the area and the unique location of this unit made it so fun! Everything was very clean and the host communicated check in, parking, and other instructions very clearly. Super kind host!"
14516,1111,"We’ve stayed at 4 other AirBnBs in downtown Wilmington and out of all of them, we’ll be coming back here. The location is central to everything, but removed from the main drag just enough that nightlife noise is not a bother. Inside is just enough space to provide the essentials and comfort. 10/10 recommend"
14517,1111,"Great location, room was very clean and easy to get access to. The host was easy to get in contact with and would highly recommend."
14518,1111,Perfect location and would recommend!
14519,1111,Loved the place!
14520,1111,Had a good stay. Super neat & a cute space.
14521,1111,Great location and perfect space for my wife and I!
14522,1111,Great spot for solo biz.
14523,1111,Such a great place right in downtown- thank you so much!
14524,1111,"Place was beautiful, Clean and quiet, Keep in mind it's downtown so you will have to pay to park being Coby only provide one pass."
14525,1111,"Great spot in downtown Wilm. It was spacious and clean. Easy entry and convenient parking.
Only negative is thin walls/other tenants coming in late from downtown activities. Otherwise great stay."
14526,1111,Great place in a prime location
14527,1111,"Awesome spot! Walkable to many things, comfy, modern, and absolutely perfect for a short weekend stay."
14528,1111,"Great stay, fabulous location. Would recommend!"
14529,1111,My son surprised me with a gift and Coby was very helpful in making that happen.
14530,1111,GREAT PLACE. VERY CLEAN. EASY TO FIND
14531,1111,"I booked this place for the minister for my wedding. It was close to our venue, and as a result incredibly walkable around downtown Wilmington. Coby was incredible responsive and helpful answering my multiple questions. He was very flexible on adding the ministers dog, adding her name to the reservation, etc… the only hiccup was that there was no hot water both nights, but I didn’t know until later. I would still book this place again because of how helpful Coby was, and how well maintained the property was."
14532,1111,"Very quiet, nice place"
14533,1111,Great place. Great location. Exactly what we needed for the weekend.
14534,1111,Great stay
14535,1111,"Great location to downtown! Apartment was clean and tidy! A bit smaller than I expected, but great for what we needed. Access to the apartment is easy and no keys are required. We enjoyed our stay in Wilmington!"
14536,1111,"The location was great, and the place was beautiful. The cleanliness was good, but not immaculate (a dirty dish in the cabinet, pet hair). Coby was very polite, but communication was a consistent challenge. We did not receive answers to hardly any of our inquiries in a helpful timeframe. For example, we reached out about Coby giving us an expired parking pass, and because of the delay in hearing back, paid for parking for part of our stay, even though it was supposed to be included. We also got a parking ticket due to the expired parking pass we were given, but Coby kindly said he will get it dismissed. Overall, we felt frustrated due to questions and concerns not being answered in a helpful timeframe, but grateful for the beautiful place and location Coby allowed us to stay at."
14537,1111,"Hi Gina,

Thank you for bringing the cleanliness to my attention. I will ensure this is addressed with the cleaners. As for the communication, I was in the mountains so my service was quite spotty. I appreciate your input and I hope you come back to visit soon."
14538,1111,The location is GREAT. It’s right in the heart of downtown Wilmington and walking distance to everything. Place was clean and comfortable. I had only 2 inconveniences. The shower took forever to warm up and was confusing to work. As well as communication with the airbnb host. In the description it says there will be a pet fee. We listed our guests and animals. It was not tacked on to the checkout process which I believe should be to see the total amount at the end. I felt like it was a major inconvenience when he asked later on after we stayed to pay the pet fee. It should be all included in the beginning with the cleaning fee and service fee.
14539,1111,I absolutely loved my short stay!
14540,1111,"My wife , our dog and I had a really nice stay here. Unit is clean, as pictured, and super convenient parking and walk distance to the water front. Only suggestion is that prospective guests should be aware that it the beds headboard is on the wall that backs up to event venue next door - having a white noise app will help you neutralize the bass that may be pumping from the venue when there is an evening event."
14541,1111,"Great location, great property, great host!"
14542,1111,Had a wonderful time staying here. The property was very clean and so close to everything.
14543,1111,Great place to stay! Coby was very helpful throughout my stay and very responsive. Had an issue with a previous tenant not leaving behind the parking pass and Coby was quick to refund my parking costs! If I stay in Wilmington again and this unit is available I will definitely be back!
14544,1111,Amazing place
14545,1111,"Location is EVERYTHING!!! We did arrive in the heat of the evening on a Saturday night, so traffic was a bit difficult to navigate. However, when you're staying in the heart of downtown, amongst everything you could possibly need, I feel that's to be expected. The only driving needed is to the beach!!! Niche shops, various options and scales of dining, as well as bars, museums, markets, etc! You name it, and it's just around the corner. And you can't hear the city buzz at all from the condo! There is a venue hall next door, so if that is rented out then you may hear some noise from that, but it didn't keep us up at night. Coby provided excellent instructions upon arrival, and even offered us an early check in because the condo had been prepared earlier than expected! would absolutely recommend this quaint, modern condo a thousand times over!"
14546,1111,Great place to stay!
14547,1111,"Clean, comfortable. Easy to get in and out of with convenient parking. Good location, quiet at night. The hot water in the shower was tricky, but overall we had a very nice stay."
14548,1111,Nice little spot within walking distance to downtown Wilmington.
14549,1111,"Very nice unit. Very small but does not feel it, in a great location"
14550,1111,"Very clean, can walk easily from the location to eat and see downtown! Only ~15 min from Wrightsville beach! Loved this place."
14551,1111,Not a bad place bed isn’t very comfortable close to down town I had to wait in my car for an hour to see if anyone would bring me a parking pass then I just paid for it and same thing happened next morning need better communication but over all a clean place to stay and I would stay there again
14552,1111,"Hi Demetrius,

Thank you for bringing the bed issue to my attention. I will make sure this issue is remedied. Per our conversations I described to you that the cleaner had inadvertently thrown away the parking pass. I explained that the office was currently closed and would not open until 8 am the following morning. The pass was the retrieved and dropped off before 815 the following morning. I’m not sure where the disconnect was but I tried to keep you updated throughout the entire process. We appreciate your input and hope you come back to see us soon.

Best regards,

Coby"
14553,1111,"Incredibile location, very clean and extremely worth it overall! Just a walk away from many things to do in Wilmington’s Historic district and a close drive to the beach. Definitely a great stay when visiting Wilmington and an awesome host!"
14554,1111,"Great location, super close to the Riverwalk.
Love the shower. Overall a great stay."
14555,1111,AMAZING! Will definitely book here again! If you need a nice lowkey place to stay this is it!
14556,1111,"Unit was very clean and looks exactly like the pictures! Parking was convenient. Several shops, a convenience store, and restaurants are a quick walk away. Overall it’s quite small and the shower is glass and can be seen from the bedroom and even the main room, so more appropriate for couples or a solo trip."
14557,1111,"Lovely place, clean, cozy, great location."
14558,1111,Cozy apartment and great location! Close to everything downtown has to offer. Would definitely stay there again!
14559,1111,Great place as advertised. Fantastic location.
14560,1111,"Cute, Clean apartment in the heart of Wilmington. Perfect location to restaurants and other fun. Highly recommend!"
14561,1111,Great stay and perfect location!
14562,1111,"The place is nicely decorated and spacious enough for 2 people. Great location!!! It was very clean for the most part but I did notice some dog hair. Not sure if the previous guest had dogs and it was just hard to get all the dog hair, which I could understand. Overall, great place!!"
14563,1111,"Place was clean & comfortable, nicely decorated. Great location near restaurants. Nice to have the parking opposite too.
Slightly expensive for what it is in my opinion. It’s like a studio/hotel room. Plus the cleaning fee at $125 + pet fee at $120 is very steep compared to other options in the area."
14564,1111,"Nice clean place with great downtown location. Walls are pretty thin so you can hear absolutely everything at all hours, but then again, makes sense for a downtown apartment."
14565,1111,Very convenient to downtown Wilmington. Very clean and comfortable unit for 1 to 2 people. We would definitely stay there again!
14566,1111,Great place for a weekend stay perfect size for two.
14567,1111,"Great place, very close to downtown and restaurants. Coby was very responsive and a great host."
14568,1111,"Coby’s place is in the perfect area! Many restaurants and shops within a few blocks. We loved Manna, Taco Baby, Pinpoint, The Blind Elephant, Bespoke, and Bagels on Pointe! Coby’s spot was awesome to have as our home base during our trip. Awesome decor and even included a record player (so cute!) and a waterfall shower😌 Parking was super easy in the lot right across the street!"
14569,1111,"What a great little place! Convenient, clean and charming. We highly recommend this rental."
14570,1111,"Super cool condo in the best possible location in downtown Wilmington. Discreetly located inside an industrial looking ""feed store"" building, passers by would never guess these condos existed. Once you enter the second door, (keypad secured) you arrive in a courtyard with greenery and seating for coffee/wine. It's an unexpected and serene place for being so close to all the action of downtown Wilmington.

The condo door is off of the courtyard, also keypad secured.

The condo itself is very well laid out and super cool. The living/kitchen space is pretty cozy, but has everything you need. A comfy sofa, big TV with apple TV, full fridge, nice sink with disposal and small dishwasher, ect.
I wouldn't plan on cooking any 4 course meals in the kitchen, but it had everything me and my partner could ask for during our stay.
The record player is a cool touch.

The bed is super comfy, with nice linens, pillows, blankets. Made we want to make some changes to mine at home!

The shower is pretty impressive. Glass door, 4 shower heads, large tile ""bench"" area. My shower seems so boring now lol. Especially since the glass shower is directly off the bedroom, so whoever you are staying with probably see you naked 😏. I assume if your staying in the same bed with someone that's probably OK. I personally enjoyed the adventurous, European vibe to the setup.

The location is unbeatable. Fork n cork is 100 feet away. Ibiza nightclub, Kilwin's ice cream, and just about every other cool spot in Wilmington is in walking distance. My personal favorite was Rebellion NC. The Says Juan chicken sandwich blew my mind.

The parking lot across the street never filled up during my stay, so the parking pass supplied was perfect.

Nothing negative to say really. Had a great time. Coby responded immediately to messages, and sent all the necessary info before check in. If your looking for a unique, afordable place to stay in downtown Wilmington, look no further."
14571,1111,Overall a pleasant experience.
14572,1111,Coby's place was perfect for a Wilmington getaway. The apartment met all our needs and the location is in a prime spot close to all things downtown. It is also a quick ride to the beaches. The modern touches to the apartment make it a comfortable and nice place to stay.
14573,1111,Great location. Blocks from the waterfront. Lots to do in walking distance. Super easy check in and out. Coby was great with any and all communications. Would definitely stay there again without a doubt.
14574,1111,"Clean, great location, & very accommodating!"
14575,1111,Coby’s place is gorgeous with perfect little touches. Awesome location — everything downtown is within walking distance. Would definitely come back!
14576,1111,I would definitely stay here again.
14577,1111,Fabulous place! I can see why this has Super Host status with Airbnb!
14578,1111,"Excellent place, amazing location!"
14579,1111,Perfect spot for a weekend getaway! Walking by distance to everything you need. Coby’s place was clean and his great communication helped make the weekend a breeze.
14580,1138,Such a fun place.
14581,1138,Very clean and cozy! Safe quiet area. Very responsive hosts.
14582,1138,"Hi Juliana, thank you for your review. Come back soon with the new baby! Much luck to you!"
14583,1138,Super cute cabins in a great location. Felt rustic and private. We really enjoyed our stay :)
14584,1138,"Small, cozy cabin worked for 2 adults & our dog! Nice fenced in yard, heating was great for the snow day. Close ride to downtown, outlets, etc."
14585,1138,Thank you Maria so much for last minute accommodations. This spot couldn't have been cozier. A home away from home.
14586,1138,"Great place, will go back!"
14587,1138,"This little cabin was perfect for me, my husband and our dog to have a quick weekend getaway! It was small and cozy on the inside but clean! We also loved how easy it was to drive into DT Asheville."
14588,1138,"What a wonderful location for day/night tripping, downtown, down the street or hikes. And having a fence for my little dog to crunch all the leaves and explore made the cost totally worth it. Totally welcoming staff and office. Plenty of hot water. Let's all fill up ice trays when we leave, yeah - do it! The walk in camp to fire and dog area beyond your own place very friendly."
14589,1138,"Great little cabin near Asheville. Cozy, clean and pet friendly. Would definitely stay again!"
14590,1138,"Great location, cute cabins! We really enjoyed our stay, will definitely use again next time we visit Asheville."
14591,1138,"We loved visiting Asheville. This cabin is at a great location! We only stayed one night, but we had everything we needed!"
14592,1138,The cabin was nice considering the age of the structure. If you are looking for a real log cabin this is the place.
14593,1138,"We always enjoy staying at John’s and Maria’s cabins. Great area for the pups, good AC, and nice location."
14594,1138,"Great place, close to Ashville!"
14595,1138,Great little quick easy getaway nice and comfortable!
14596,1138,"Our cabin was cozy and charming, check in and out was super simple, and I feel like you'd be hard pressed to find a better deal in the area."
14597,1138,"We have stayed multiple times at the Log Cabin Motor Lodge. The fenced yard is perfect for traveling with our dogs. We love the cabins and the location. Considering the promontory to the interstate, it’s actually pretty quiet. The only thing needed is a more comfortable bed and it would be perfect. I still highly recommend a stay here!"
14598,1138,"Cool, historic motor court. Worth a stop."
14599,1138,This cabin is small but very cozy and comfortable. It was great to have the fenced in area for our dog. It was close to everything we needed. We'll be back!
14600,1138,Amazing stay
14601,1138,"It’s well worth the money. It’s such a cute place and made me, my husband & son feel right at home."
14602,1138,Cute dog friendly cabin close to Asheville 10/10!
14603,1138,These cabins are SO cute & the location is really nice & private. I wanted to stay extra nights!
14604,1138,This place is amazing! 5/5! The employees on site were so friendly and helpful. Place was clean and cozy. Will definitely return!
14605,1138,Sweet little rustic romantic cabins. Fair value.
14606,1138,"Just as advertised. The fenced in front yard was great for our dogs. The location is close to a lot of hiking trails, breweries, and restaurants. Easy check-in and check-out procedures. We would go back again!"
14607,1138,"Thanks for the info, I will let the maintenance man know about these issues"
14608,1138,"Wonderful hospitality and a great spot, especially if you are travelling with dogs! I really enjoyed the cozy gas fireplace, as well as having kitchen space and the fenced yard and porch to enjoy."
14609,1138,"Nice tiny cabin for a quick stay in Asheville. Nice enclosed front yard for dogs to be let out. Not the nicest part of the street or part of Asheville, but a great bargain. Communication was not the best during my stay."
14610,1138,Felt warm and at home in this lovely cabin.
14611,1138,"The stay was fine for a quick overnight on a long road trip. Clean enough, check in was easy, and I liked the little fenced in area where I could let my pup off leash. My specific unit was closer to the road where there is what sounded like a local bar or outdoor area that was extremely loud with people yelling/screaming for hours late into the night. I'm all for having a good time, but this wasn't ideal given I had a 10 hour drive ahead of me the next morning and just wanted to get a good night's sleep. Just something to keep in mind if staying on a Friday night like I did."
14612,1138,"We're sorry you did not have a quiet night. The restaurant on site has been closed since December, and there is not a bar close to us, so I don't know where the noise was coming from. The is another rental property next to our cabins, maybe that's where it came from. In any case, sorry for any inconvenience and hope you'll visit again."
14613,1138,The cabin is great for a cozy weekend getaway. It’s close to both downtown Asheville and Weaversville.
14614,1138,"Had another great visit to the Log Cabin Motor Court. We’ve stayed here multiple times and love it. Perfect cabin for our needs. Clean and cozy. Great shower. Nice stop along the way between our home in SC and our family in TN. I do wish the mattresses would receive an upgrade though. Tip: if you’re not used to road noise, pack some earplugs."
14615,1138,"Thanks for the review. We are in the process of replacing some of the mattresses, I'll add this one to the list. Thanks for visiting again!"
14616,1138,Cozy and cute log cabin with all the essential amenities for a comfortable stay. We absolutely loved this place!
14617,1138,Quaint and cozy spot. The small yard for my pups was handy. Area is dog friendly with lots of places to walk them.
14618,1138,Our favorite spot to stay while visiting Asheville!
14619,1138,"Location, location, location! This super cute and quaint cabin is perfectly located for all Asheville has to offer. Cabin is very pet friendly and the fenced in yard was perfect for our pups. Water pressure and temperature in the showers exceeded our expectations and the bed was also extremely comfortable. Would definitely recommend this cabin and will for sure be staying here again in the future!!!!"
14620,1138,"This was our first time staying at the Log Cabin Motor Court and I loved it even more than I expected! The cabin was clean, cozy, and had everything we needed for a weekend trip. Our dog loved the fenced-in yard (we stayed in Cabin 4) and I think my favorite part was sitting on the little porch having my coffee or wine.

The staff were so sweet and helpful. Even though I told them we didn’t need fresh towels since we were only there two nights, they kept checking on us to make sure we were okay. Check in/out was a breeze. Downtown was a 10-15 minute drive depending where we were going. We will definitely be visiting again!!! It was a great stay."
14621,1138,"Snug Harbor - Cabin #4 was exactly as described and depicted. It is a very old building. It's a registered historic site, so with that in mind you shouldn't expect anything fancy.
Its pet friendly with a fenced in area which was fantastic for our fur baby. Lots of other cabins had dogs too, but it wasn't at all noisy.
The location was not far from downtown Asheville but we did have to drive a bit to get to the hiking trails and waterfalls in the Pisgah National Forest. Easy drive though.
We would definitely stay again!"
14622,1138,Very cool cabin!!A+ hosts
14623,1138,one of the great places I have stayed. not often does one get to stay in a 100+year old cabin and feel the history that has transpired through the century. definitely a highlight. hope to return one day soon.
14624,1138,"As always, a fun stay at a charming cabin!"
14625,1138,Charming little cabins that were perfect for a weekend exploring Asheville and Blue Ridge!
14626,1138,Exactly as the pictures show. Clean and perfect for weekend for 2
14627,1138,"These cabins are charming. The one we stayed in had important things we needed such as: a king size bed, a kitchen, heaters, and a fenced in yard for our dog! Plus, it was very clean. Just remember these cabins are original and rustic. I loved the charm of this little group of cabins! One negative is the area immediately around the cabins- like old cars and junky establishments very close. There is an excellent guest book that we accidentally forgot to return. It was so well done!"
14628,1138,"Such a cute little cabin! Rustic, but perfect for our needs and within easy drive of Asheville and other points of interest. Appreciated the cabin’s proximity to a great Bavarian restaurant as well."
14629,1138,The host canceled this reservation 50 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
14630,1138,We loved this cabin! The fenced in yard was great for our dogs. Weaverville had a great pizza place and an amazing bakery. The cabin had everything we needed.
14631,1138,"Very pleasant, unique lodging, nice outdoors environment, we enjoyed our stay."
14632,1138,"The Log Cabin Motor Lodge is a wonderful place to stay. We stayed in The cabin named Snug Harbor. It had everything we needed to relax and enjoy our vacation. It was extremely easy to get to downtown Asheville. We enjoyed checking out Weaverville, as well. We will definitely stay there in the future!"
14633,1138,Check out the Thunder Road cabins!
14634,1138,"very nice!Good location,Did not have to get on highway to get to any location we went to!Did a lot of sightseeing."
14635,1138,Lovely stay
14636,1138,"Loved the area, and the cabins. Check in was easy and the cabin it self was clean and cozy. We were sad it rained all weekend, and plan on coming back. We will definitely be looking to stay here again.
Thank you"
14637,1138,This was our 4th time staying at one of the cabins. Convenient location and pet friendly. I really liked that Cabin 4 had a closed in fenced area for our dogs to roam. Definitely plan on staying here again when we return to Asheville.
14638,1138,"Worked out great, easy check in and out. Not far from Asheville. Nice cabin setting with modern conveniences."
14639,1138,Super great cabin!! The fenced in area was perfect for our pup. Our favorite part was how close it was to downtown Asheville and the biltmore— just a 10 minute drive. We would definitely stay again!
14640,1138,We enjoyed our stay in John and Maria’s comfy and cozy log cabin. The bed was very comfortable and the cabin had all we needed. It was a quick drive downtown Asheville. We were able to get everywhere we needed in 10 minutes or less.
14641,1138,"Great location and clean, comfortable accommodations. Loved the cabin feel and the front porch."
14642,1138,Excellent location - very easy access to downtown Asheville! Cabins are cozy and an authentic experience!
14643,1138,We had a great stay here! We'll definitely be back.
14644,1138,"Weather was not great, cabin was cozy."
14645,1138,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Snug Harbor. The cabin was clean, and the bed was comfortable. We love that the location is close to town and the mountains, but still very private and quiet. This was our second visit, and we know it won't be the last!"
14646,1138,"The log cabin experience was exactly what I expected. Quiet, clean, cozy, and exactly what I’d hoped it would be. Quick ride to Ashville or the Biltmore, both we’re a cheap Uber away. Perfect place for a little couples getaway. We will be back in the spring to check out Asheville again!!"
14647,1138,The facilities are great. My husband and I call it romantic rustic. The grounds are great and very close to actives that are in Asheville. We found that having a cabin with a private fence was wonderful to have for our Charlie (pet). We will be back!
14648,1138,What a great place to stay! Close to downtown/cheap Uber and so neat. Perfect if you’re carrying a pet because the yard at the cabin is fenced in. Awesome couples getaway! 10/10 would stay again. Great value!
14649,1138,"Thank you for reviewing Cabin 4 - Snug Harbor, one of our cabins with a fenced yard for pets. We look forward to having you back!"
14650,1138,Perfect place to stay especially when traveling with a pet.
14651,1138,A unique place to stay and good location for exploring Asheville. Great for staying with pets as well with the fenced in yard. Rustic log cabin feel was as expected. Will be back if we get to return to Asheville again!
14652,1138,The cabin was perfect for the two of us and our fur babies. The fenced in yard was a huge plus! The location is great with just a short easy drive to downtown Asheville. We can’t wait to go back!
14653,1138,"Quiet, low key vibe. Perfect for a couple’s retreat or when you’re going hiking all day with your fur baby!"
14654,1138,"Thank you for your review Hannah. We're glad you enjoyed the quiet, low key vibe of the cabins."
14655,1138,Perfect location for a quick trip to Asheville with a pet.
14656,1138,Thank you for your review Gordon. We're glad you enjoyed your stay with us.
14657,1138,"This was our 5th stay at the cabins. My husband and I love staying there and our dogs enjoy it too. It is a great place with a relaxing environment, but still close to everything in Asheville."
14658,1138,Great place and great location. Extremely clean and quiet.
14659,1138,Great stay in a convenient location. We enjoyed our stay!
14660,1138,Thank you for your review Melanie!
14661,1138,Our stay in Snug Harbor was great! Cute little cabin with hotel amenities. We used the kitchen to cook breakfast daily & our boxer loved people watching from within the fenced in yard. Quick drive/Uber to town. We took the dog to DuPont State Forest (55 minute drive) and had a fabulous day. Highly recommend!!!
14662,1138,Thank you for your review Heather.
14663,1138,"Very quaint place. Quiet neighborhood. Less than 10 minute to downtown. We brought our dog, Gino, and were pleasantly surprised with how pet friendly this place really was. Great stay! Would definitely come again."
14664,1138,Thank you for reviewing your stay in the Snug Harbor cabin. We're glad Gino felt welcome and you found our cabins and amenities to be pet friendly. We look forward to your return.
14665,1138,Had a great two day stay with my husband and our boxer dog. Very convenient location 5 miles from downtown Asheville and not far from many hiking attractions. Very accommodating to dog owners and their companion animals. Our cabin had a fence which allowed our boxer to hang out in his yard which he loved. The hosts had many dog friendly recommendations which was very helpful. Comfortable bed and useable kitchen. Thanks for the great stay!
14666,1138,Thank you for your review Abigail. We're glad you enjoyed the many aspects of the Log Cabin Motor Court and we hope to see y'all again some day!
14667,1138,Very cute and comfortable! We had everything we needed
14668,1141,Allen was super nice! The home was beautiful and my children loved the fire pit and the water. We had an absolute blast having family time there. We can’t wait to come back.
14669,1141,"We love the Bryson city area and go there several times a year. This Spring we wanted to go to take Scott’s mom on another trip. She has Alzheimer’s and lives in an assisted living home. I booked this cabin, which wound up being perfect. Centrally located. Convenient parking to cabin entrance. Lovely stream views from kitchen and bathroom windows. Had weather permitted, we could have sat on porch swing on back deck and looked at stream from there. Worked well for us."
14670,1141,"House was exactly as expected, and worked out well for our fishing trip!"
14671,1141,"great place ,we love"
14672,1141,Stayed only one night but will definitely consider renting again. Was in town for the Polar Express.
14673,1141,Absolutely wonderful stay. Everything matched according to the listing and pictures. So peaceful and beautiful. Allan and his wife were proactive in communication and great hosts.
14674,1141,"Very cozy and cabin feel. Listening to the river outside is so relaxing. Our weekend was booked with things to do downtown and surrounding area but even when we had downtime, we were able to find something to do at the cabin. We stayed here during the winter. I would imagine it’s even more beautiful and fun during the summer!"
14675,1141,This location is perfect for easy access for local activities in Bryson City. The house was perfect for a mountain getaway!
14676,1141,The place felt super cozy. I wish we could have stayed longer. We will definitely stay here again in the future.
14677,1141,"We enjoyed our stay at the Moonshine Creek Waterfront Too! The cabin was cozy, clean, and close to Bryson City."
14678,1141,"We loved this adorable little cabin on the water! It was clean, comfortable and in the perfect location for everything we wanted to do. It was a 13 min drive to the train depot and 8 mins from downtown with fantastic restaurants. The hosts were very kind and hospitable. The kitchen was stocked with all the necessities. The bathroom had some toiletries and the towels smelled very clean and fresh. The beds were super comfortable (even on the bunk bed). The swing on the back porch overlooking the river was a relaxing place to sip a glass of wine and appreciate the beautiful surroundings. I would definitely go back in the summer to take advantage of the tubes!"
14679,1141,The cabin was perfectly described and very cozy! We enjoyed our stay and felt very comfortable. The cabin is also in close proximity to town which made getting around easy. The surroundings of the cabin are picturesque and the cabin inside was very clean and tidy upon arrival. Thank you for allowing our family to enjoy our experience!
14680,1141,Excellent cabin! Beautiful scenery and cozy cabin that made us feel at home!
14681,1141,Thanks so much for choosing Moonshine Creek! Please know that you are welcome back anytime. We wish you safe travels. Allen and Lynn
14682,1141,We had an amazing time at Allen and Lynn's place. We were greeted upon arrival. We definitely enjoyed everything and appreciate all the help and communication. Very responsive. Very clean and great hospitality. Bed was also comfortable. Thank You for an awesome experience!
14683,1141,"This was mine and my husbands first time to Bryson City. We chose Bryson to go on our first train ride together. While on the hunt for an Airbnb, we came across this one. The pictures were magical of the views and surrounding area. However, upon arrival, we quickly felt disappointed. First things first… this review has nothing to do with the owners or anything else, just a honest review from one persons perceptive.
PROS:
*Close proximity to the town of Bryson.
*The small cabin was clean and cozy and had everything needed inside.
*Well furnished including a small gas fireplace.
* A sweet little kitty visitor daily
CONS:
*Although the pictures show a beautiful fire pit area by the creek, it doesn’t tell you that the space is shared with other Airbnb guests close by. Also, was not very well kept.
*The small barn cabin was about 15ft from the road, with loud traffic noise and the other homes were closer than expected.
**if you’re looking for a place to stay that is isolated, private, with great views this is not it. If you’re looking for a place close to town, cozy, and convenient, this is the perfect place for you.
Overall, we enjoyed our stay and the little cabin was a cozy place to come back to after our outings. We met the owners as we were packing to leave and they seemed to be very nice people."
14684,1141,This is a great place. The fire pit by the water was fun. The cabin was totally comfortable.
14685,1141,The home was beautiful and exactly what we were looking for! The kids loved getting to see the train go by and play in the creek. We love Bryson City and this home was the perfect little get away. We will definitely be back!
14686,1141,Very clean and cozy home. We enjoyed the firepit on a chilly night down by the stream. Close to hiking and downtown Bryson City.
14687,1141,really enjoyed it
14688,1141,"Loved it, thanks for a great stay!"
14689,1141,"Wonderful relaxing atmosphere with beautiful cabin decor! Great helpful and friendly hosts! Would definitely visit again and recommend to anyone looking for a beautiful, peaceful, and one with nature type vacation!
Thanks so much!
Kathy"
14690,1141,Beautiful location and great accommodations.
14691,1141,The house was great! Perfect location and had everything we needed! Would definitely stay again as this is a yearly trip for us.
14692,1141,"Nice little cabin on the Alarka Creek. The location was central and a few minutes to Bryson City, Nantahala Outdoor Center, and Cherokee. All the amenities you would need. The creek was shallow and good for kids with some deeper holes for fishing nearby. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay here again."
14693,1141,We would recommend this perfect little cabin to anyone! We had an amazing time and we will be going back soon!
14694,1141,"Thank you for sharing your little piece of heaven with us. It’s hard saying goodbye when we had a such a wonderful time here. We got to meet Allen he is a good kind man and we meet Lynn on our last day headed out. She is a very lovely woman. They are such wonderful hosts. The cabin had everything we needed. The lights went out no worries the generator kicked in. That’s a blessing in itself. The king size bed was comfortable after long day of having fun. The cabin is very clean and cozy. The cabin is in a good location. I walked in the creek to cold for me to get in the tube. But they have everything you need to enjoy it.
We had lunch at CJ’s. If you are looking for a good breakfast and great atmosphere go to Everette Street Diner downtown Bryson. We took the train ride and that is always fun."
14695,1141,"Wonderful place right on the river, minutes away from Bryson city, comfortable and clean. Great host. Kids loved the river and location, would stay again."
14696,1141,"Great location for all that Bryson City has to offer. Friendly hosts, beautiful creek access with fire pits, hammocks and tubes. Cozy cabin was perfect for a low-key family weekend. Our girls loved the bunk room and the kitten that visit our porch. Would definitely stay again."
14697,1141,"A wonderful place to stay. The cottage was so comfortable and well equipped. The location is just outside of town very close to everything. Sitting down at the stream after a day out allowed us to relax after a busy day out. Wi-Fi in the house worked very well; we were able to stream some shows and could keep in touch with our family. Parking was good, the deck and porch swing were also great. The kitchen was pretty well stocked and the bedding and linens were better than expected. Overall, it was great.
Bryson City has lots of activities very close by; tubing in deep creek, winery just the other side of town, Gatlinburg isn't too far away along with Ashville, Nantahala Gorge, and you can't miss the road to nowhere!
As far as the hosts, if Airbnb had a level ABOVE Superhosts, Allen and Lynn would be the the first to join that group. They made us feel so welcome and comfortable. When leaving we couldn't decide what we would miss the most; the cottage or Lynn and Allen's company."
14698,1141,If you’re looking for a nice cabin next to the creek this is the place. The hosts were very prompt with responding and greeted us upon our arrival since they live next door. It was very clean and well stocked just like being at home.
14699,1141,This was an excellent place to stay. It’s in a great location to many different attractions including the railroad and the outdoor center. We also spent time at deep creek and the road to no where.
14700,1141,"This is our second stay in one of Allen's properties, & this was a five star experience, too! He & Lynn are easy to reach by phone, through the app, or by walking next door! They are so hospitable & respond promptly to needs that arise. This location can't be beat! We enjoyed being less than a 10 minute drive from Bryson City, with a shallow creek in the backyard...fun for both kids & adults! The Great Smoky Mountains Railroad train passes by the cabin (on the other side of the creek) twice a day, which is fun to watch. The cabin is clean, comfortable, & well stocked. The wifi is fast & reliable. Wonderful stay!"
14701,1141,Great location on a stream. Kids loved playing in it. Fire pit was great for s'mores. Clean and well maintained.
14702,1141,Beautiful place to stay. Very clean and the best hosts. Enjoy relaxing by the stream and watching the train go by in the afternoon. We will definitely be back!
14703,1141,"Amazing stay! This is a super cute and quaint cabin on the river. We swam, fished, tubed, roasted marshmallows, and picnicked by the river. The kids can minnow fish on the little beach. You really don’t have to go anywhere. If you just want to relax, this is the place. We did this for several days, but we also went to Smokey Mountain National Park, Deep Creek, the Great Smokey Mountain Railroad, Cooper’s Fish Farm, Clingman’s Dome, Mingus Corn Mill, the Riad to Nowhere, and Lake Fontana. It is close to major highways and the Blue Ridge Parkway, but still secluded when you want that tranquility. The hosts go above and beyond and are truly wonderful people. We will be back for sure! Thanks you Lynn and Allen for our best stay with Air B and B.!"
14704,1141,The cabin is very clean and well stocked with everything you may need. There are 3 flights of stairs to go down to the creek so be aware of that. Also close to the road so there is traffic sounds. However it was perfect for me and my mother because of being so close to Bryson city and not having to drive up a mountain. Also accessible for people with movement restrictions. We loved it.
14705,1141,Easy access to this location and close to Bryson and Nantahala activities. Great little cabin next to the relaxing rush of the river where you can build a fire and just lose the world as you melt into the peacefulness of natures bliss.
14706,1141,Great little cabin. Private location but still close to local amenities and attractions.
14707,1141,"Clean, comfortable, and cozy. Having a fire by the creek was relaxing, and the firewood was provided. Good wifi and great weekend getaway!"
14708,1141,"Great host, Beautiful properties and the pictures of the fire pit do not do it justice. Sitting down by the creek listen to the water run by and the crackle of a fire…. Plus the train coming out of Bryson city passing by you around 1045 you can’t beat it !"
14709,1141,Nice place. Good value. Inviting Hosts.
14710,1141,"Our family had a wonderful time time! Beautiful area, husband loved the fishing, kids played at the creek and loved seeing the train come by. Great location. We will definitely be back to stay again. Alan and Lynn were most helpful."
14711,1141,Great hosts and great location! We will be back next year!
14712,1141,"Loved our stay! 2 adults and 3 kids, great use of space! We enjoyed the sound of the rushing water as we feel asleep at night. Fire pit with wood included was perfect for s'mores. Used grill for dinner second night. The home was well stocked with the basics - much appreciated! Close to all we wanted to do - national park and checking out Sylva & Bryson City- in a beautiful natural setting. Kids thought seeing a beaver along the waters edge was so cool! Allen & Lynn are so kind, too."
14713,1141,we enjoyed our stay. it was so relaxing sitting by the river having a fire. very nice place to stay. we were a party of 3 adults and the cabin was perfect for us. owners are on-site but give you your privacy. I would totally book this cabin again. and the porch swing on the porch was awesome!
14714,1141,"This was the most welcoming and relaxing little trip. Allen and his wife were very hospitable and were very responsive. We enjoyed quick chats with them in occasion as well. They are good hearted folks. Moonshine Creek is a quaint little place that is convenient to local attractions and spots but still gives you the seclusion of the mountain home🥰 We will definitely be staying here routinely for mini vacations. We brought our 3 young children as our oldest had a competition in a nearby town- we were all very cozy and it made for a relaxing family time trip. The creek really tops it off, just a quick zig-zag stairway down the mountain and you can enjoy a peaceful time by the water. You can’t beat good quality, good folks, and good times! I would highly recommend!"
14715,1141,"A great place to stay! Owners were fabulous and made sure that everything was just right. Super clean, very convenient to Bryson City. Great getaway sitting stream side on a peaceful flowing creek."
14716,1141,This place is absolutely gorgeous. Very quite and very peaceful place. Allen and his wife are great host. They make sure you have everything you need. The fire pits by the river are supplied with wood. Most places you have to take your own. It’s well worth the money you pay and it’s an absolute gorgeous view. Highly recommended if you want a nice cozy peaceful place away. Very clean and everything you need inside. Was even offered more blankets if we needed because it was snowing the weekend we stayed. They are right next door so if you need anything all you have to do is ask. Thank you both for everything y’all are truly amazing with an awesome place to stay.
14717,1141,Mr. Allen was so helpful and kind. WONDERFUL location. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!
14718,1141,Allen and his wife were incredibly accommodating and made sure we had all we needed! It was a lovely stay for us. It was an extra touch to hear the creek babbling throughout the stay!
14719,1141,"great little house, we would definitely stay again"
14720,1141,"We really enjoyed our stay, Allen and Lynn are the nicest and most welcoming people. They addressed all our questions quickly and properly.
The house was very nice and cozy. Thank you!"
14721,1141,all things were wonderful! the fact I did not have to bring my own firewood was the icing on the cake. Beautiful views!!!!!!
14722,1141,"Very clean and even decorated with cute seasonal decor! Convenient to shopping and dining but still located in a peaceful, natural setting!"
14723,1141,"Cozy, comfortable and clean! Very nice base to have for your mountain adventures. We are already planning our return."
14724,1141,"Wonderful little cabin overlooking a gurgling stream, neat as a pin, immaculate, hosts Allen and Lynn were very nice and accommodating when we had to change the date of our stay at the last minute. Great stay, great experience!"
14725,1141,"What a wonderful little cabin! So
Clean and charming, it even had a small decorated Christmas tree which made it feel extra cozy! We will hopefully get to stay again when we go back to the polar express next year. We arrived late at night and pulled into the wrong driveway by mistake which led us to try and get into the wrong house! Allen was available by phone and sent his daughter over to help us get in promptly. We felt so bad when we realized we were at the wrong house but we’re so grateful for their hospitality!"
14726,1141,You can’t go wrong staying here at this sweet little cabin. The owners are very nice and welcoming. Very clean and neat. Had everything we needed and even things that you may forget. I can’t wait to plan another trip so we can stay here again.
14727,1141,"Moonshine Creek cabin is simply perfect! Allen is beyond hospitable and truly makes your stay “the best stay ever!” My family of 5 were cozy and lacked nothing during our visit. The creek, fire pit, fireplace, decor…everything made our stay wonderful and fun.
The kitchen is wonderfully stocked! I have stayed in many Airbnb’s and this one by far has the best stocked kitchen. Even storage containers for left overs!
The full bath was spacious and plenty of towels and soaps provided.
The bed was comfy and nice to crash out on and watch tv after a long day of adventure.
This cabin is close to downtown Bryson City, Deep Creek trailhead, clingmans Dome, tumbling waters trout pond (thanks for the recommendation Mr Allen!) Also close to the road to nowhere. A short drive to The Tail of the Dragon and Fontana Dam isn’t far from Moonshine Creek cabin.
I truly highly recommend the stay if you’re in or passing through Bryson City!"
14728,1141,"Super clean, felt like home. Loved the fire pit on the river and watching the ducks in the water…so relaxing!"
14729,1141,Very cozy ! Very hospitable and sweet owners . Will be returning . Awesome view to the creek waterfront and close to shops and food.
14730,1141,We felt like we were coming home every time we returned back to the cabin during our trip! It was extremely clean and super cozy with all the amenities we could’ve needed. The bed was extremely comfortable which isn’t something you get a lot of time with Airbnb stays. Will definitely stay here again if we’re ever back in the area!
14731,1141,"This place was perfect location we hit Bryson city (8 minutes a way) several times, Mingo falls, the blue ridge parkway, Asheville, the Bryson train ride. Spent some relaxing moments on the bank of the river just a few steps away from our cabin. The Cabin was clean and comfortable highly recommend this place!!!!!
Dale and Celita"
